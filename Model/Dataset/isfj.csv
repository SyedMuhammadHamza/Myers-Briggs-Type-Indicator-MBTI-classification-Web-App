isfj,"Hi!

First off, you sound like a really nice person, and I am so glad that you understand that ISFJs don‚Äôt tend to open up very easily. It‚Äôs a trait that I think a lot of us have, and can stem from many different reasons.

ISFJs, or at least me and the other ones I have met, do tend to keep our thoughts and emotions to ourselves. It‚Äôs not always that we don‚Äôt want to share, but situational factors play into it a lot. I know for myself that I only tend to open up to people I am comfortable with in a relaxed setting, and if I feel like I am going to be actually listened to. There have been so many times where I have tried sharing my heart with people, only for them to completely brush me aside and move on to what they want to talk about. It might seem small, but it hurts. I think your boyfriend trusts you, and I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs what is happening here, but take these factors into play when trying to get him to open up. Build trust, pick a comfortable environment (quiet, not a lot of people, relaxed), and make sure to listen.

Another thing is this: ISFJs tend to be emotional support in almost all of their relationships. People are constantly coming up to me for advice and comfort, and while I genuinely love helping and supporting them, it can be so easy to feel like there is not support for yourself.  When you are helping others, you aren‚Äôt telling them your struggles or how your day has been. They don‚Äôt need that. You are instead putting all of your focus on them and their needs. It can be emotionally exhausting! There are some friendships where I don‚Äôt open up because that person just needs an anchor where they can vent, cry, share, etc. If this is true for your boyfriend, I think that even just telling him that you are there for him and that you want to hear what he thinks is big. Genuinely ask him how he is! I rarely get asked that except superficially, and it always makes my day when someone really wants to know how I am.

Another thing, ISFJs need some time alone to process their emotions. I know when I have a rough day, the first thing I want to do is go home and just decompress and process what happened and how I am feeling. I am not always ready to talk to someone, even if I know it might help or that they have the best intentions of supporting me. It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt need or want it, but it just comes later when it is time. I think when people want to come and support me, it can be easy for me to push my own feelings aside so that I look like everything is okay. I don‚Äôt want others to be worried or concerned for me, so in part I am sabotaging myself from being fully understood. Hopefully that makes sense. 

It sounds like you both care about each other very much, even if you show it in different ways. Keep finding ways to support each other and learning how to understand each other better. Communicate your thoughts and concerns, and I am sure with time and effort he will start opening up and reciprocating! I wish you both the best of luck, and only hope that your love and care for each other grows! ü•∞",1617467139

isfj,"I was equally at home whether outdoors or in my room, but I never mixed the two. I would spend all day with the kids across the street riding bikes and combing everything in sight, but on other days I wanted to be completely alone in my room with my toys, books and hobbies. My room was a quiet sanctum, to which no-one was invited. I wanted my room to be like a library.

I remember feeling hyper aware of who was being included or not from very early on. I was internally unsettled by anyone being left out and would find myself quietly going off to play with whoever was being ignored. This was compulsive, like a sense you just couldn‚Äôt ignore. 

The disabled kids, girls and weaker kids were to be protected at all costs, that‚Äôs just how I felt.
There was a strong tendency to befriend the misfits through school, but very quietly. I was not a gregarious kid by any stretch of the imagination. Sometimes just sitting with someone who was being ignored in the lunchroom was enough. 

 I cannot ever remember punishment of any kind. My inner need to never be ‚Äòin trouble‚Äô was stronger than any temptation toward wrongdoing until my late teens, but even that was minimal. Fighting with my parents simply wasn‚Äôt a reality, it was incomprehensible to me. In fact, I had my first actual disagreement with my Mom when I was about forty five.",1617457800
isfj,"Just my opinion. It's NOT about finding out who you are. Its about becoming who you want to be. Make a list of qualities and be that person. Do you want to be a good listener, loyal, etc.",1617449458
isfj,"Self-confidence and self-esteem is something you're going to have to work on over the course of your entire life. It's not something that you can just improve and have it stick. There will always be times where you're full of self-confidence and then something will come along and break that and you have to figure out how to bring the balance back again.

It may not seem like it happens with some people but I can assure you everyone has a breaking point where they lose confidence in themselves even the most self-confident people. 

Continue to put yourself out there when you've got the energy to do so, and you will eventually find someone you click with who will be a great friend for you. 

Humans are social creatures and will always want to be with others, so I can assure you that you're not the only person who's sometimes feeling desperate for friends. Trying to worry less about seeming weird to other people and accept yourself for who you are and just be okay with that, and learning to be okay with being alone sometimes, will do wonders for your ability to make friends.",1617444426

isfj,"This is 100% me. I have a hard time making real connections with people. Sometimes i step up and try my best to socialize and make friends, I can see that people like me and want to include me but their friendships feel fake and I dont feel like myself either. I start declining events and going back to my comfortable bubble where i dont really talk to people and just chill by myself.

I have friends online through gaming and its all I need for my social needs. Sometimes I gets sad I dont really have friends to do things with but then I remember friends are a huge effort and it never feels as good and ""real"" as I think so I drop it.

I don't have a solution for you, just saying youre not alone. Ive came to accept that im weird and after finding an equally weird boyfriend i find myself really happy and not needing those outside connections as much. :)",1617429882

isfj,"Well you asked for Fe specifically... First, we have to say that our development is about external factors, thus we all may have different experiences/how our childhood was. 


During childhood, it's supposed to be that Ni is like, the only function INFJ uses and Si for ISFJ. Combine them with very small Fe. Theory is that your aux function is fully developed at age 20, tert and inferior ones are never fully developed. Together, Si+Fe and Ni+Fe are 90% of the personality. That was Jung's theory. You don't have to believe it at all. 


If we try taking theory into the perspective... My Fe started developing at the age of 7? When I went to school for the first time. Till that time, I was mostly alone or with friends I knew. Any kid is playful, imo nothing with Fe, it's just what kids do. But I remember being one of the more ""inwards"" turned kids, that's for sure. I was scared of new experiences and people and I often wondered for hours in my mind. It's sounds like such ~not like the other kids~ but yeah. Sorry. But really, that was what I loved the most. Just being on a swing, thinking/daydreaming. I hated when someone came up to me and wanted me to join other kids in playing. Don't get me wrong, I liked playing, but don't get into my swing space lol and don't want me to play with anyone else than just my group of friends. Oh and, I hated being in huge crowds. I was often trying to find some quiet places, just to be alone. I hated fast things too, and sensory stimulations, I was really clumsy and I still am. I was easily lost in my head... inferior Se kicking in. But Fe made me really obedients and respectful towards authorities. If my teacher was angry at me, I felt like a failure.


Later, I started having first school friendships and my Fe still wasn't developed. I was a ""I know this person, I'll stay just with them"" kid, attached, yet alone. I had my group and I didn't need more people. I was just about deepering the bonds I already had.


Slowly, I started caring about people as if it was a group. On an universal scale. Never on a huge group scale. This is the difference between SFJs and NFJs. SFJs tend to care about their loved ones and nothing big picture. NFJs are here for big picture. 


Now I don't mind having more friends, but I totally prefer a couple of deep friendships over having a lot of friends. I'm much more sociable too and I'm seriously affected by the group's mentality or mentality of people I am with. I care a lot, even about strangers and how everyone feels. I just want people to be okay and happy. But then tert Ti clashes it with wanting to be right and loyal to the facts lol.


That how my childhood was. You can't really talk about your aux function without the main one. They are connected.


Ig I got overboard with my analysis but oh well.",1617423675
isfj,"Agreed. Overly so almost. Probably the easiest kid to raise. Even though people probably liked me more as a kid/teen, I like myself more now with well developed Ti and the ability to say, ‚Äúno, thanks‚Äù.

I was overly worried about how I may effect others as a kid (decisions, things I said). Very submissive. Very polite. Too eager to say ‚Äúyes‚Äù to do things for others, because it‚Äôs the right thing to do. 

Now I‚Äôm more of a free thinker, see many different perspectives.... and largely don‚Äôt care what people think nearly as much I used to... by a lot. I easily say ‚Äúno‚Äù to things I don‚Äôt want to do. Because saying ‚Äúyes‚Äù isn‚Äôt the right thing to do if it‚Äôs not the right thing for me too.",1617423567

If I must pick something, it‚Äôs knowing when to not Fe once your Fe is more developed. I feel my entp gets taken advantage of because he wants others to like him so much, so he‚Äôll say ‚Äúyes‚Äù to things even when he probably shouldn‚Äôt (ie he‚Äôs been feeling exhausted because he never takes time off... and instead of taking time off he says ‚Äúyes‚Äù to picking up more hours). I know he tries to ‚Äúlogic‚Äù it with ‚Äúmaybe it‚Äôll be the reason I get xyz position and they won‚Äôt‚Äù.... but a huge chunk of it is simply wanting to be liked. Fe child.

isfj,"Thank you for your encouraging response. I appreciate your sharing your experience and I find your conclusions very refreshing because it‚Äôs a clear step in the right direction for the typology community as a whole. Thank you for contributing to that. 

As you know, the human mind does not exist in a rigid, inflexible state, one would think this to be the elephant in the room, but sadly many of the opinions on this subject continue to exhibit adherence to the rigid inflexibility of a system that simply cannot accommodate the reality of cognition. 

Sadly, we‚Äôre still spending great swaths of time on these subs explaining why the ‚ÄòJ‚Äô and ‚ÄòP‚Äô designations are causing tremendous confusion and thus mistyping virtually everyone and should thus be removed from our vocabulary. It‚Äôs exhausting.

As for the ‚Äòsensor‚Äô vs ‚Äòintuitive‚Äô question, I would like to offer a hypothesis. 

Human beings all possess the ability to appreciate sensations, just as we all possess intuition. These qualities flow naturally moment to moment and never truly ‚Äòfix‚Äô as a defining factor of a person. Much like happiness, sadness, fear and anger, sensations and intuitions are ubiquitous possessions of the human organism as a species rather than the sole possession of a limited segment of society.

With that in mind, I personally find to use such categories as a defining element in determining overarching cognitive process would be powerfully misleading as we chase the truth of ourselves back and forth in attempting to satisfy a binary conception when no such categorization actually exits. 

Though there are many good examples of this, for now let‚Äôs consider the FiSe. We understand that Fi will always essentially ‚Äòbe‚Äô the dominant function, however we also recognize that in the highly subjective internal world of such a person the Ni which according to a purely MBTI perspective sits in the ‚Äòthird slot‚Äô, actually more readily slides into it‚Äôs more natural position as the like oriented auxiliary to the dominant. 

Once you experience someone possessing a strong tendency to operate with Fi supported by a prominent Ni you may very well have a very difficult time accepting that you‚Äôre not seeing an Ni dominant. In fact their Ni flavored worldview paired with powerfully subjective feeling can possess a depth of emotionally charged perception that can take one by surprise. Therefore would we consider them a ‚Äòsensor‚Äô or an ‚Äòintuitive‚Äô? In reality, what would we gain by doing so, and for what purpose?

On a deeper level, as a community we must consider that such labels don‚Äôt contribute to our ability to relate to each other, but rather run the risk of creating yet another form of segregation. In a world as divisive as this, we certainly don‚Äôt need more reasons for division.

Fi linked with Si is an interesting pair. I can see how one would have difficulty deciphering whether Si was more prominent as both are powerfully subjective functions which when paired in such a way it can be difficult to tell which is serving the other. 

I have a very close friend who is INFP who runs FiSi as readily as I run SiTi. She is ‚Äòalmost‚Äô as past oriented as I am, but the delineating factor is the way her personal emotions rule over all (Fi) whereas with me it‚Äôs a constant breaking down of information as it relates to the record of time (Si/Ti) and what ultimately ‚Äòmakes sense‚Äô. 

She also uses Ne as more of a ‚Äòcreative tool‚Äô, secondary to the Fi/Si. I see it as much in the way I shift to Fe/Ne socially, in a similar ‚Äòcreative‚Äô way, but it‚Äôs always running behind the Si/Ti.

Hopefully some of this resounds or is otherwise helpful. 

Be well. üôè",1617388324
isfj,"Thank you for sharing!

isfj,"Funny to stumble on this question, as I've recently been lightly flirted with by an INTJ - asked to grab a bite and workout together. He was surprisingly friendly for an INTJ, but unsurprisingly straight forward, despite us not knowing each other before he approached me.  I'm happily in a relationship so of course I turned him down politely, but we're still friendly with each other. I thought he was ENFP at first actually because of how outwardly bouncy and friendly he was toward me. He said he's not like that with everyone, just a select few he's interested in knowing more about.

Other INTJs I've encountered are much less friendly than this one - a bit more stoic. Their polr Fe makes it hard for me to interact with them. Not seeing emotional visual cues makes it hard to read them.

In summary, I have never been attracted to INTJs I'm aware of. I wouldn't say I actively avoid them, but I am neutral in feelings towards the ones I've encountered. 

Of course that isn't to say in the future I wouldn't become great friends with one. My pool of INTJ interactions have been small and short-lived afterall.",1617386281

isfj,"Rising_M00n did a really nice job of explaining the dynamics at work with this potential mistype.

In fact, as I think about it there may be more of a tendency for the ISFJ to ‚Äòtest‚Äô as INTP than the inverse. I say this because while I know the ISFJ possesses a far more conscious Ti than is ever discussed, I don‚Äôt truly think a given INTP would possess an Fe conscious enough to cause them to mistype toward ISFJ. I could be wrong, but I‚Äôll throw that out there for now.

Personally, I test as INTP quite often as I entertain myself with online assessments for fun now and then. In fact there‚Äôs a typologist on youtube who has created his own system of notation to better reflect the true cognition of each type and within that system he refers to the ISFJ as the ISTFn. He does so as a way of acknowledging Ti as the true auxiliary to Si from a Jungian standpoint because of their like orientation. 

I believe in this perspective because I resound with it in my own life. I‚Äôve never considered Fe as my auxiliary function, though I know I‚Äôm dominant Si and I‚Äôm absolutely Ne inferior. Yet I also know I‚Äôm an adept Fe ‚Äòuser‚Äô, but it‚Äôs not in it for the long haul. Add to it that I use zero Te and ISTJ is ruled out.

I think that perceiving dominants focus more on their perceptions and acquiring novel ones but for ExxPs it might be a bit more about actually getting new information while IxxJs also focus on seeing the information they already have in a new way (but not by judging it). Those things go hand in hand though so especially people who have a more developed inferior function would engage a lot in the opposite as well.
Judging dominants on the other hand care more about judging the information based on what's morally or logically correct so that they can integrate it into their framework.",1617309400

I'd love to delve a bit more on being perceiving vs judging dominant, like ESFP vs ENTJ for example. It looks like perceiving dom's seek the experience of novelty itself. While judging dom's work in their framework and create from within that. What do you think?",1617308792

isfj,"It's probably common because they share the same functions and stereotypically introverted or intellectual ISFJs might relate more to the way INTPs are typically portrayed. There are also a lot of misconceptions about Si which is why a lot of SJs don't resonate with it.

ISFJs lead with an Introverted Perceiving function which means that their focus is more on accumulating new information and perspectives that get stored into their collection of sensory impressions. Generally the other functions tend to be used in order to support the first one(s) which means that an an ISFJ might use Ti or Ne in order to get new insights of what they've perceived or to make an Fe judgment. As the inferior function Ne tends to be more negativistic and therefore focuses more on the possible (negative) consequences or things that could go wrong instead of optimistic outcomes. 

INTPs lead with an Introverted Perceiving function which means that their focus is more on coming to a conclusion about what's logically correct and makes sense to them personally. They tend to seek Si impressions in order to come to this judgment or in order to come up with new Ne possibilities instead of seeking those things just for the sake of it.
Because Fe is inferior they can often be rather indifferent to judgment through the values of the external world (especially if it doesn't hold up to their idea of what they think is logical) and they're less concerned with influencing other people. 

It's also important to mention that those are just tendencies and the way those types often present themselves or what they focus on. People act differently depending on what the situation asks for so an ISFJ might still want to come to a logical conclusion for the sake of it just like an INTP might value acquiring new experiences and impressions for the sake of it.",1617303241

It‚Äôs like a blind man grasping at falling leaves.

That said...

I will address the seven points you have presented as follows in accord with my experience as an SiFe and having lived with a true FiNe. I say ‚Äòtrue‚Äô because the mistypings are rampant in the typology community, but in this case I can assure you of accuracy so as to make your own judgments unshaded by the useless stereotypes often found online. 

Also...

**The comments I make are in no way an attempt to correct you individually, but are made to benefit the collective audience that happens upon this thread because you have presented a fantastic question about the contrast of two sometimes similar types and your observations are excellent. Thank you for your patience and understanding.

1. ‚ÄúHe judges everything‚Äù- It is true that Fi dominants by definition lead with introverted judgement and can most definitely be ‚Äòjudgemental‚Äô, but Fe users in general can be ‚Äòjudgemental‚Äô as well, no matter how Fe is prioritized in the psyche. In fact, all human beings can be ‚Äòjudgemental‚Äô to a greater or lesser degree. The additional point I would like to convey is that the common usage of the term ‚Äòvalues‚Äô in relation to Fi is an overstated misapplication we often read online. All human beings possess and will at times enforce their ‚Äòvalues‚Äô as it is one of the factors that separate us from other beings. So ‚Äòvalues‚Äô should really be struck from the record as an indicator of Fi vs Fe prioritization. It‚Äôs not your fault, I just want to make this point for the benefit of whoever else reads this. 

2. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs emotionally attached to the past‚Äù. - Both ‚Äòtypes‚Äô can be this way for slightly different reasons. Those reasons are subjective and could never be teased out by a third party on a texted forum. Being focused on ‚Äòtraditions‚Äô, though a consistent ISFJ stereotype is another falsehood. Any person at all can value tradition if they are raised to appreciate it for whatever reason. The ISFJ will most certainly value ‚Äòtheir‚Äô traditions which represent more of a ‚Äòroutine‚Äô. However I know the INFP is known to be the same way. In the same way, though the INFP would possess an overarching future orientation, the ISFJ is just as capable of seeing ‚Äúhow the world could be in the future‚Äù. The INFP sees the future through the lens of Ne, whereas the ISFJ sees the future based upon past precedents already established.

3. ‚ÄúHe always eats the same type of food from his childhood.‚Äù - Both can do this. In fact anyone can do this. 

4. ‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt ‚Äòdo‚Äô anything all day‚Äù- Both can be this way. The historical content ‚Äòmay‚Äô hedge toward more of an Si fix as history does lie more in the ISFJ ballpark, but it‚Äôs not a guarantee. However, both types can definitely zone out of the real world and live in their head. 

5. ‚ÄúIn his view there‚Äôs always a right/wrong way..‚Äù This one is tricky. Though the whole typology world seems to be hung up on the ‚Äòvalues = Fi‚Äô thing, I will again offer that this is very misleading. Fe will absolutely insist upon the idea that everyone ‚Äòshould‚Äô be doing things a certain way. This one sounds like me when I‚Äôm not at my best actually üò¨

6. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not efficient at all.‚Äù- I must offer that this ‚Äòcould‚Äô be either...However, if I had to choose I would offer that the INFP can and often will be more ‚Äòefficient‚Äô than the ISFJ. 
**Explanation: The ISFJ  is a lead introverted perceiver. Perception is the prioritized mode of general operation. Personally, though I am undoubtedly ISFJ, I operate mostly as SiTi, then FeNe. Ti is not ‚Äòefficient‚Äô by any stretch of the imagination. Ne is my ‚Äòinferior‚Äô, but as Jung stated, the inferior is not weaker, just ‚Äòunassigned‚Äô. Ne can cause me big problems because I find it to be just as powerful as my lead function. I‚Äôm also older, so that does factor in.

Anyway, Te for the INFP, even though ‚Äòinferior‚Äô, will still possess it‚Äôs hallmark ‚Äòefficiency‚Äô. 

Therefore, if I had to choose between these two, I‚Äôd say the ISFJ stands more of a chance to be considered as displaying ‚Äúzero‚Äù efficiency. Also, with the ISFJ, everything is because of the ‚Äòprinciple‚Äô.

7. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs really emotionally invested in other people‚Äù - Both types ‚Äòcan‚Äô can be emotionally invested in other people, both ‚Äòcan‚Äô be scared about the future and both ‚Äòcan‚Äô destroy social harmony. The question is ‚Äòwhy‚Äô they are ‚Äúinvested in other people‚Äù, as well as ‚Äòwhy‚Äô they are ‚Äúscared about the future‚Äù and lastly, ‚Äòwhy‚Äô they are not interested in ‚Äúgroup harmony‚Äù.

A word on Fe...

Though ‚Äògroup harmony‚Äô is often used to denote the characteristic charm of Fe, I would say this is a very kind way of describing it. Personally, as an Fe user I would offer that Fe is better understood if we consider it as a measure of gently applied ‚Äòcontrol‚Äô over the social environment. Sometimes it‚Äôs subtle, sometimes not so subtle, and it is not necessarily ill intended. However, when we look for someone to be seeking ‚Äòharmony‚Äô, we may misinterpret Fe and thus mistype and thereby misunderstand the individual.

I hope this helps you unravel your mystery. I have no final conclusion, I only offer these points for consideration. Again, thank you for your patience in reading through it.

isfj,"Alright. I read everything, and I'm going to say everything that I can do to help you. I'm going to base in my experience and what I see nowadays about ISFJs.

Talking about that situation, I feel like you need to talk with her alone, face to face, and try to understand why she is acting like this. Hanging out with a lot of friends seems exhausting for her, so I would say that is better to avoid more friend meetings.

About the part of she liking you and being jealous about your friend ESFJ it might explain why she is acting like that. Because, when ISFJs are alone with the people they like, they feel more safe. And I know that you're a quiet person, but you will need to make a effort to not be while being with her. And yes, it can be stress, or maybe she doesn't like to talk with you anymore.

If she doesn't want to talk with you irl, talk with her by text, and BE SURE to understand each word that she's speaking. We ISFJs like to be heard, and maybe she's being cold and distant from you because she doesn't feel heard with you ‚Äî correct me if I'm wrong. When we act like that, we want the person to realise that he/she made something wrong, and depending in our amount of mood and stress, we can barely say anything.

Like I said: just try to talk with her alone, and apologise for something that you might did wrong (even if you didn't did anything). Make her feel special, important and most of all, loved! I'm really sorry if this didn't helped at all, and I feel sorry about you, dude. I hope you can get out of that situation. Everything is going to be okay! :)",1617093252
isfj,"Surprises don't work too well for ISFJs. She probably felt pressured and got caught off guard. She needed time to process you being there, when you specifically told her you would be going elsewhere - might as well consider this a lie, which is definitely not good.
Some one on one texting or video call would be good to clear things up before you meet again in person. Try to explain why she suddenly saw you there, how it came about and why you thought it would be a good idea. Be prepared for her to be guarded though, the fact that you have an explanation for what went on doesn't mean she needs to accept it.
Good luck!",1617092538

What I felt for him was so strong that it drove me crazy just thinking about him being with someone else. In the end he got tired of me not trusting in him and found someone else without breaking with me first. After two years we tried to give it a try again, but I just couldn‚Äôt trust him at all now, plus the extreme ‚Äúlove‚Äù that never left. It was pretty toxic.

Now I have a really healthy and lovely relationship with an INFP, I feel at peace with him, and he makes me feel loved, and I don‚Äôt have that obsessive behavior I had with my INTP ex.

My biggest recommendation is try to avoid getting possessive, and don‚Äôt get jealous if he hasn‚Äôt given you any reason to.",1617082208

This way she can reaffirm me and snap me out of it, before I say or do something silly. You could do the same and I‚Äôd strongly advise discussing this with your boyfriend and having a system whereby you can tell him you‚Äôre feeling anxious or scared to be vulnerable so he can snap you out of it.

isfj,"You may have an avoidant attachment style, or at least a disorganised attachment (mix of avoidant and anxious). You may have heard of these. Avoidants are reluctant to be vulnerable as the notion makes them anxious, as well as the idea of committing. All unhealthy attachment styles can cause relationship sabotage too.

The risk feels big and since I‚Äôve never really experienced it I‚Äôm not sure how I‚Äôll be able to be ok if ever it‚Äôs bad.

isfj,"You mentioned you‚Äôve had exes, so perhaps you‚Äôre afraid of being heartbroken again, or things failing. My guess is you‚Äôre at the step whereby you‚Äôre reluctant to completely give all your love and devotion because you feel the risk of being let down is too big. This will need time, but I would advise against keeping your feelings pent up. Trust comes from being vulnerable, and often being vulnerable will help you heal, as long as your partner is understanding and supportive.",1617055854

&gt; Whatever your reason, either you don‚Äôt trust him fully or you always want to be latched to him and do everything with him.

That‚Äôs the thing, I do trust him but I don‚Äôt trust how much I feel for him. I like being in control and relationships to give me that and even if I could control the person I‚Äôd hate it, so that‚Äôs not what I want.",1617054852

There are so many struggling to figure themselves out, I never want to miss an opportunity to offer them something that may help them, whoever they may be.

isfj,"Hi! INFP (20F) here, and I am currently dating an (22M) ISFJ (we‚Äôve met for 6 months and currently been dating for 1.5 months) and I genuinely love him so much. He‚Äôs always there for me and just shows up a lot through actions. But I guess as an INFP, I feel the need to thoroughly know and understand someone through and through as a way to feel emotionally connected and I feel like I don‚Äôt have that with my ISFJ yet. I know it takes time but I just wish I could be there for him now. I guess my main issue lies within feeling that there‚Äôs more to what he‚Äôs saying. For example, when I ask him a question it would be quite straightforward with no elaboration; but when I give answers I tend to say my whole thought process. So I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs just me who‚Äôs very lengthy in my response or if there‚Äôs more to him. Or also sometimes I feel that when I rant to him he only tries to sympathise by validating my emotions but doesn‚Äôt go further to tell me about his opinions (and he really wants to understand me but I‚Äôm not sure if we can). But I don‚Äôt want to accuse him for saying that I think there‚Äôs more to his thoughts ‚Äî well I‚Äôve done that once but he said on his side he felt like he really told me everything he felt already. 

I feel like he trusts me like he would come to me when he‚Äôs feeling upset. He‚Äôs only really opened up to me once about his fears of the future. But other times he could be more reclusive. Like I would know that he‚Äôs feeling sad but I don‚Äôt know why, and I just really want to be there for him and understand him but I don‚Äôt know how when I don‚Äôt even know what he‚Äôs thinking. 

I‚Äôm just worried there‚Äôs no authentic connection or that I don‚Äôt know how to make an authentic connection.

I envy the passion competitive people have. I wish I had that type of drive, energy, and care in regards to winning. But I simply just don't care. For me it's about enjoying the process. If I happen to win and become great in the process, that's a bonus. But winning and being the best is rarely .... in fact, maybe never ...  a motivating factor for me to do something.

Hi! I‚Äôm having trouble typing my father so I just thought I‚Äôd ask for advice from you. Does he sound like an INFP or an ISFJ to you?

- So he judges everything. He‚Äôs really judgy. He always finds something wrong about the values of the government and stuff. I‚Äôm having trouble understanding if this is dom Fi or aux Fe tho. Because the judgments he makes seem personal, but they‚Äôre also related to societal values? ‚Äúthis person is bad because he steals from the government....""

- He‚Äôs emotionally attatched to the past, he really values Si, he‚Äôs all about traditions... But when i asked him about it he said he‚Äôs not focused on the past since he always sees how the world could be in the future.

- He always eats the same type of food from his childhood, he doesn‚Äôt even eat pizza because he didn‚Äôt grow up with it.

- He doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúdo‚Äù anything all day. He‚Äôs not focused on the physical world at all, he‚Äôs not efficent... He just listent to podcasts about history. So this trows me off because he‚Äôs interested in the past which is Si but he doesn‚Äôt act on the real world? seems like he lives in his head.

- In his view there‚Äôs always a right/wrong way to act, and his is always the right way, always people should
conform. Is this Fe? or Fi since he judges right and wrong according to his own values?

- He‚Äôs not efficent at all. Zero. Everything he does seems based on his principles. So could be either inf Te or polr Te idk

- He‚Äôs really emotional invested in other people, too much and he‚Äôs scared about the future. He really does sound like an isfj, maybe he‚Äôs just an unhealthy one because he doesn‚Äôt mantain the group harmony at all, he destroys it

isfj,"So last week I met with my group for a bible session and we were just talking at the end of the meeting, we talked about what we were doing that weekend because ISFJ crush asked, and I told her that I was going to visit a new church this weekend. I asked what church she goes to and she answered so I knew where she went on sundays for church. After the meeting ended and the weekend came around I changed my mind about my plans and decided to just go and visit my college town because I haven't in a while and I know she lives there so I thought maybe this would be a good chance to not only see my friends again but finally meet her in real life, of course she did not know this at the time. So when I visited on the weekend, Sunday came and my other female ESFJ friend said she would be able to pick me up and take me to church (the same church ISFJ told me that she goes to that same week) so me and ESFJ came in a bit late to the service and found a place to sit which was in the top rows behind her and my other friends she was with. once the service was over and everybody started walking out of course we see them and I looked into ISFJs eyes for the first time in real life and it felt so good to see her. I said ""hey! Surprise guys!"" They all seemed happy to see me and she was smiling under her covid mask, we walked out the room and into the lobby of the worship room and stood in a group circle and she asked me how I was and I told her and asked how she was, I asked her how school was going since I know she talked about how she was stressed and I also complimented her on something she did and she seemed appreciative of that and we made a little bit of small talk, I felt like it was a bit awkward tbh because it was weird to see them in real life after like a year and only seeing them during online meetings for an hour or so, and naturally were both quiet people in general, I wish I talked to her more at the time but I was really nervous and just couldn't think straight, plus it was super loud in the lobby with the people and we could barely hear each other so I decided that since it was like 12:30pm I asked the group of like 6 friends if they all wanted to go to lunch together at the time (since it would be more quiet at lunch and I could actually talk to her) they said they couldn't because they're studying which I understand considering it was a spontaneous thing and ISFJs are not very spontaneous people. So I asked my ESFJ friend if she would like to get lunch, and she said she would like to. So we all started walking out of the church and when we walked out of the door and we're walking to our cars I said it was good to see them, she said it back and so I thought I left on a positive note with her. So at lunch with ESFJ friend that afternoon(who is friends with ISFJ crush btw) we just talked about stuff and relationships came up and I told her that I like someone and that she knows her but I didn't say who the person I liked was (she didn't ask me who it was that I liked either) and after we were done with lunch she dropped me off at my friend's that I was staying at and then later that day my ENTP friend I was staying with went to visit another ENFJ friend, we hung out drank, and talked about women, I told him that I liked ISFJ and he said she was attractive but might like another guy in the group because they hang out together sometimes apparently and my ENFJ friend said that one time he came back to his apartment and ISFJ and his roommate were just watching a movie, and ISFJ crush went to use their bathroom and came out with a few button undone which slightly showed off more skin which I found strange because this is new to me. I asked more and more about what she does and he told me some new things I didn't know before. After the hangout and drinking he left to go back to his place and then the next day (which is today) we had prayer meeting online and I decided to go see my INFJ female friend and my ESFJ friend that I hung out with the previous day and went to lunch with, we were sitting on the couch next to each other and then joined the online prayer meeting, we got there a bit early and waited for more people to join including ISFJ crush that joined. I said hi to ISFJ when she joined and she didn't seem to say it back which I thought maybe she didn't hear me or just straight up ignored me which is weird because she usually says hi. After prayer meeting stuff we were talking and we usually talk about anything, I'm usually quiet but sometimes I speak up and try to continue the conversation. Anyway, we talked about conversation starters and I asked a theoretical question, and I didn't hear ISFJs response or she just didn't answer which again is unusual of her, so after a bit more of small talk most people left and immediately after the last person left in the meeting, it was just me and my ESFJ friend on the couch together and her and she said she has to go and before I could even say bye she just left the meeting, and I know she stays up later since it was like 8:50 and she stays up until 11pm so she definitely has time to talk but chose not to, so now I'm thinking that she is being distant because she didn't seem to smile when I was there and be attentive by nodding her head when I'm taking, she actually looked away when I was talking which was super unusual. So now I'm having anxiety that she doesn't like me anymore for some reason and I'm thinking of all the possibilities for why she seemed distant and left early such as maybe she was jealous that I hung out with my ESFJ friend in her apartment on her couch, or that she actually had a lot of stress and that's why she seemed off, or she just doesn't like me anymore.

As usual, we had made plans for this weekend too. Our past dates have been really great. Both of us liked each other, the conversations are free flowing, silences are comfortable, and we talked almost the entire time (weekdays being an exception because of work). Everything was going great until Wednesday, the talks were pretty good too. After Wednesday, I had first pinged on Friday. Didn‚Äôt get a response at all. I assumed she might be busy with work or something so I did not find it strange. I pinged her on Saturday evening to confirm if our plan for Sunday was still on, didn‚Äôt hear back for that as well. Naturally, we didn‚Äôt end up meeting on Sunday. Have tried reaching out to her few times today. Being an INTP, I tend to think and it kinda eats me up not knowing what went wrong to deserve such extreme behavior. I did see her online on an Instagram when I texted her on the app. So was surprised to not hear back.
I honestly wouldn‚Äôt mind if the she wants to break up for some reason. I understand circumstances change and people change with them. But to be completely unresponsive is something that puzzles me. And honestly, she did come off as a great person. So it is even more puzzling.

* Once she was writing a story about a character who hates humanity, can‚Äôt stand women, and said feelings are disgusting. She told me he‚Äôd go to a hotel in Ireland, happily watching the gloomy, rainy weather and getting joy at seeing people panic over flooding
* She doesn‚Äôt pay much attention in class because she‚Äôs usually doodling art during lessons or chatting with friends via notes 
* Her demeanor is a bit blank (for lack of a better word) like she‚Äôs pretty straight faced with a normal speaking tone but still comes across on the friendlier/nicer side
* Tends to rush home after school and rush her homework during school hours to avoid having to do work at home. If she does have work to do at home, she mostly procrastinates
* She said she enjoys being lazy at home and if she‚Äôs out, she likes going to restaurants or stores with friends. She also said isolation drives her insane.
* Although she enjoys going to restaurants, she tends to choose very cheap restaurants. We once got our bill and she asked if we should give tip. I suggested 10% but she only put $1 down. She has self-proclaimed to be too cheap to buy most things
* She took advanced classes in high school, got decent grades, and is majoring in biology in hopes of having a career in research or biotech. 
* She told me she doesn‚Äôt feel anything about mental health because everything that‚Äôs bad she twists up to something good or funny
* However she often vents to me about life, saying things like ‚ÄúKill me‚Äù or other things like how she envies someone‚Äôs grades or how she‚Äôs feeling humiliated or can‚Äôt stand school
* She‚Äôs open about how she feels to me since she vents a lot, but I don‚Äôt know if she‚Äôs open with everyone or just people she feels closer to
* She can be critical of people and judgmental in a sense because she‚Äôs talk about how this person‚Äôs lazy or how that person‚Äôs desperate for attention
* Usually when she gets a bad test score, she‚Äôll tell people she doesn‚Äôt try in school 
* Pretty talkative person but usually is interested in speaking about school topics 
* Got mad once about an arrogant woman with an attitude. She said the woman had a spoiled child personality and doesn‚Äôt appreciate what she has.
* Tends to worry for no reason
* Typically more passive, such as hinting at what she wants instead of directly telling people
* Can be defensive sometimes such as when I corrected her wrong answer during group work. She got mad then decided to not participate in the class activity anymore
* We don‚Äôt speak anymore after I once canceled a hangout on her to take an exam with a classmate. Since then, she gives short replies or ignores me. 
* Likes to write Happy New Year statuses on Facebook. In one message she thanked people who interacted with her, said she made new friends, discovered how misery brings people together, and thanked friends for putting up with her",1615765913

He would initiate texts sometimes and I would reply, and I don't know if this is true or just all in my head but lately he hasn't been really initiating that much anymore, so I initiate and he takes long to reply, phone calls go straight to voicemail. He is a senior, has a job, and is involved in clubs on campus, needless to say he is very busy and I get that. meanwhile I am at home because I graduated and all my friends are still at college. I get that he is busy with school and things like that but I just feel like something happened and I can't put my finger on what happened. I know a few times I called him because I needed small favors or to vent about something that happened to me and he did the favors a d listened and I thanked him for it so I just thought that was okay with him since he didn't seem to care that much so maybe he thinks that I am trying to use him or manipulate him for something but that's not what I'm trying to do at all so I hope he doesn't get that impression and that's why, other than that I can't think of any other reasons he would be mad at me. Maybe I said an insensitive joke one day and never thought anything of it and he got offended and just never spoke up about it, I don't know. Obviously I care about him if I am putting in effort to write this long post, I am looking for some friendly advice on what I should do. Should I confront him and just ask if he is mad at me?

isfj," Okay  so, for a bit of background information we are both black girls, and I  wouldn't have considered her a friend but more of an  acquaintance/someone who I was def on good terms with, a very sweet and  compassionate girl, but over the summer I started a youth activist  organization and planned BLM protests after George Floyd was murdered -  she attended and suggested that we start an Oakland chapter/wanted to  join the org.  I did text her a few times but to follow up but she  didn't come to the further protests we planned and at some point I j  begun to feel like she wasn't really interested and then we had online  schooling and we had progressed a lot as an org by that point so I  didn't know what to do?

We had an  election for Black Student Union around October 2020 and she and this  other popular kid won over me.  I was appointed by the club advisor to a  co-president title because I did most of the work for the club/did a  lot for it even tho I didn't win (started a social media account for it,  set us up for Club Week, talked the most during meetings, actually  suggested we start it back, etc.)  She's a senior, I'm a sophomore

I'm  confused bc I actually voted her to be one of the co-presidents myself  due to her seeming so passionate about BSU, but she hasn't really  done... anything?  She hasn't followed through on any of the ideas she  had (some of which were unrealistic,) she ghosted the club advisor on a  fundraiser, she doesn't make meeting agendas anymore and at this point I  do it, she doesn't come to meetings to help me plan for what we'll be  doing for the month even when she responds and promises she will?  It  actually gets a bit annoying bc she never, ever does what she says she  will. She's sweet so I j forgive her for it and I get the sense that she  has struggled w depression and maybe self-esteem in the past

I'm  confused bc she seemed to genuinely care for the club and she seems so  caring, I know that she has 3 younger siblings and probably schoolwork  but if she cares why isn't she doing more, why is she leaving most of it  to me?  I've tried to text and email her before but she doesn't rlly  respond.

I am curious to see if certain MBTI types are more likely to be HSPs than others, so I am going to post a poll in each subreddit about this. **You can find out if you are an HSP by taking the following test:** [**Are You Highly Sensitive? ‚Äì The Highly Sensitive Person (hsperson.com)**](https://hsperson.com/test/highly-sensitive-test/)**. A score higher than 14 on this test indicates that you might have SPS (you are an HSP).** If you do not like the binary nature of this test you can take the version used by researchers here: [Microsoft Word - HSPSCALE\_2007\_research.doc (hsperson.com)](http://hsperson.com/pdf/HSPSCALE_2007_research.pdf). A score of 105 or higher on this version indicates that you likely are an HSP (I calculated this cutoff by using the cutoff for the shorter version which is 15/27 possible points and assuming that the same percentage of points on the longer test indicates that you are an HSP). **If you are willing please take the test to see if you are an HSP and then fill out the poll below. Thank you.**

I am also going to post some research articles here for those of you who would like to learn more about HSPs and the research behind it (I am quoting from another post that I made about this):

""Hello everybody, I have recently been looking at various studies regarding HPSs. To be honest when I first heard about HSPs I thought that the idea was either a false pop psychology idea, or autism spectrum disorder or anxiety disguised under a fancy name. However, after reading the studies I will list below I am now convinced that sensory processing sensitivity (SPS) is real and that being an HSP is a unique, valid concept. I believe these studies are useful to get an in-depth understanding of what it truly means to be an HSP and they can also be useful to show that the idea of HSPs is valid. Here are the studies:

[The functional highly sensitive brain: a review of the brain circuits underlying sensory processing sensitivity and seemingly related disorders (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5832686/) (Discusses fMRI studies of SPS in comparison to autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, and post-traumatic stress disorder. This review shows that SPS is its own separate, unique trait and is different from the previously mentioned disorders)

[The highly sensitive brain: an fMRI study of sensory processing sensitivity and response to others' emotions - PubMed (nih.gov)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25161824/) (Provides evidence that higher HSP scores are correlated with ‚Äústronger activation of brain regions involved in awareness, empathy, and self-other processing‚Äù)

[The trait of sensory processing sensitivity and neural responses to changes in visual scenes (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3023077/) (‚ÄúSPS was associated with significantly greater activation in brain areas involved in high-order visual processing (i.e. right claustrum, left occipitotemporal, bilateral temporal and medial and posterior parietal regions) as well as in the right cerebellum, when detecting minor (*vs* major) changes in stimuli.‚Äù)

[Sensory Processing Sensitivity Predicts Individual Differences in Resting-State Functional Connectivity Associated with Depth of Processing - PubMed (nih.gov)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33561863/) (‚ÄúThe present study showed that SPS is associated with \[resting-state\] brain connectivity implicated in attentional control, consolidation of memory, physiological homeostasis, and deliberative cognition. These results support theories proposing ""depth of processing"" as a central feature of SPS and highlight the neural processes underlying this cardinal feature of the trait.‚Äù)

[Higher sensory processing sensitivity, introversion and ectomorphism: New biomarkers for human creativity in developing rural areas (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3409988/) (Discusses various aspects of SPS such as its involvement in creativity and also its presence in animals)

[Temperament trait of sensory processing sensitivity moderates cultural differences in neural response (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2894664/) (‚ÄúHere, 10 European-Americans and 10 East Asians underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing simple visuospatial tasks emphasizing judgments that were either context independent (typically easier for Americans) or context dependent (typically easier for Asians). As reported elsewhere, each group exhibited greater activation for the culturally non-preferred task in frontal and parietal regions associated with greater effort in attention and working memory. However, further analyses, reported here for the first time, provided preliminary support for moderation by SPS. Consistent with the careful-processing theory, high-SPS individuals showed little cultural difference; low-SPS, strong culture differences.‚Äù)

[A psychometric evaluation of the Highly Sensitive Person Scale: The components of sensory-processing sensitivity and their relation to the BIS/BAS and ‚ÄúBig Five‚Äù - ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886905003909) (‚ÄúResults demonstrate that the HSPS is a valid and reliable measure of the construct of SPS. However, in contrast to Aron and Aron‚Äôs finding that the scale is unidimensional, the current results support a three-component structure consisting of Aesthetic Sensitivity (AES), Low Sensory Threshold (LST), and Ease of Excitation (EOE).‚Äù ‚ÄúAES showed the strongest relation with Openness to Experience, while LST and EOE were found to be most closely associated with Neuroticism.‚Äù Unfortunately, this study is not free access, but if you are a student or faculty at a school you might be able to get access to the full text through your institution.)

[The relationships between sensory processing sensitivity, alexithymia, autism, depression, and anxiety - ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886908001281) (‚ÄúThe goal of the current investigation was to better understand the relationships between the three recently-developed factors of sensory processing sensitivity (ease of excitation ‚Äì EOE, low sensory threshold ‚Äì LST, and aesthetic sensitivity ‚Äì AES) and alexithymia, autism symptoms, anxiety, and depression. Two hundred and one college students completed the highly sensitive person scale, as well as measures of anxiety, depression, alexithymia, and autism symptoms. EOE and LST were related to autism symptoms, alexithymia, anxiety, and depression. AES was related to attention to details (a symptom of autism) and anxiety but not to depression. It was also negatively related to externally-oriented thinking (a symptom of alexithymia). Results indicate that AES is conceptually distinct from LST and EOE. Furthermore, EOE interacted with difficulty identifying feelings in predicting anxiety, indicating that being both easily excited by stimuli and unable to identify one‚Äôs feelings is particularly anxiety provoking.‚Äù)

[A psychometric evaluation of the Highly Sensitive Person Scale in ethnically and culturally heterogeneous South African samples | SpringerLink](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12144-020-00988-7) (The HSPS scale was tested for cross-cultural reliability via administration of the test to a group of students from a South African university. The HSPS scale was found to be reliable in this study and ‚ÄúFactor analysis revealed a novel five-factor solution (Negative Affect, Neural Sensitivity, Propensity to Overwhelm, Careful Processing and Aesthetic Sensitivity). As per previous reports, latent class analysis suggested a three class solution.‚Äù The study also discusses some weaknesses of the HSPS scale that could be improved such as the lack of reverse-coding in the assessment to address agreeability bias (i.e. reversing statements to make them negative). For example, I avoid violent movies could be easily reverse coded by switching the wording to I enjoy violent movies, but the original scale does not do this for any of the questions.)

[Dandelions, tulips and orchids: evidence for the existence of low-sensitive, medium-sensitive and high-sensitive individuals - PubMed (nih.gov)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29353876/) (‚ÄúWhile we were able to identify a highly sensitive (orchids, 31%) and a low-sensitive group (dandelions, 29%), we also detected a third group (40%) characterised by medium sensitivity, which we refer to as tulips in keeping with the flower metaphor.‚Äù ‚Äúthe three groups differed in neuroticism, extraversion and emotional reactivity to positive mood induction with orchids scoring significantly higher in neuroticism and emotional reactivity and lower in extraversion than the other two groups (dandelions also differed significantly from tulips).‚Äù ‚Äú**Findings suggest that environmental sensitivity is a continuous and normally distributed trait** but that people fall into three distinct sensitive groups along a sensitivity continuum.‚Äù)

[Sensory Processing Sensitivity and its association with personality traits and affect: A meta-analysis - ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0092656619300583) (‚ÄúSPS in children correlated with Neuroticism (*r‚ÄØ=*‚ÄØ0.42) but did not with Extraversion, Openness, Agreeableness or Conscientiousness. In adults, SPS correlated with Openness (*r‚ÄØ=*‚ÄØ0.14) and Neuroticism (*r‚ÄØ=*‚ÄØ0.40) but did not with Extraversion, Agreeableness or Conscientiousness.‚Äù Again, like the previous study the full text of this study is sadly unavailable for free.)

[The Role of Attachment Insecurity and Big Five Traits on Sensory Processing Sensitivity - PubMed (nih.gov)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30321115/) (‚ÄúAttachment avoidance, but not attachment anxiety, moderated the effect of BIS activity on SPS indicating that, compared to those with high BIS sensitivity, those with low levels of both BIS and attachment avoidance reported lower level of SPS. Attachment anxiety, neuroticism, extraversion, and openness partially mediated the effects of BIS on SPS.‚Äù You can read more about attachment theory here: [Attachment theory - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_theory).)

[Sensory Processing Sensitivity in the context of Environmental Sensitivity: A critical review and development of research agenda - ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763418306250) (‚ÄúWe conclude that SPS increases risk for stress-related problems in response to negative environments, but also provides greater benefit from positive and supportive experiences.‚Äù)

[The moderating role of sensory processing sensitivity in the link between stress and depression: A VBM study - PubMed (nih.gov)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33276034/) (‚ÄúBehavioral results showed that, compared with individuals low in EOE (i.e., ease of excitation, a sub-dimension of SPS), those high in EOE were more likely to report depressive symptoms under stress.‚Äù SPS can predispose people to depression under stressful conditions.)

isfj,"Most of the time I (INFP) just listen and never actively ask for clarification, or actually approach people in any way. I guess some people (especially feeling types) feel safe around people who act that way and sometimes start talking about things they care about. In those situations I try to understand as much as I can, and provide affirmation without being invasive or unnecesarily enthusiastic (some people are very sensitive about stuff they really think is important, and I know it is hard to open up, so I refrain from making comments that might 'shake' something that is barely standing), and try to speak out only when I'm pretty sure some comment will be liberating or useful.

With some people this is easier. For instance, an ENTJ friend was very anxious about grades, her finals, and a very competitive classmate was getting on her nerves, and I tried to be super kind with direct affirmation, and joked a bit, etc, and it was a very spontaneous and natural process.

But with ISFJs or INFJs I always have a lot of trouble. My brother (ISFJ) is very closed off, and while I try to be supportive of him, it is very hard without knowing what his actual concerns are. To make things worse, he has this signature ISFJ perfectionism, and I can tell he wouldn't like it if I made any sort of positive comment on anything he does, or thinks, or feels (when he moved out he left behind an extremely delicate and precise old-fashioned battleship assembled from tiny hand-painted cardboard pieces that is almost one meter long, and I often find myself looking at it and thinking that's pretty much the way he is. He does everything perfectly in absolute silence. And never explains any of his choices). I get the impression that any question or comment is some kind of recrimination for him. So I just try to hang around, but it makes me super sad. I respect him a lot, and I don't expect him to act any differently. But, judging from his instagram posts, he feels extremely lonely, and I think that something you guys/gals suffer a lot from.

isfj,"Dear ISFJs, I need your insight in a sort of self conflict (currently 25 yo male typing as ISFJ 6w5).

I've always felt like being between ISFJ and ISTJ and I just can't really figure it out despite the description of the functions.

1st case : I'm taking coffee with 3 colleagues. One of them talks about his issue with the timing belt of his motorbike and I ask him if it's a 2-stroke or 4-stroke engine to prepare some shitty joke about him making a valves salad if the belt was broken. It ended with me nerding and trying to explain to him what does the timing in an engine because he didn't knew about it.

2nd case : My parents aren't really good with computers and they don't want to. They had an old Windows 7 with a HDD who was going over its 10 years and was getting pretty slow. I replaced it by a SSD and updated it to Windows 10. The fact is, I feel that I've done it so I would stop hearing them complaining and not really because I wanted to do it for them (like being selfish). I've never felt really close to my parents (not really discussing about anything other than school and work).

3rd case : I work as IT technician for the moment (I have a master degree but the job I have is a good middle ground between wage, not having too many fees and having free time for the moment). I have a tendency to get some sort of dark anger when I hear my colleagues being kind of falsely blocked (because someone doesn't answer them by mails, but haven't tried to call them by phone and doing this again and again despite being here for at least 1 year) or being kind of chickened about not having the procedure to setup any production software and so they keep the tickets/subjects open for weeks sometimes (while sometime, you just have to do next next next). I generally don't say anything and tend to keep and internalize everything to continue my tasks.

4th case : Right now, I've taken something like 15 minutes to check my whole post so it would be at least understandable and not looking like someone who is too neglected.

And we haven't kissed yet. I believe she is not completely sure if she wants to have a relationship, but she is very warm.   


I like her, so my first thought was to give her a gift. However, do you think she can see it as if I am rushing everything? Like I am afraid to spook her.   


At the same time I'm afraid if I don't give a gift she will think I'm afraid of commitment.

isfj,"Hello, I'm an intj male, and as per stereotypes, was too reserved and blunt, sometimes unintentionally mean to my ex gf to the point she blew up and left me. We had a long term relationship that aside from my occasional bluntness and inconsistent emotional reassuring, was great. I always tried to make up for my emotional lacking with actions to show my love and devotion. Unfortunately that didn't make up enough.

My minor snips were due to stress and my own hard time of understanding my emotions in the moment. This is something I want to remedy in myself and make up to her. 
I never meant to hurt her, she means everything to me, and that says a lot since I often go months without even talking to my best friend. 

I can read her like a book and know that I made her the happiest she's ever been, I know she's very conflicted about leaving me, I know she still cares and misses me, but she's staying firm to her decision. 
We've talked a fair bit about the breakup and each other, I've even had the chance to hug her, kiss her forehead and caress her face. I watched the pain and fear melt away as I did so, I could see it in her eyes and body language. But still to no avail.. and then she's cold when not in person. I'm even restricted on fb. 

I dont know what to do, I don't know what to think. I know individuals will vary vastly, and from everything I've read about isfj is once they get to the point of blowing up its usually game over...  but the mixed signals are so confusing.

All I want is for her to give me the chance to prove I can grow and be better. I've never met a more genuinely kind, beautiful and loyal person. I was amazed how well we connected despite how opposite we are with emotions.

Whilst he makes fun of Chiron, there is a scene in the film in which Chiron catches Terrell staring at him in the classroom - his stare appears to be one of infatuation (he looks Chiron up and down, checking him out. It is clearly not a stare of contempt and the camera lingers on him too long for it to not mean something...) He seems to be particularly focused on Chiron, even following him home from school at one point with his friend (to tease him, yes, but why spend so much on time on one person? And some of the comments he makes seem a bit suggestive (""Now I ain't with that gay shit, but if you fuck with me, I'll give your ass more than you can handle,"" ""Why yo jeans so tight? His nuts must be choking in them I swear...,"")

In conclusion, my theory is that Chiron's bully from ""Moonlight"" was in the closet and actually had a thing for him.

isfj,"I'm mostly looking for feedback/similar experiences for this post.

I'm a 17-year-old guy, and I've recently found out that I'm an ISFJ. At first, when reading 16personalities description, it kind of nailed my personality (for the most part) and explained why some things in my life have gone the way they've gone.

Anyways, to be blunt, girls have always found me very attractive. Obviously, this sounds extremely douchey, but it's the truth. However, I absolutely fucking despise being the center of attention, and always hated when girls would give me the amount of attention they did. I was always shy growing up, didn't have much self-confidence, and I still don't. One would think, given my apparent ""good looks,"" that I would thrive? Wrong. I've had three girlfriends in which they were all long-term, while the more popular option for my age group would be to partake in the prevalent ""hook-up culture.""

Now, this brings me to my point. Normally, any guy would take the opportunity to have a few hookups with girls that were interested. For me, I can't tell if I'm either too shy/scared to do random hookups, or if I genuinely don't have a desire to? 

Does anyone else just not have a strong desire to hook up with girls just like that? People have always shamed me for passing up opportunities when realistically I look past the looks of a person and ultimately am attracted by the content of their character? Man, it makes me feel like a damn outcast.

Also, does anyone struggle with confidence? Reading about ISFJ males kind of put me down, as preferably, I would like to be seen as ""alpha"" or whatever. I know I can't do anything about it, and I also know that we possess qualities that I know other people desire. I guess my final question would be, given our MBTI type, can we actively work toward/progress toward a different one? Can our qualities change, say the I for introvert changes to a E? Since im young, I feel like I have a little bit more character development.. who knows.

Sorry for the long post, sounds like I need a fuckin therapist or something.",1614287005

isfj,"Meeting new people and making friends is a draining experience that I often face with a sense of reluctance and displeasure. This is not so much the social interaction itself (although that is also a considerable challenge), but rather the processes and outcome of creating relationships.

Expanding on the prospect of meeting people and making friends, such thoughts evoke various negative emotions. Firstly reluctance, followed by frustration, anger, and then weariness. These feelings originate, I think, from a lack of emotional energy to develop and maintain relationships. This includes keeping up with events and interests of the other person, birthdays, and generally maintaining some form of connection (it is not uncommon for me completely neglect meeting up with or talking with friends for days to weeks at a time). 

My desire is to be totally focused and committed to the relationships I already have. Naturally, this results in a *very* small number of relationships (one or two in my estimation). In other words, I don‚Äôt want to make new friends because, I cannot keep up with the ones I have already. However, I realised this is not very healthy and unrealistic, since social interaction and developing a network of friends and associates is important for many reasons. 

Another challenge involved with meeting people and making new friends is managing multiple friendship groups. This is aspect of relationships is particularly tough for me. Just dealing with different references, interests, hobbies, and group dynamics is unpleasurable.

What I have gathered from this is that I probably need shift my frame of mind towards meeting people and making new friends.

She copies me over text a lot- I send a heart and she sends one back usually

She agreed to make a Valentine's day card for me and I made one for her. It was my idea but hers was super cute

In the Valentine's card she used a bunch of  premade fandom cards, and one said ""you're bea-TEA-ful."" She seemed to really stress that the character was complimenting me and not her? That just seemed like a gay panic moment to be honest! Or it could be clarifying that she wasn't interested in me. It could honestly go either way. 

She said I was super pretty

She keeps telling me ""so and so- because I'm a lesbian"" - But gay people litterally announce they are gay all of the time, I know I did at her age, so that could mean nothing! 

She says she feels like she's known me for a long time

She says how grateful she is for me



What makes me worry is like- we still call each other ""good friends"", and I know this is a really common lesbian thing to take it slow. It doesn't help that we are also demisexual. On top of being gay, we take our time to get to know someone. 

Part of my wants to test her and ask if she has a crush on anyone, but I really don't want to lose our friendship if she gets the hint and doesn't feel the same. She's been like a ray of sunshine through the clouds in this pandemic for me. We met online like 8 months ago? It wasn't on a dating site and I know she's not a catfish.

Any advice/wisdom from fellow ISFJ's?",1613417672

isfj,"I asked this question earlier but it was so early in the morning so I only got one answer and was hoping to hear from other ISFJ males or females.

I am ENFJ girl crushing on an ISFJ male.

We have been friends for a long time, and I recently started to like him. We had a falling out because I was confused by his friendship towards me (you guys are nice to everyone). When we made up as friends after the falling out, I mentioned how I did have feelings for him in the past, hence why I stopped talking to him after our falling out. I also told him to watch the way he treats girls because his kindness could be interpreted as more.

He told me that he respects me for telling him about my feelings towards him. I interpreted that as he doesn't like me since he didn't say he liked me back. So this whole time he did just see me a friend I guess.

Anyways after we made up as friends, he became even more nicer than before. He opens up to me about stuff and asks me for my perspective. He tells me that he is there if I need to talk to him when I go through things. We have had phone conversations lasting an hour. He once called me on the phone after I congratulated him on something through text, telling me how much he appreciates me as a friend. He also told me that our friendship impacted him the most and he is grateful for me. So sweet of him.

My thing is, if you don't like someone and they tell you that they used to like you, wouldn't you be careful to not lead her on? Especially if the person expressed how you have to be careful how treat girls who may interpret it as more? What would make you act extra nice and sweet to a girl who used to like you? Ofcourse I still like him, but he doesn't know that. 

Is it just how you are as ISFJ's or could it mean more?

Also, please how would a girl know you like them since you treat everyone the same? Especially now with this pandemic and not being able to meet up. How would one know virtually lol?",1613399903

Basically I was wondering were we stood as friends. You ISFJ's are nice and friendly to everyone, so I assumed him and I were friends.

However, he never initiated texts or hangouts and only was friendly and nice when we hung in groups. So I confronted him about that. Anyways, he apologized for the mean things he said to me and during that time I told him how I did have feelings for him in the past that I needed to get 
over and didn't expect him to return my feelings. I also said that he had to watch the way he acted around girls because his friendliness may be perceived as more. You ISFJ' are just to charming,sweet and nice.

Anyways after we talked things out, our friendship became stronger. He is more nice to me and once called me to tell me how much he appreciates me as a friend and how much our friendship impacted his life. He also lets me know that he there for me when I go through things.

My question is, is he just being nice again? I still like him but want to protect myself because I know you guys tend to be sweet and nice. Would you still be nice and sweet to a girl after knowing she did have feelings for you in past or would you be extra careful to not hurt her?

However, they notice that now that they are muted, both boys are unmuted and talk to each other abt which song to choose/their classes/general stuff (the boys essentially j talk to each other now that the girl is muted.)

She does sit through it but feels angry, that the boys j wanted to chat w each other, that they are making the org+club involvement exclusive to themselves even though she did a lot of work, unwanted... by the time that 15 minutes have passed she is very upset, though she still does not say anything, and even though she understands that they need to prep for the meeting, she feels strongly unwanted and that they j want to be by themselves... and so, although she wouldn't normally, she leaves the meeting abruptly, almost impulsively, without notice 15 minutes in, as they are j talking to each other while she has been on mute for most of the time.

She feels weird abt it and knows that it will cause a rift but cries to herself, vents to friends some more, and doesn't re-join the meeting. She admits to one of the boys when he messages her that she felt unwanted/disliked, and is generally a lot more quiet in meetings w them moving forward (tho she is touched by the boy apologizing/clearing things up)

I (21F) have this ISFJ guy friend (21M) who I have liked for a while. We were acquaintances for a long time but have gradually grown closer and it feels like we‚Äôre a little more than friends. That said, we‚Äôve never discussed our feelings for each other. He is not very expressive (maybe this is typical ISFJ, I don‚Äôt know) but he would do anything for me and has done so plenty of times.

A few months ago he began texting me here and there, which I basically clung to as the one definitive sign he might actually like me, since he rarely texts anyone unnecessarily. We have a mutual friend group and see each other several times a week, but we gradually began texting every day. I floated the idea of hanging out with him a few times, but he never took me up on the offers. He will offer to come over and help me with things, but never just to ‚Äúhang out‚Äù, which makes me think I‚Äôm misreading the whole situation.

Anyways I went on a short vacation (COVID-safe) recently and my replies to him dwindled somewhat because I had limited cell reception. He started texting me multiple times a day, even when I hadn‚Äôt replied. I actually got a little annoyed because he‚Äôd never acted this way before. He even called me a couple times to say hi, which was new, so I expected him to make a move once I was back from vacation‚Ä¶but when I got back, our communication went back to normal. A mutual friend told me that he said he liked me whilst I was away, so I don‚Äôt understand why he hasn‚Äôt said anything to me. It makes me hesitant to approach him about it because if he wanted to date me, wouldn‚Äôt he have done it already?

I don‚Äôt know what to think but we seem too well-matched to let a potential relationship slip away. He is such a grounded, level-headed, calm person and makes me feel like I have a safe space to go back to, while my spontaneous, energetic self pushes him to try new things.

isfj,"Hello fellow ISFJs

I've just become conscious of how my Ne inferior is honestly just terrified of moving out. I live between two cities, one where my family lives and the other where I moved out in a shared apartement.

I just woke up and since I started to think about going back there. My Ne started to do 1000 conclusions and why it's not safe to go there. I've been bullied in my childhood and I normally mistrust people that I don't know very well. I have to know them better, before I start to open up and loose myself down.

So my Ne starts to make conclusions about how it is not safe. I start to think how they will judge me, make fun of me and I start to attack and devaluating myself like that I'm not worthy, that I'm a s\*itty person and that everyone hates me. I couldn't make a choice without thinking that it's unsafe for me.

It became really bad lately, where I couldn't control it anymore. This thoughts started to persist everywhere and I lost a ton of confidence. I've been prescribed with antidepressants because I felt low and unsafe all the time. I couldn't get out of my room without thinking of being judged by somebody. I didn't have the energy and motivation to do anything. Everything became useless and meaningless. 

Now that I'm home again, stayed a while and calmed down, I've noticed that only by the thought of going back there, all these uncertanties raise up again and honestly just destroy me. 

I already see a psychologist, where I can talk about these things out loud but it didn't calm the water. Though I've to say that I also quit my studies because I didn't like them, so when I go back there I don't have a lot to do other than cooking and sports. It means that I'm not occupied so my mind has a lot of time to wonder around. I will begin new studys next year and until then I will do few jobs, one that starts the end of the month. I'm sure that it will probably help me to calm down and find my place in the apartement...

&amp;#x200B;

Do you maybe have an idea on how to take things slowly? How to calm these Ne inferior assumptions and get clarity? I actually really loved the idea of studying and living out, but since I quit my studies it's like I've lost a crutch on which I supported myself.

Just by becoming conscious of it this morning will probably help a lot but I'm scared that it will happen again and that I won't be able to control it.

I have to get out of there. However, I want to do this the smart way and only quit when I got the other job lined up. Now, should I go the ""money route"" where I could potentially earn more (now or the future), or should I rather look out for a job with social impact? I think I would enjoy working for a company with values I share, however, money is important, especially when it comes to wanting a family, sooner or later. 

Are you able to think ""a job is just a job"" or ""it brings money home, that's what I care most"" or are you also driven by other factores like values or ethics? Thanks for answers.",1612897867

My ISFJ mom is probably 80% of the reason I‚Äôm a functioning adult today. To this day, she still helps me calm down and find the various items I absent-mindedly leave around my apartment (thanks, inferior Se üòÖ).

Now you may think ‚Äùthen you‚Äôre obviously extroverted‚Äù, but the thing is that I prefer quieter environments. Few things anger me more than noise, for example a TV or people talking in the background when I‚Äôm trying to study. At first I thought no one liked noise when concentrating, but my dad who‚Äôs an extrovert said he likes a little noise and used to go to a caf√© to study... something I never would do. Also I‚Äôve never liked to mingle, but I don‚Äôt really know if it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm introverted or just shy.

isfj,"Very green to all things reddit but here I am and I‚Äôm genuinely interested in understanding you lovely ISFJ men (yes, I‚Äôm aware these are generalizing categories and not all are the same). 

So this guy cannot stop stealing furtive glances from me and when he assumes that I can‚Äôt feel his admiring gaze on me, it lingers for even longer, until I meet his glare and he looks away very embarrassed. He gets nervous and squirmy when talking to me, which is all very endearing and flattering to be quite honest. He‚Äôs the classic ISFJ; emotionally intuitive and caring, always very honest and dependable and although he is a bit shy, he‚Äôs mostly extraordinarily reserved until he‚Äôs comfortable with his company. We haven‚Äôt reached this point yet, haha.. On the downside, I feel that he fears deeply being rejected or even placing himself in a slightly vulnerable position to feel the awkwardness of an exchange with me. He always makes himself available to me by placing himself physically in the same areas as me, and even adapts to my schedule to run into me at very specific times but he never approaches me. 

I have a feeling that he is quietly thrilled with my assertive side. And for the record, I *did* take the initiative a few times to show my appreciation for him, I texted him a few times and even called him cute - which I would never do to guys! üòÖ Under his surface, I can tell he boils with a want but doesn‚Äôt dare. I juuuuust want him to reciprocate a bit because I know he is intrigued by me but he seems terrified and his attempts to reciprocate are quite underwhelming.

This has gone on for nearly a year and so my question is, for all you ISFJ men who have a solid streak of reservation or shyness, what would push you to actually make a move - if anything? And would you really forego an opportunity to love someone just because of your personal restraint? 

Btw, I‚Äôm myself a female INFP:)",1612207157

We were put into another breakout room with a group of ppl yesterday, and I noticed that he stayed the full hour even though he didn't have to - he mentioned that he was willing to help out with problems bc he is good at math and it sounded a bit... brag-y? He stayed even though I was mostly asking the questions (though one other person did too,) and was the only person to say bye to me when I left.

Is he an oddly nice teenage boy? Does he have a thing for me? Does he want to be friends?

Even though this is a stereotype, I believe that it is true that we often accept what people say without questioning it. Our authorities in particular. This is because we're usually very meek and timid. I don't know about the rest of you, but that bad quality has definitely bit me in the rear. With that said, I'd like to give the rest of you a tip on how to develop our ENTP subconscious so it'll be much easier to defend yourself against this bad quality. The tip is this: Find a fictional character that acts a lot like an ENTP, and copy their behavior. Obviously don't go overboard when you do this, but this will definitely help you develop your ENTP subconscious! Personally, there's only one fictional character that I think acts a lot like an ENTP: Franklin ""Hawkeye"" Pierce from the old show MASH. I know it's an older show, but Hawkeye is a near perfect example of an ENTP in fiction. In my opinion at least. The show may be pretty old, but at least full episodes aren't that hard to find.",1611508699

First of all, Thank you to everyone who spent some time giving me their advice and insights.

After our second date she kept asking me to see each other. I wasn't on board 100%, but she was intriguing, the sex was insane, and honestly it was worth it to give it a shot and explore my feelings a bit better.

She came over to my house again and we immediately went to the bedroom. It was amazing, yet not enough for me.

Then it just kinda happened. We were naked on the bed and somehow the conversation turned really deep and personal. She opened up a lot about her past and we connected extremely well. I think at a certain point I rambled about the Universe for 30 minutes and, to my surprise, she actually listened to the whole thing.

I was really surprised and our bond started to grow on me.

We spent the whole week together, talking and constantly having sex.

I'm super glad that I gave it another chance. This is definitely a honeymoon phase, but a welcome one.

We'll see where this is going, but now I'm definitely positive that we are a match and there's a good chance for a great relationship.

Thank you all!",1611500771
isfj,"Inferior Ne is usually associated with a fear of the unknown but I think that people often interpret this fear differently compared to the way I as an Si dom see it so I started wondering if other SJs experience it the same way I do or if it's just me. I know that some of the things are probably just stereotypes that many people aren't going to relate to anyway but I'd still like to know the extent to which other Si doms commonly relate to it. 

People often seem to think that being ""afraid of the unknown"" results in not wanting to expose oneself to anything that goes beyond one's experiences or what they perceive to be true and that this encapsulates both new concrete experiences as well as unfamiliar concepts or ideas. This typically makes others think that we're close-minded, set in our ways or aren't able to change our opinion on something just because of the way it has been in the past. Sometimes people also assume that we're by default judgmental or ignorant towards the unknown too. 

Contrary to what one may think about inferior Intuition, the fear I experience related to unfamiliar things is usually just concerned with specific physical matters (like going to a place I've never been to and that I know is going to overwhelm me or something like that) but I still think that it's important to expose yourself to things like that even if it seems scary at first. On the other hand, I don't experience any fear related to abstract concepts and if I encounter something new in that area then I'm more likely to want to read up on it and just be interested in it. I've also noticed that while the fear in itself remains, the specific scenario that I used to be afraid of usually doesn't bother me as much anymore after I know what to expect (even if it might take a bit longer to do so depending on what it is).

So how does the fear of the unknown relate to or affect you?",1611478182

Back story: I introduced her and her fianc√© and have been through it ALL with them the last year. Trying to make everything as special as I can for them due to the Covid era. Came to our house several times so they could have dates..etc... Gave her a fantastic, small bridal shower etc... I realized they were taking too much of my energy with everything they were asking. Then her mom demanded I help with a Drive By Shower and I had to politely decline because I had no energy left to give. Since then I have just been kind of ‚Äúhandled‚Äù like I am a delicate butterfly and been talked to in a way that is patronizing.  Super weird.  Myself and the other bridesmaid had dresses we ordered for the wedding back in October.  There was going to be a very small (about 15 people) ceremony where we would wear masks and social distance.  I talk to the bride/friend just about everyday.  I say something about my dress needing to be altered about mid-November and she says ‚Äúoh yeah... I forgot to tell you.. we are just going to have our parents and no one else.‚Äù  I would have been fine with that but I seriously have a dress now that I am past the return date on.  I have been supporting her because I know getting married during this time is crazy and not as fun as they want it to be.  She has been sad because none of her ‚Äúgirls‚Äù are going to be with her and nothing is like she would want it.  Etc... I being the caring person I am, call the other ‚Äúbridesmaid‚Äù and say ‚Äúhey... what can we do to make this day special for her? Maybe drop something off... etc...‚Äù. She then tells me not to tell anyone but the bride asked her to be there so they are going to get ready together and make the day special for her.  I do recognize this is a good thing, but in a way it feels hurtful. At the same time, even if she asked me, I wouldn‚Äôt want to be there because it‚Äôs just been so weird since I stood up for myself about the drive thru shower thing and I am over all the drama.  Due to some unfortunate circumstances my wedding was kind of awful and lonely.  I had no friends or family there and it was really tough.  I did get to marry an amazing man but it still kind of stings.  I just didn‚Äôt want her to feel that way so I have worked really hard on making her feel special.  I should be happy that it will all be over tomorrow but there is just something really weighing on me.  It feels so stupid to feel hurt.  I know I shouldn‚Äôt even care.

isfj,"Hello! My first reddit post:

Recently did a personality test to find out more about myself. Tested myself 4 times and ended up with ESTJ/ENTJ (3/1 times). So I think I would consider myself as an ESTJ (Maybe, LOL). Currently working as a supervisor. 26, single for almost 4-5 years. Apologies for my writing as English is my 2nd language.

Matched with a girl on Tinder with no bio written, just with a few tags and 2 blurry-ish selfies. Was probably bored that day and decided to initiate conversation. Had a few exchanges for roughly 5 days and she mostly replied with one-liners. I decided to ask whether she is interested to have a brunch together on weekend. Asked for another way to contact her instead of using tinder and she gave me her number.

Time skip. Texted her in early morning where we should meet up, arrived the venue first to try to ""scout out"" the place and look for her \[Trying my best to recognise her facial features based on her selfie on tinder\]. 10mins passed, got a text from her that she would be late and suddenly she just appeared out of no way. We greeted each other (She looks way prettier in person) and she just zoomed to a nearby drink stall to get her drink. Time skip again&gt; we went to grab some food and found ourselves a table. We were chatting and trying to get to know more about each other. She laughed quite a bit during our conversation. During our chat, she started twirling her hair, playing her jewelleries, picking on her food, etc \[I immediately took that as a sign of nervousness\]. I tried to initiate most of the conversation carefully as I don't want to scare her and she managed very well. We went to the mall to do some shopping then later a final drink before it was time for us to head back. Along the way to mall and having the final drink, she was kinda ""clumsy"" and bumping into me quite often which I find it funny (In a good way). Called an uber for her and waited with her. While waiting, my mind started to analyse the time we had. I told myself that she is shy, quiet type and started to plan for the potential 2nd date with activities that she might like (She didn't talk much about her hobbies/interests even though I asked her). When the uber arrived, she said thank you for the awesome time together and initiated a hug which took me by surprise.

Got back and texted her that I really enjoyed the time together and she replied with the same answer. I decided to ask for her personality and told her just do the test for fun \[even though I am very interested to know\]. She said she would do it straight away. Didn't receive a reply from her for like 2 hours and I thought she probably fell asleep. It was quite late so I decided to call it and send my personality (ESTJ) to her and just go to bed. Right after I sent it, I got a text from her saying she got ISFJ. I was like:""Huh, interesting..."". I told her to call it a day as it was very late and I would get back to her the next morning. LOL, stayed up all night to do some reading about ISFJ.

I would say I am the type of person that won't be investing much time and energy if I don't have any interest for the other person. But for this particular girl I met, I do want to invest almost everything onto her. Based on the info I got, ISFJ are kind hearted people, always willing to give, hardworking, hates ""just go with the flow"" schedule, shy, not ""willing"" to show/express their emotions, etc. After a few days of texting, she said she wanted more friends to hang out with \[which kinda destroyed my purpose of hanging out with her as I'm looking for potential partner, not friends\]. Exchanged with a few laughing emojis and texts then in my mind, I was like:"" yeahhh screw it, let's try it again, imma ask her out again and see how it goes"". Asked her out for a bowling date next week and she accepted it and said she likes bowling too. The thing is that I will never hang out alone with a girl even she is a good friend of mine. When she agreed to meet up again, I got a bit confused.

So I would like to ask my fellow ISFJ peeps. Do you guys actually just enjoy hanging out with people that you are comfortable with? Do you guys willing to just go out with a stranger again that you only met for like a few hours? I did more reading on ISFJ type and apparently ISFJ type do not open up that easily as well as prefer straightforward answers. I'm worried if I tell her that I'm looking for a potential partner not just a friend might scare her off or something even though she texted that she wouldn't mind hanging out with me as she wants more friend. Do you fellow ISFJ think there might be potential for this match? **So sorry for the long post!**

P/S: She recently moved to my town so she is fairly new here. I think she actually just wants more friends to hang out. Just want some feedback/inputs from my fellow ISFJ whether this might work for us.

Momo ISFJ - Boku No Hero Academia Myers-Briggs Types

Wanted to of course see what the ISFJs thought of this one.

Ok in my opinion this post is long overdue. After years of analyzing her and this show and its characters and from discussing online with other people, I'm almost certain she's ISFJ. And from the very least I always knew she was a Si dom and Si user in my opinion. Let me explain why she's a ISFJ and Si dom user to in this post.

Momo is a calm and introverted person and one of the most level headed people and students in class 1-A. Momo is driven by duty and security, she cares a lot about rules, safety, tradition, security and is always remembering past details and is a very responsible person. Back in the day I mistyped her ISTJ just because of the know it all rule obsessed girl stereotype and wanting to be class rep and so on thing too air she had and wanted. Stereotyping her and other types was wrong of me back then and after discussing online and observing her character I've realized she's ISFJ not ISTJ. She's usually nowadays typed ISFJ correctly, but frustratingly she gets mistyped INFJ sometimes online when she's the furthest from ever being a Ni user at all, and she's definitely not a INTJ either like Todoroki. Momo is a Si dom and Ne inferior user, security, past details, comparing and contrasting things, duty, honor and tradition and rules are everything to her. She wants people to follow rules and do things the old way in a orderly fashion similar to Iida a ESTJ and uses her Si quite often in the series, she's a very by the books character. Her Si is clear in the show.

Now onto her Fe, again she comes off as tough in the beginning and logical at first which makes you think Te initially and I thought this too for awhile. But no when you look deeper she's very emotional in a feeler way of course, always thinking about the group and society as a whole and picks up on peoples feelings outside her own with her Fe quite often in the series. She's very analytical with both her Si and Ti as well, she cares about truth and logical accuracy and can break down a situation and see inconsistencies with her Ti very easily and loves figuring out how things work, Ti. Her power of creation is perfect for her low Ne as well and helps her be creative with ideas and works hand in hand with her Ti seeing intricacies and noticing logical details to help exploit her ideas creatively in tough situations, and her Si helps to with being detail oriented, organized and pay close attention to things. She can be a little to cocky in her abilities and traditional and think just based on her base understanding of past actions and ways someone is with herself or opponent that she'll win something every time until she learns from actual experience that everything doesn't go as she plans in fights and rough situations and she should be open to new experiences and surprises at a moments from someone or something.

She's getting better at it and working on accepting new possibilities in life which is her weakness as a Ne inferior user and doesn't overly rely only on her Si as much as she used too and also trusts and relies on others abilities more. Her more mature attitude and open mindedness even more than before helps her Fe flourish and give orders and focus on everybody's needs and see their strengths both emotionally and logically in situations and she always puts the groups needs first in situations and is good at directing others on what to do and how to do it and is always being emotionally supportive asking if there all right in most rough situations, she's also a very sensitive and caring nurturing person inside and of course a very calm and introverted girl as well and very level headed. Momo Yaoyorozu is a ISFJ girl and Si dom user and Ne inferior user and uses Ti and Fe aux in her life and behavior as well, hope this helped and helped you see why.

He gets more frustrated when I point out that feelings are not thoughts. I could use some guidance. Is this a typical response from someone who uses their feelings as a guide? Is it someone who doesn't understand the difference between their thoughts and their feelings? Is it a teenage thing? How can I best communicate that I'm trying to help but I first need to understand what they're thinking without getting hostility? 

For instance: he will be trying to figure something out, and I try to help. He is very resistant to help, just wants me to do all of the thinking for him and tell him exactly what to do... but I want to walk him through it so that he can develop and learn how to solve problems on his own. I don't think that's a type thing, I think that's an age thing. However, in order to walk him through that, I need to understand how the problem looks in his mind which is always very different from how it looks to me and I can't get that from him if all he tells me is how he feels instead of what he thinks. Nor can I help him if he thinks feeling frustrated is license to give up. 

I'm a bit delicate about this honestly and not very experienced with teens, grasping at straws, any advice would help.",1611016183

isfj,"Hi everyone!

A week ago I met this ISFJ on Tinder. She was beautiful to me and in a very blunt way I just told her as an opening line.

She appreciated it and we started a conversation. Messages were quite sparse and superficial. She didn't replay for a couple of days and then came back saying she was sorry and invited me for a coffee.

At this point I'm already confused, we really didn't talk about anything substantial and to me was totally fine if she stopped replying. It's quite common on Tinder and that's ok.

I agree to the coffee and we meet the next day for a couple of hours. It was fine. I felt a strong sexual attraction even though the conversation was still quite superficial.

I kinda told her how I perceived her personality and apparently she really appreciated my comments and she felt understood.

In all of this I'm still not quite sure about what is going, but at the end of the date I told her I would like to see her again.

As a second date, she came to my house the very next day. We cooked something together and then moved directly to the bedroom and had pretty good sex for a couple of hours.

I know it sounds weird, but I was super confused throughout everything. All of our conversations were still pretty dry and superficial. I constantly had this feeling that she was embarassed / didn't really feel comfortable with me. Then we moved onto the sex and we both enjoyed it.

We kissed goodbye and I have no idea what I'm doing and what is going on.

Through text she's super shy and basically cuts me off immediately (which is ok, I don't like texting about nothing too much).

She's super kind in everything she does. That is incredibly impressive to me and probably the most attractive thing I found in her.

At the same time she feels reeeeally distant and I don't think we have that great of a connection.

I've never been so confused. She basically did everything and I just played along. I don't even understand if I like her or not.

Could you please help me figure out this behaviour?
What should I do?

I honestly would like to get to know her a bit better and explore my feelings, but texting her feels so weird and uncomfortable.",1610974294

isfj,"As per request, I‚Äôm making this post for the one ISFJ that requested it, but I‚Äôm hoping this will help more than one individual.

First and foremost, thank you for being you. This world needs more gentle and thoughtful souls like you. 

However, I‚Äôve noticed that many ISFJs have difficulties with being assertive, knowing when to say no, and not feeling confident. And that‚Äôs what this post will address.

A quick summary about who I am. I‚Äôm a successful entrepreneur in my late twenties who is currently serving in the United States Marines. My personality is ENTJ, and my enneagram personality is an 8 (go figure). In previous endeavors, I ran my own confidence coaching business for men, and I‚Äôve written articles for small self improvement companies. I‚Äôm currently working on a dating app project. 

Onto the meat of this post...

A lack of confidence stems from lack of success. Winning breeds more winning. One small win will lead to more, and so forth. So the issue does not stem from a lack of confidence, but rather a lack in the *belief* that you can win. In other words, there‚Äôs a mental barrier that cannot be convinced until there is physical proof that you can win...which requires you to win. Seems like a catch-22, but here‚Äôs how you start:

If you want to feel more confident, you have to find a near impossible challenge, and *give it absolutely everything you have* in order to win. 

Usually, that‚Äôs enough. You might fail the first few times, but with enough time and resources, anything is accomplishable. 

Assertiveness: the ability to enforce your own thoughts and boundaries and bending the world around you to your will. 

In my early teenage years, this was an issue for me. Believe it or not, I was actually bullied a little. Not so much that it affected me, but enough that I remember. As I kept getting continually pushed around in a few areas of my life later on, I remember getting extremely furious, and that was the day I found self respect. From there, saying ‚Äúno‚Äù and taking care of my needs first became easier. 

One of the best teachers of self respect is experience. I could sit here and *tell* you why I believe your thoughts and feelings are just as valid as that of others, but until someone does something truly horrible to you, like cheat on you, your boss firing you after you‚Äôve done so much for them, or beaten to near death over your wallet, you won‚Äôt turn inwards to the beautiful soul that lies within. You won‚Äôt understand that you yourself are just as important as the ones you take care. 

And how do I know this? Because I went through that pain. I went through it all. Even more so during marine corps boot camp. 

My words might not trump experience. But perhaps the following question will reveal that truth. Most of us can agree how valuable and precious children are. They are, as they say, ‚Äúthe future‚Äù - But at what point does any child or their needs become insignificant? 

If you answered ‚Äúnever‚Äù, then let me remind you of one thing:

You were once that child, and you and your needs never stopped being important.

-Have a great week.",1610583592

I don't know if he actually likes me or he is just fooling around. I am ENFP (F, 20) and he is a ISTJ (M, 20) and this is the situation.

isfj,"Two days ago I went through a break up with the guy I‚Äôve been in love with for three years. First of all, we weren‚Äôt even an oficial couple, I‚Äôll share a bit of the story.

He is an INTP, we both met three year ago and we immediately developed a mutual crush, we started talking and making out when suddenly he became cold and distant, and surprise, he had a girlfriend who he shoved on my face meanwhile we were still making out. I‚Äôve never been so destroyed in my entire life. Somehow that wasn‚Äôt enough for me to stay away from him and we continue being friends.

He wasn‚Äôt very happy with his relationship but was faithful to her, yet he used me to get affection and an ego boost when he needed it, when they broke up, he came back to me saying that he was a fool because it took him too long to realized it was me the one he loved, by that time I was already with a partner and planning a trip to Europe with him. He still talked while I was in the trip, he was a little jealous saying things like ‚Äúoh you two will sleep in the same bed?‚Äù or ‚Äúnice picture, let me guess, he took it.‚Äù 

Sadly I was still too in love with INTP to continue my healthy and lovely relationship with the new guy, and I was so frustrated, because he was the sweetest guy I‚Äôve ever met, why can‚Äôt I love him like I love this guy that hurt me?

We broke up, and I started talking with INTP guy in a more than friends way again, but due to quarantine we had to wait like six months to see each other again. When we did it was the same, making out. Thing is I am really insecure, don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs for being an ISFJ but I need constant reassurance, and I was afraid that he would meet someone else again, he is very secretive and that didn‚Äôt give me much confidence either. I didn‚Äôt want to overwhelm him with my emotional needs so I tried to be cool and chilled for him but that‚Äôs not me, so I started showing him my insecure side, he started to become distant and cold, we saw each other one hour per day per week to make out and then he disappeared, no texts, nothing, a complete ghost. Two days ago when I ‚Äúconfronted‚Äù him by saying ‚Äúhey I feel you uninterested‚Äù he said ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt make you trust me‚Äù and he is right, so I decided to stop stealing his time, but I‚Äôm devastated.

isfj,"It says on the MBTI manual that ISTJ and ISFJ types (also ISFP and ISTP) are ""among types most likely to suffer heart disease and hypertension"" (at least I saw it in Truity and it was saying that the source was MBTI manual)

Maybe because the world is ever-changing and ISxJ types are the least likely to adapt to it and get stressed by the nature of the world so they have higher cortisol and cholesterol? Maybe Si-dom increases binge-eating or any other risk factor?

The opposite was said for types ENTP, INTJ, INFP and ENFP. (though for ENFP, only for females) Maybe they are the least neurotic out of all types but inferior Si protects you from heart disease?

isfj,"I have a good friend who is an ISFJ, F33. She currently works as a customer support rep for an evil health insurance company. The job pays well enough for her to support herself, but is incredibly demanding, draining, and the work itself is very unfulfilling. She‚Äôs regularly miserable and dreads having to start each Monday. Beyond that, she‚Äôs micromanaged and constantly pressured to do overtime. 

&amp;#x200B;

I can tell that the endless strain of it is taking a heavy toll on her, and that it is not going to be a long term solution as far as income. Originally she went to school for veterinary services, but left that field due to the pay not being high enough to support herself. Earlier this year she applied to Port Authority as a driver, but ultimately decided to decline due to the lower pay and inconsistent scheduling. She‚Äôd say it‚Äôs better to deal with the devil you know than the one you don‚Äôt. 

&amp;#x200B;

I‚Äôm hoping to help her brainstorm possible alternatives that better fit her values. She‚Äôs very outwardly caring and generous, but often overextends herself. She loves animals, crafts, and board games. She comes from an unstable family and has grown to be self-sufficient, but fears asking for help and burdening others. She has great social skills and writes eloquently, but gets burnt out from excessive small talk and commotion, typical of introverts.

She has a healthy social life and is well-liked by her peers, as she is funny and has good fashion sense/looks presentable (she does pay attention to other people, tends to gossip with friends but not unlikable.) She can be somewhat judgmental, though not to the extent her mother happens to be, and does quietly take notice of whether others take care of their appearance (largely due to her mother's influence.) She is skinny (she is naturally lucky in this regard, though her mother does encourage her to eat a bit more healthy than she does... she does make a conscious effort to stay in good physical shape, in part due to understanding that her sister is teased by some at school for being a tad bit overweight, though her sister carries the weight well.) She can tell based upon the way her sister interacts with her/how rude her sister is her to that her sister has some negative feelings toward her, though she cannot quite tell what is wrong (in part due to her young age, perhaps) - she sees that her sister is depressed and does feel bad for her, but is still upset about the way she is treated by her sister and does sometimes go to their mother crying about it after her sister makes a snarky comment. She definitely can be a tad bit bratty/whiney about certain things due to her mother spoiling her (though her mother honestly spoils her older sister somewhat too, even though this girl is the favorite child,) and does not have an issue with whining or crying to her mother about certain things (in fact, she honestly does half the time,) but will stop or avoid doing so if she sees that her mother is upset/that there is tension in the house and is generally still more obedient than her older sister.

But you guys are the true givers. The truly selfless ones. You‚Äôre the ones we look to when we‚Äôve failed for the 100th time.

isfj,"I was typed as definite ENFP but whenever I look at inferior functions, I deny it myself. It seems like instead of choosing what actually identifies with me the most, I choose the one that denies my typings.

I even deny it by ""I'm not an ENFP because I was in an undiscovered Ne grip (in ISJs) for 8 months when my classmate has known me for 8 months."" I know this is not very possible because I was feeling pretty good at those times.

And yes, I was typed by a classmate who is knowledgeable about MBTI and cognitive functions. I was even typed by cognitive functions. Anything other than Ne-dom was eliminated to the point of her being stunned when I claim that I'm not ENxP.

What are some signs that I'm not an ENFP?

HERE ARE MY REASONS:

INFP: I feel more like ENFP than INFP and inferior Si fits me better than inferior Te. But I still consider this because of my fear of being INFP stereotypes.

ESFP: Just inferior Ni reactions, not dominant Se.

ISxJ: ""Inferior Ne is common and boring so I must be that one as well"" mentality. Flashbacks can happen when I look at some objects. I get possibilities though.

ISxP: PoLR Ne doesn't fit me but why not? Maybe my Ne is Se-Ni!

isfj,"I‚Äôm an INFJ woman. I met this confirmed ISFJ a few months ago and she is totally kind and warm and insightful. We‚Äôre both in our 20s. I love chatting with her, I find her interesting, and we make good friends. She is caring, and I can feel that she always wants the best for me. (She even tells me that directly sometimes.)

But she‚Äòs a selectively bad listener, and more and more I find it unfulfilling. I can tell she‚Äôs very comfortable with me, she talks a lot when it‚Äôs just us and she has told me things she‚Äôs never told anyone else. She says she feels understood, and that she knew we would come to have a special connection from the moment she saw me.

Our friendship is special to me too but I don‚Äôt feel understood. I don‚Äôt even feel heard half the time. I wrote selective in the title, because sometimes she is receptive. She asks me about my problems if I seem sad or stressed that day, and she listens and gives me good advice. But when I talk about other stuff, it falls flat. A few times, I started to talk about my hobbies, my friends, and immediately she wasn‚Äôt interested, she seemed impatient even. She would either space out or keep checking her phone, which always makes me feel awkward so I just shut up and wonder if I‚Äôm being boring.

isfj,"I'll share a formal energetics assessment that I conducted on Donald Trump. And the personality profiling result is the following...

Donald Trump is a SEE/ESFP in reverse development with main enneagram 8w7. NiTe subego (channelling Ni inspirations with Te methodics) pushed by a submerged Se Base frame. Fi fixation.

IRL dimensionality of valued functions:4D Base: Se (submerged), 3D Primary Auxiliary: Te (surfacing), 2D Secondary Auxiliary: Ni (surfaced), 1D Acting Suggestive: Fi (submerging)

On practical terms the resulting behaviour is an hybrid between SEE/ESFP and LIE/ENTJ. His strong tendencies of shaming and guilting others are an unhealthy expression of Fe Demonstrative. On top of that he has NPD.

Reversion is often triggered by trauma, depression and/or drug abuse. I suspect that in the case of Trump it was the latter to trigger the above reversion.

If you think that you can just cage the fluidity of human psyche in 16 boxes of stereotypes with all people following the same specific steps in development... And call it a day... You're delusional and you're vastly understimating the human psyche.

The human psyche is much more fluid and vast than systems like MBTI and socionics think it to be.

I‚Äôve also posted a few times in r/MbtiTypeMe in the past (deleted most of the posts now) but usually get almost no responses :‚Äô) so thank you if you do end up reading everything.

- **How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.**

21F. As a kid I was much more outgoing, mischievous, and could get along with practically anyone regardless of background and personality. Then I went through a very depressing stage and entered high school a lot more reserved and taking myself much more seriously. Now that I‚Äôm a 3rd-year in college, I think I‚Äôve learned to be more social again, more mature in how I interact with other people, and not trying to hide my inner weirdness, playfulness, and sarcasm that I had as a kid when I get closer to others.

- **Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?**

No, but I suspect I have some moderate social anxiety.

- **Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?**

I grew up living in 3 diff places in the US (east/west coasts) and living with my extended family in Asia many summers. My household was Christian but my environment outside of that was very liberal. I grew up playing two instruments and doing two sports for 10 years, so I think my upbringing has made me more open-minded, in terms of embracing various values and hobbies.

- **What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?**

I‚Äôm currently studying electrical engineering. Took me quite a while to figure out what I want to do, but I really enjoy what I study, especially the math involved in my discipline. I think I‚Äôd like a job that has a more human and creative quality so I‚Äôm thinking of an engineering role in the biotechnology or health industry.

- **If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?**

I would be lonely if I was stuck in the house alone, but I could probably find something to do. If I could go out alone that would be refreshing, whether it‚Äôs just running errands or biking around and seeing other people pass by.

- **What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?**

I grew up doing two individual sports, swimming and taekwondo. I think the mastery was what I liked, I swam competitively for a while and earned a black belt in taekwondo. Taekwondo was sort of spiritual for me, if that makes sense, due to the development of mental mastery and self-discipline. Other than that, I enjoy activities like playing piano (calming) and reading novels.

- **How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?**

I like to have exposure to a lot of different subjects, so even if it means more work for me, I enjoy taking extra classes in college outside engineering, like epidemiology, plant biology, music, economics, communication, chemistry, comparative literature, atmospheric science, European history, and language.

- **Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?**

No, I only take the position if no one else does or is not participating in doing work. My ‚Äúleadership‚Äù style is treating everyone as equal, everyone‚Äôs ideas are welcome and the work is done as a team, where everyone can hopefully learn from each other and not just from one person.

- **Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.**

Nowadays, no. In the past I did graphic design and drawing; my teachers often told me my design ideas were very creative or witty (if it was commentary on an environmental problem), and that I have a great eye for color theory and combinations.

- **How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?**

Sometimes I‚Äôm annoyed if I‚Äôm ‚Äúin the zone‚Äù with my current activity, but other than that I would help if I had the ability to do so. It just feels good to help a stranger with something small; perhaps that feeling of transience of entering another‚Äôs life briefly before leaving again are those little moments that make me happy.

- **How important is efficiency and productivity to you?**

I am not efficient but I value productivity. If I don‚Äôt have anything to do, learn, or research, I will get bored very quickly. Productivity to me can be any small activity accomplished, not necessarily checking off a list or anything, just as long as I feel good about what I did that day.

- **What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?**

I like professors who are more structured/organized in their lectures because I drift off or get distracted easily by my own thoughts. I enjoy some aspects of lab work and discussion groups where we can talk the ideas out and solve problems together (unless the group dynamic is horrible). I dislike classes that just make us memorize a bunch of vocabulary or equations. Understanding derivations or how many factors affect a problem is fun.

- **How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?**

No strategies, I have a general idea of how a project may progress, but I leave it up in the air and change as I move along. I can‚Äôt do this so much in group work though, so I just see what my other teammates‚Äô styles are and adapt.

- **What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?**

I like science a lot, especially chemistry and physics, and human systems. Still not exactly sure of what to do career-wise.

- **How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?**

I tend to go on autopilot when doing some things, like walking to classes (before), getting ready in the morning for class, etc. I am attached to reality insomuch as what I can learn about it, either objectively (science) or through other people‚Äôs perspectives (reading). I can get attached to certain objects or sense of aesthetics because they either bear a specific value to me or I see how I can use them in the future (both literally and as inspiration).

- **Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?**

I would wonder if I got drugged and kidnapped and if there are hidden cameras and people are watching me and my next moves as an experiment. I might sing/hum songs and look at the room‚Äôs structure and imagine how it was built and what it would look like if I made changes to it, like a hidden passage.

- **How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?**

I dislike making important decisions for other people because I don‚Äôt like the commitment and being responsible for it. For myself I would research intensively to make the best decision in the end but I would probably end up doubting myself and revisit the problem.

- **How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?**

I used to be very immature with my emotions, like placing the blame on others, not being responsible for my own feelings, or just having very negative feelings towards everything/everyone. Recently it‚Äôs still hard to pinpoint when exactly my mood starts changing and why, but I‚Äôm trying to maintain inner peace, and slow down and logic it out so I don‚Äôt do anything rash.

- **Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?**

If it‚Äôs within a large group, I would just keep quiet or act neutrally. Otherwise I don‚Äôt directly agree/disagree but I like to ask questions to coax them into telling me more about what they‚Äôre thinking. If they withhold, it‚Äôs no fun so I might change the topic or leave.",1610008846

if people go to mental health settings to seek out support and like minded people, which i would assume would be the strongest in ISFJs, then why is it consistently that they are underrepresented there, outside more milder / moderate stuff. i am specifically talking about ISFJs with more complex problems / severe mental illness, and personality disorders, and i never see that. what i do get a LOT is other types talking about what could be ""Traits"" or behaviors i may exhibit when they are describing something like their mom, girlfriend, or wife that is supposedly labeled as an ISFJ, but which does nothing to only belittle me and create more unresolved anger and depression, and lack of support of course when i've been trying all i can to put myself out there and find the right community or place or voice out what i feel in the capacity that i have has all but been just distress up to this point. 

in the discord server, i get responses that aren't actually giving me a proper response, all they do is answer my own question and / or just state something that is self evident, but doesn't actually answer why outside what a typical person would say. for example, one person had responded saying something like they ( ISFJs ) are less likely to put themselves out there or aren't usually gonna go to places like that. this is just telling me what i'm already seeing, but not why, even then, it's a black and white response to all the contextual factors i provided from beforehand in the channel of my experiences. 

another person went and suggested that there is a limitation in the MBTI, as if there are more types and other generalized statements that served nothing to perpetuate the actual problem. actually, if one looks logically, there wouldn't be more than 16 types if we are specifically addressing what the MBTI is capturing. we are only looking at cognitive functions, and yes, this is something very clear and evident, to suggest that there are more than 16 MBTI types would be senseless, even then, that still wouldn't answer why i have not been able to relate to anyone in particular or the particular problems i have had up to this point.

basically, every time i bring up a response or question, regardless of how much contextual experience or detail there is to it, either i get people who just provide a generalized theory or hypothesis and not an actual specified response to the experiences i have. it's extremely rare to find anyone who actually collects the pieces of what i wrote, one by one and then thinks, hmm....., he has a good point, but i don't have a valid answer, perhaps i can be ""humble"" and say i don't know...., because that's not what ends up happening, usually they either overcomplicate what i'm saying, when there could have been a specific response, for example, suggesting there's a limitation in the MBTI, when that does nothing to solve the matter, or they may perceive me as seeing things inaccurately or making a generalized view / stereotyping, when they are actually doing that themselves, not me...

now i'm ready to give more specified info, to the best that i can, but i first need a proper reciprocity to do that, and so far, up to this point, it hasn't been like that and / or i have had to go in great lengths to repeat myself over and over unnecessarily.",1609793400
isfj," When this girl was very young, she overheard her maternal grandparents mention in conversation that her mother was initially uncertain about giving birth to her due to having become pregnant whilst young and unwed. This led to her feeling worthless at an early age, and wondering if she was truly worth giving birth to... she feels as though her existence must have made things difficult for her mother, and feels like a burden. Although she does hear it when young, this conversation ultimately becomes a big part of her life - she remembers it forever, and thinks about it even in her teen years (of course, she does not remember the exact wording, but rather remembers the gist of it,) and this shapes many things about her. She urgently wants her mother's love; although her mother does love her and tries to tell her so, her mother still critiques her clothing and other things about her, leading to some resentment, and she feels/perceives based upon observation, or rather gets the sense that, her mother prefers her younger sister to her. She argues with her mother from time to time in regards to what has already been mentioned due to having such intense feelings, and yet wants badly to be talented and ‚Äúgood‚Äù at something so that her mother will see that she was worth having.

She tries her hand at different things, but can‚Äôt seem to succeed in any particular area. She does not perform well in school due to likely having an undiagnosed learning disability and feels that she is stupid, even though her parents encourage her to keep on trying. She is not physically attractive (she is slightly overweight, and cannot lose weight even when she tries to diet due to her father‚Äôs genetics,) and is not all that facially attractive either ‚Äì she is average looking to some, and below average looking to others. She cannot act, nor perfect public speaking, due to having stage fright, even though she does try. She is not particularly innovative or creative even though she is capable of understanding the bigger picture. She has friends, yet she is not popular, and often sits by herself at lunch, depressed (in fact, some of her peers tease her for being over-dramatic and emotional ‚Äì they find it ridiculous of her to be the way she is, as she has more money than a lot of kids in the neighborhood.) She spends a fair amount of her time, whenever she is not trying to perfect something that may, in her eyes, lead to her winning her mother's adoration and approval for once and for all, beating herself up over past mistakes and feeling bad about things that she has done and said... for example, she is sometimes mean to her little sister due to feeling jealous of her for being the child that she \*suspects\* her mother prefers, yet simultaneously understands that her sister is young and that this is not actually her fault, and feels guilty for arguing with her mother, as she understands that her mother gave up a lot just to have her (she feels like even more of a burden when she thinks about this.) In spite of her great want to be successful in order to make her mother proud, she cannot actually seem to succeed in any area or walk of life. She is quite aware of this, and it makes her even more depressed‚Ä¶

She feels that her father is the only person who happens to understand her, as he can relate to her weight and depression issues, and always listens to her, even when she has locked herself inside of her room during a family outing.

isfj," After walking into a coffee shop, this person notices a young woman sitting alone, crying - he heads over to her, wanting to comfort her/figure out what is wrong, and help, even though he has somewhere to be. He takes in her appearance somewhat when he sits down, and notices that she is conventionally attractive even though she is dressed down (though this is not important to him - helping her feel better is his goal.) He asks her politely what is wrong, and listens to her carefully along the way even though she is listing off ways in which she has been selfish (and even though she is what some may think of as whiney and annoying,) as he understands that she is remorseful and feels that she is putting too much blame on herself. He notices that she mentions that she does not have anyplace to stay due to tension with her parents, and although he is somewhat hesitant, offers to let her stay with him even though he has just moved into the city because he wants to help her get her life back to a steady place, and has been in a position before himself in which he felt terribly hopeless, and would not wish the same on anyone else, especially not a woman who seems to be sweet in spite of her flaws. He orders coffee for the woman and himself (though he does ask her what she would like,) and actually does move her into his new home, (he has just moved into the city for a new job,)and allows her to stay rent-free whilst she works on finding a job.

He lets her stay with him even after she has found a job, in part due to having developed an affection for her, in part due to simply being a nice guy, and in part due to understanding based upon their conversations (though he does not directly question her about her family, he simply listens when she talks about them... the woman in question is chatty when in a good mood,) that her tensions with her family members continue. He ends up allowing this woman's younger sister to stay with them as well, even though he finds her younger sister bossy and rude, because he has heard about her younger sister, and understands that even though she is a bit unlikeable, she has never had any positive role models in her life - he also understands that mending her familial relationship with her younger sister is very important to the woman he took in, and thereby lets her younger sister stay even though she is rude.

isfj,"Greetings, dear ISFJs, 

**I am a 23-year-old ENTP guy currently in love with a 21-year-old ISFJ gal and have been in love with her quite the time already**. To add more to the story, I've become infatuated with this girl at three points in my life, being this last one the most serious so far. 

**How do I know?** I can't stop thinking about her well-being on a daily basis, and I've never thought about a woman as much as this before so I consider it really surprising.

**Here's the story, I will try to keep it short:**

* She and I met each other in high school, in my sophomore year, and I had a slight crush on her during my senior year. We had a normal friendship and I asked her out a couple of times, **she was even my first date!** Sadly, she and I were too shy and not direct enough that I couldn't declare my love to her, so I graduated and left while she remained at school.
* **Around 3 years later**, I met her again but this time at university, during the middle of my law career studies. It was a big shock when I saw her with the freshman group at the medical school. Until then we had lost all contact and I'm sure she didn't choose the same university just because of me. 
* **We once again rebuilt our friendship** pretty quickly, and this time we got a little closer than that, to the point of going out, holding hands and all those things. She used to talk to me in a sweet, loving manner and I tried to do the same but, for some **STUPID** reason, when she asked me if I loved her I said ""I wasn't sure"" (*I'm quite dense, ain't I?*). After that, she became somewhat colder and we gradually talked less during the months until her birthday came and she presented her boyfriend to me. I was **heartbroken**, but I had to stay at the party for 3 hours doing my best to keep my cool, to then go to a friend's house to drink until morning. From that point out, we stopped talking again (I believed that, since I still had feelings for her, keeping in touch would damage her relationship).
* **Two years ago**, around 1 year after the events in the last bullet, she reached again out to me to wish my father a Happy Father's Day (***yes, my parents know her and, I'll be damned, they LOVE her***).  After that, we started talking again and got into a friendship again, but by that point, I had developed a much more tranquil attitude. We went out from time to time and I helped her with some studies, she's always acted flirty from time to time so I just laughed at followed in sometimes. When I asked her about our relationship, she said ""we never really tried it out"" so probably she didn't make a big deal out of it. 
* From then until now we remained friends, and we talk almost on a daily basis. Nonetheless, I find her much... colder. She's grown into a beautiful, mature, strong, hard-working, and kind-hearted lady, but I feel something's not the same.

**I haven't told her how I feel, but I try to show it with actions** such as visiting her, asking her how she's feeling every time I can, and cheering her up when she's got tests and such. Her mother is a great person and I genuinely like her, she also likes my parents and our parents have a good relationship. 

Sometimes, though, **I feel my love is falling into an empty pit**. **For instance**, she sometimes leaves me on *seen* when I text her, taking her time to reply. I understand it's because of her studies and such, but sometimes I can see her doing other things online that make me believe she has free time but answering me back is just not a priority to her, whenever I want to send her a present, she tries to reject it. And every time I tell her how great I believe she is and how much I care about her, she seems dodgy. 

She once confessed to me an ex of hers did a lot of damage, and after her failed relationships I'm starting to think she could be afraid of showing affection once more, but it's just a theory.

And that's it. **Thank you for reading this far, I greatly appreciate your time and will to help a brother out**. Please, give me your honest opinions and suggestions, I will receive them with my arms open.

I hope you all have a great day.",1609684034
isfj,"I think that because of my Fe I constantly am looking at what others think of/feel about me.

I think that some of it comes from that when I was little I was always seeking approval from my father, because he's super strict and that was at least something positive coming from him. I've always been a ""good girl"" in most parts of my life, especially school. But I want to break free from this. Any thoughts and tips on being less reliant on others on this aspect?",1609683076

Te: I tend to make plans and to-do lists and prefer to get tasks done as efficiently as possible. 
If I see people slacking at work or during group assignments I give them tasks to keep them busy.
Idk if this is a Te thing but I hate it when people just repeat what someone else just said during group discussions just to keep conversation going.


Fe: when someone asks for my help I usually go out of my way to help them, like if my friend asks for help to understand an assignment I don't just let them see how I've done it but also send additional resources that might be helpful.
People fighting makes me feel genuinely uncomfortable even if I'm not even involved it just give me a bad gut feeling I can't describe it but I figured it has to do with upsetting social harmony.

isfj,"I can‚Äôt grasp the concept of functions since when trying to type myself the knowledge of functions seems endless since there are lots of details but I can‚Äôt understand concepts or bug picture ideas so I‚Äôll just list reasons why I might think I have the Si Fe Ti Ne stack according to what I think is right:

Si:
- memories swarm my mind way too much. most of the memories seem insignificant at times but I simply get reminded of the past way too much and I compare the present a lot to the past. But it usually ends there and doesn‚Äôt lead to any sort of decision being made (maybe because it‚Äôs a perceiving function). 
- I am someone who likes routine and what they are familiar with. I never really try anything new or change things up to lose that stability. I‚Äôve liked the same things since childhood and haven‚Äôt grown too much in what I like or dislike. I am pretty unhealthy so I do tend to never venture out and try new things since that burns me out really quickly and makes me want to go back to that stability again.
- this is a common theme from other posts I‚Äôve read but I can remember the lyrics of the music after listening to it a few times, I am at my best when I know exactly what to do since it feels comfortable and the feelings will be in my reach when I achieve a goal using practical methods. I‚Äôm not one to try new methods but ones that seem to already work. I don‚Äôt fix what isn‚Äôt broken. This has always been something I‚Äôve always done and small details remind me lots about events that have occurred in the past. I don‚Äôt try to dwell on the and usually don‚Äôt. 

Fe:
- I try to include everyone and I strive for unity. I put my own needs before others and saddle peoples problems on my back because I don‚Äôt want to see them burdened. I don‚Äôt have strong opinions and I am always caring about what others will feel and think like and I do my best to accommodate for them based on what I think may work best. I can be a bit judgemental and outlash when I am angry but that‚Äôs a last resort when I think no one respects me and everyone sees me as a bad person. I am very passive aggressive and never honest with how I feel since I never think about how I feel very much.

Ti:
- logic seems to be endless and I‚Äôm always fine tuning concepts over and over again to learn how I can best live my life. I break things down to an emotionally detached level and work my way from there. I can‚Äôt say much else since I don‚Äôt understand this function too well but I am a person who favours the steps a lot more than outcomes and I‚Äôm definitely not goal oriented but someone who likes being in the middle of things. Starting and ending things are too uncomfortable.

Ne:
- this is a form of inner Hope where I try to look at things from a different perspective to get past my Si narrative. I am catastrophic in nature and see the ways things go wrong. Now I‚Äôm unsure of whether this could be auxiliary Ni but it never seems to be multiple bad things but rather one bad way things can go. But it is always if I fix one thing then something else about it will go wrong and I don‚Äôt come to peace until it actually happens and I realise that I‚Äôve judged the future too harshly since none of what I fear ever comes true, and I fear way too much about things. I tend to give up things that aren‚Äôt appealing and quickly stop things that I‚Äôve started because I just either don‚Äôt care or I‚Äôve burnt myself out.

However, all of my friends including the INTP didn‚Äôt pick sides (at least that‚Äôs what I think) and said that we are acting childish  and we should stop.

isfj,"Having started reading about this topic, my impression, as an ENTP, is that an ENTP gets way more out of a relationship with an ISFJ than vice versa. An Isfj seems to invest much more time, energy, and heart into the relationships providing a lot of precious emotional support and stability to an ENTP partner in dire need of that (even though he or she sometimes might not realize it, appreciate it enough, or is able to show the appreciation properly). However, I struggle to see what an ENTP provides in exchange (beyond a constant source of annoyance, which is something I guess \^\^). This type of relationship seems to be a little one-sided, which does not sound fair. Shouldn't a good relationship be for the benefit of both partners, who contribute equally, but in different ways?

isfj," This guy is sixteen-seventeen years old. He maintains high GPA in school; he has always been a bit of a teacher‚Äôs pet, though he does actually learn in his classes (his mother has always maintained that it is important to learn in school, and he does listen to her ‚Äì he pays attention in his classes and has usually picked up a good amount by the time the semester has ended.) He takes courses that challenge him, and always completes his homework on time. He does think about his future, which is partly why he ensures that he is maintaining good grades in school, and that he has good extracurriculars ‚Äì he does have some ideas in regards to what he wants to do career-wise, but is open-minded about it. He wants to end up in a position of financial security, and does not want to live with his parents for too long, as he sees that they are doing a great job of raising he and his younger siblings, and wants to ‚Äúpay them back‚Äù for it by being successful. He does not quite know what he wants to do with his life, but is exploring his options and understands that he will figure it out along the way.

He is generally a ‚Äúgood child‚Äù and known for being this throughout the city; although he is willing to argue against rules his parents may make that are unfair or illogical, he is not rebellious and does not cause trouble for his parents‚Ä¶ the other adults know that being around him will keep their kid out of trouble. He actually does absorb/pay attention to what his parents (particularly his mother,) say to him, the most of any of their kids. He is people-pleasing, and does not like feeling as though he has disappointed or upset those around him. This has led to him being used by others in the past, though he has an eye for when people are trying to do this now, and can handle the situation without giving into it in the way he once did. He speaks four different languages fluently, as his mother has taught him to, and he has an affinity for languages due to his good memory and desire to connect to others.

He is rather organized; he keeps a neat room, as he notices when things are messy and simply prefers the tidiness. He keeps his desk and locker organized as well. He keeps himself well-groomed physically, as his mother advises he and his siblings to; whilst he does not spend a ton of time on his appearance, he does buy clothing that he knows is trendy, consistently gets a haircut, works out, etc. He generally does things to maintain his physical appearance, as he is aware that it is something that others are judging him on (his mother has explained the Halo Effect to he and his siblings many times.) He is Class President, in part due to his popularity amongst his peers, and in part due to him actually having good ideas (he has listened to what his classmates‚Äô criticisms of their school happen to be, and does plan to enact change in the school system based upon how they feel.)

¬∑ He finds it surprising when others think that his life is perfect, as although he is quite popular, he actually spends about 99% of his energy trying to be likable/ensure that he is well-liked even though those around him can‚Äôt quite tell, and worries about whether or not certain people like him in private (he also has difficulty taking criticism and tends to internalize it somewhat, even though his mother has tried to teach him not to.) He struggles with anxiety in private, though you wouldn‚Äôt guess it if you met him (he practices certain meditation techniques to help him out with this, though the anxious part of his personality is something that he is good at hiding from people.) He also feels on some level as though everything falls on him, even though his parents have not pressured him into feeling this way, to be the ideal role model for his two younger siblings ‚Äì he does think about them and finds it important to succeed for them (his mother has caught onto this and tries to remind him that it is alright to do certain things that he enjoys, just for himself.) He smokes marijuana occasionally with friends as a way to relax/feel good (he also succumbed a bit to peer pressure,) and feels guilty about this, as although his mother is open-minded, she has explained the impacts to him. He's actually quite well-adjusted.

He does not date often due to his focus on performing well in school, even though a few girls are interested in him (he actually struggles with romantic relationships, as he does not want for the person to get to know him \*too well\* and perhaps discover his insecurities under the image that he essentially portrays.)

isfj,"\- She recently joined a sorority even though she never actually planned to join one because she wanted a fresh start in a new college with a new beginning. 

\- She said her sorority brought her out of her comfort zone, opened her eyes to new ideas, taught her to work better with others, and showed her what her own capabilities and independence are

\- Has an Only Fans where she doesn‚Äôt post nudes but does personal requests. Some strangers screenshotted thumbnails of her content in a folder and shared it with others publicly but she made a new one and is still posting there

\- Very active on social media; I believe she‚Äôs somewhat addicted to the validation and attention she gets from people praising her there.

\- She‚Äôs very easily influenced by the people she hangs around, getting into piercings and tattoos because her friends have them, liking raves because her friends attend them, etc.

\- Suspicious by nature, but gullible if she‚Äôs friends with them. She‚Äôll be cautious and skeptical of people‚Äôs intentions and character; however if she knows them personally and they‚Äôre nice to her, she‚Äôll be trusting of them and see everything they do in a good light.

\- Very insecure, constantly compares herself (especially her looks) to others, wants plastic surgery, nitpicks her appearance, and has body dysmorphia. However I feel like she needs validation, so she posts on social media a lot for compliments.

\- Ever since she was a preteen, she‚Äôd get anxious thinking about her future and the future in general.

\- Has anxiety, including social anxiety. She‚Äôs scared of many things such as her grades, quitting jobs, her own driving, transferring schools, changing her hair even though she wants to, paranormal things, the dark, and even eating jelly which is why she‚Äôs only had pb&amp;j once. She also gets paranoid over potential health issues, often self-diagnosing diseases.

\- She‚Äôs really scared of rejection and always wonders if she‚Äôs doing something wrong or annoying people. Another one of her biggest fears is disappointing her loved ones.

\- Extremely nice, kind girl but is easily taken advantage of. 

\- Used to be very shy and stutter a lot but has gotten out of her shell after joining her sorority.

\- Often speaks her opinions on twitter, saying things like how people need to learn manners or how she can‚Äôt stand people who count favors. 

\- She can be stubborn over some opinions, saying those opinions are right. 

\- Stresses how important it is to communicate issues

\- Quite sensitive and cries easily. She once talked about complicated customers interrogating her about the restaurant‚Äôs menu and while telling the story, her voice was getting shaky and her eyes were tearing up. She also wants to cry whenever someone raises their voice at her.

\- She said she always gets let down every time she‚Äôs happy, and she thinks that will never change. 

\- She‚Äôs quite open about her personal life with people

\- Can be impatient, sees herself as the most impatient person ever, and can have an attitude at times when she‚Äôs stressed or angry about something (ex: accidentally sassing friends/bf).

\- Hates when people are quick to judge. She won‚Äôt judge someone by their past or reputation until they show that they haven‚Äôt changed a bit.

\- Doesn‚Äôt enjoy continuously thinking about the past, but says that it just happens. 

\- Her school notes are extremely organized, color-coordinated, and decorated. She procrastinates a lot, but also studies very hard once she starts to the point of studying while cooking. 

\- She cares about making and saving money, but she also has bad spending habits. However she has more savings than other friends and people our age. 

\- She associates a lot of songs with memories and those songs make her feel a certain way. She also feels happy, sad, etc. whenever she sees Snapchat memories. 

\- Her friend (who she wasn‚Äôt close to) recently passed away a few weeks ago. She still thinks of him every day and all the memories they had together, and still gets sad on the daily. 

\- She has a hard time staying single and always wants to be in relationship. She likes hanging out with a lot of friends and enjoys going out with them.",1609391095

isfj,"I was typed as an ENFP but after some Si experiences, I started to consider ISxJ again. I dislike repetitive tasks and I would like to figure it out once and do something else. I'm also non-procedural.

I thought ISxJ because...

* A random thing can make me replay a completely random memory and

* My tendency to worry about COVID-19 (That's my ONLY source of stress)

This may or may not be inferior Ne or any other inf function: I was going to eat my lunch outside but I couldn't take off my mask and simply eat it because what if I catch COVID for no reason? I also couldn't even throw the paper into trash because yet again, what if I catch COVID for no reason? That was my ONLY fear at that time. Hyperfocus. Then, I ranted about that to my family and I couldn't let it go. It felt like I deceived myself. I thought I was a pretty relaxed person and now I need to consider myself unhealthy? I was stuck in the past for a while and then, it went away. I also considered ""I'll never wear mask, get COVID and face my fear head-on!""

Can an ISxJ be non-procedural, generalist and dislike repetition? (Si is regarded as specialists, procedural and reptitive by neurologists and I have none of them)

He does directly ask her if she is alright, and even though she begins to dramatically list off reasons as to why she is not, he still patiently/carefully listens without speaking, and learns that she is not returning home due to tensions with her parents, and that her younger sister has run away. Although her situation is ""heavy"" so to speak, he still urgently wants for her to feel better, as he understands that what she is going through must undoubtedly be difficult, and was depressed for a few years himself - although he is a bit hesitant to do so, he offers to let her stay with him, as he truly does want her to feel better/have a place to live in and thinks that he can help her mend her relationship with her parents and younger sister, or at least assist in the process. He buys her coffee as well even without her asking (though he does check to see what she likes,) and follows through on his offer to let this stranger stay with him after hearing about her situation (i.e. she does end up actually staying with him, which is a bit uncomfortable for him as he is introverted, but he figures that he himself will get used to it and wants her to feel comfortable in the meantime.) He allows her to stay with him without paying rent whilst she finds a job, although he has just moved into the city himself. Who would do this?

isfj," This guy is a successful salesman - he is successful in part due to his great interpersonal skills (he is charismatic and you sense when speaking to him that he wants to get to know you, even though he is making a sale,) and his ambition (he has always wanted to be financially stable due to wanting to live a gratifying life without having to worry about money - his father often spoke about saving money when he was growing up - and he is partly ambitious due to wanting to help his wife out in providing for their three children. He does not want them to be too spoiled, and knows that his wife works hard in regards to her own job, but understands that it takes two great incomes to maintain their home and help pay for what their kids need. He genuinely cares about his wife and supporting her, as he sees her hard work and partly works so hard in regards to his own job to lend her a helping hand, and to ensure that he is a good role model for his own children.) He always likes to ensure that he knows at least a bit about a product before he tries selling it to be safe/avoid feeling anxious, though he has been able to sell products in the past even when he did not know a great deal about the product due to his aforementioned charisma (he can honestly be a \*bit\* manipulative when selling products, but not in a malicious way in the slightest...)

His social skills help him out a great amount in regards to his job as a salesman; he has always been popular amongst groups of people, even going back as far as elementary school - he aimed to be popular in elementary school as he felt in his household that since he was the middle child, his spotlight was stolen by his older brother, or his younger sister. He aimed to be known for being ""cool"" and him being so personable led to him being voted in class president against the richest girl in school. He did enjoy hearing gossip (and still does, honestly,) but does not necessarily partake in it (i.e. he does not really speak negatively about other people unless he dislikes someone - and he is honest about it when he dislikes people, though not too blunt - but he does enjoy hearing about the business of others from friends.) Although he has never been what some would consider to be dumb, he maintained average grades whilst in elementary and middle school due to not having a serious interest in the subject matter - however, since he ended up dating (and later on marrying,) the smartest girl in his grade (he was interested in her due to her being pretty, kind, and finding her intelligence attractive... he liked that she was always helping he and other people out, yet also capable of solving nearly any problem,) he asked her in high school to help him raise his grades, as he understood that he needed to start maintaining higher grades in order to start seriously looking at a career (he also saw his girlfriend succeeding academically and wondered, on some level, why he deserved her. He wanted to be the guy that she deserved to have, or at least this was how he thought of it, and also wanted to help himself out career-wise.)

He actually committed to raising his grades with her help, even though it was difficult at first to maintain a consistent studying routine as he always wanted to sit down and relax after school, or head out with some friends. He had always maintained a healthy romantic relationship with her even whilst dating due to being willing to talk out different issues with her (she had to start the conversation, but he was open to it and willing to listen, as he really did want to make things work.) He did end up attending a good school in regards to college due to his dedication, and even though he did care for her, he and his aforementioned girlfriend agreed to break off their relationship for a little while due to attending different schools (he was upset about this, but tried dating two other people in college, as did she... only to find that it didn't ""feel the same"" and that he missed her too much. She would later on report feeling the same.) After graduating, he re-connected with his former girlfriend due to understanding based upon his other two relationship experiences that she was his best match (and hoping that she still felt the same - she did!)

He found his first sales job through a social connection (through a buddy of his,) as he ensured that he networked throughout college (partly due to his aspirations, and this was partly natural - he is the kind of person who would have made connections no matter what school he went to,) and although he did have some fun as he learned more about the sales world, he still made sure to take his job seriously, as he knew that he wanted a future with his girlfriend and financial stability. He moved up in the ranks due to his social skills and interest in improving at the job, and married his girlfriend - he, of course, begun to work harder and harder after their kids were born. However, he recalled his own father having been a workaholic, and feeling that he didn't get to know him as well as he could have due to this (and feeling that his father was boring and only ever rambled about money); for this reason, although he makes sure that he establishes boundaries with his kids (he, along with his wife, encourages them to maintain at least average grades in school and undoubtedly parents them,) he still successfully gets to know his children as people and pays attention to them. He has a genuine relationship with each of his children, and even though he can be direct with them at times, is loved by them - he is usually understanding of their feelings, yet does not tolerate disrespect from them toward he or his wife and is clear about this.

She is known for being one of the most, if not the most, intelligent women in the city she lives in (she had grown up there, even though she was born in another state and lived elsewhere whilst attending college,) and was class valedictorian in high school due to her academic prowess (she has always been competitive in regards to academics, and was a typical ""good student"" whilst in school - had perfect attendance every year except one, always scored high on tests, maintained the highest GPA of any student in the school in her high school and even before that, won the ""Student of the Year"" award multiple times, etc.) She struggled with being a people-pleaser and pushover when young due to naturally being nice (though she was devious enough to go along with/assist in her best friend's pranks, even though some of their classmates were not,) and having some self-esteem issues, but started to steadily become more confident in middle school and high school. She has always been confident in regards to her logical conclusions, though, as she has always understood that she is smart, and prided herself on being known as ""the smart one"" amongst her peers. She was a very high-achieving student in high school with great extracurriculars and grades - although she considered a few different paths, she ultimately decided that she wanted to study neuroscience due to feeling that the area was a perfect intersection of the physical and the abstract, in addition to wanting to learn more about biology/the human brain and feeling that the field had the potential to transform human health (she also realized in her sophomore year that she tended to dedicate a fair amount of time to reading about the brain and its functions, even though she did read up on a great number of other subjects.)

She attended a top school and graduated as one of the first in her class there due to her dedication to studying the topic - she met up with the guy who she had dated for many years from elementary school to high school (who is the extroverted salesman that she is married to,) and begun dating him again, as although she tried dating someone else (as did he,) in university, she found that there had not been the same level of comfort and understanding as there had been in her relationship with him. They ended up marrying and she had three children with him, though she ensured that she found work before she became pregnant, and begun a savings account with her husband in order to make sure that their kids would have college funds/enough money in general. As a mother, she is great, even though she did have some concerns about her potential parenting - she is self-aware in regards to most mistakes that she may be making/have made as a parent, but is actually a very good mother. She ensures that her kids maintain at least average grades in school (she is not too hard on them about this, though she is still clear about her expectations,) and that they are actively learning - she encourages them to read, introduces and encourages different kinds of learning styles, brings in game-based learning, etc. She does want them to maintain good grades, as she does think about their futures and wants to set the kids onto a path of success in the world (though she understands that it is about more than simply ending up with a high-paying job, and does not pressure them into choosing a certain career, but rather tries to help them explore different options and encourage them to move toward what they are actually interested in,) but is also concerned about them actually learning, and keeps a library of books in the house. She is very well-read on important aspects of a child's development, and also encourages a healthy social life amongst her kids, making sure that they have friends and understand social etiquette. She likes to keep a schedule, but is still willing to move along when things do not go according to plan, even though it can make her a bit uncomfortable/anxious.

She is conventionally attractive, and aware of this - she styles herself in a certain way due to understanding that as a woman, she is being judged by many based upon her physical appearance (she will begin talking about the Halo Effect and different studies when her children ask,) and encourages all of her children to be well-groomed/take care of their physical appearance for this reason (particularly her daughter, as she knows that it will be more important for her, but she is not nitpick-y in regards to her children's appearances, and simply encourages them to look presentable whilst also encouraging them to not be shallow.) She does know how to set healthy boundaries in regards to her children. She is usually the person who cooks for the family (she sets a specific time for this,) and particularly makes healthy foods, as she finds it important based upon her readings for the people in the house to have a balanced diet (they complain about this, though she lets them order takeout from time to time.) She is usually patient with her children, and even though they do not always show their appreciation for her, they undoubtedly love and value her.

She has an obsessive need with needing to be the best, in spite of her parents being supportive (though her father does encourage her to receive good marks.) She is unable to think of anything to write in regards to a poem, or at least anything that may lead to her winning, as whilst she is capable of coming up with creative solutions (or just solutions in general) to problems if asked, she has difficulty writing with true emotional depth in the way some can and is aware of this. She is afraid of ""looking dumb"" because that would prove that she is not actually as smart as people think. She is self aware that she's willingly taken the ""smart one"" role amongst her peers and maintaining that role is a lot of pressure... she is naturally shy and passive by nature, and feels that being smart is what makes her stand out as someone special. Because of this, she plagiarizes the poem (this happens before the age of the Internet,) and does end up winning the poetry contest with the plagiarized poem. She initially tries to justify the cheating to herself in order to ease her guilty conscience after winning... but her guilty conscience leads her to imagine the trophy staring her down, and the trophy talking to her every time she looks at it. She is asked by the principal of the school to read her poem, although she initially intends on confessing when he sits her down. Even though she has this opportunity in front of her, she still feels guilty, and imagines the trophy talking to her. She does sit to herself and say, "" You didn't do the hard work you're capable of. You stole a poem and called yourself a poet. You should have searched deep inside yourself like all real poets do."" The guilt is enough to a point in which she is noticeably upset enough for her parents to notice (her father practices fencing with her,) even though she will not give direct reasoning at the time for her displeasure. On the day in which she is supposed to present the poem, she confesses to her parents a bit earlier, and then confesses to the principal with them in front of her right before it is her turn to go up. She admits that being the best is important to her: "" I'm used to being the best, sir. That's who I am."" When the principal asks her if there is more to who she is than being the best, she states, ""I really don't know, sir."" Who would do this?

Is this a backhanded compliment/joke?

So ive been friends with this person for 6 years and he is gay ( i typed him exfj probably esfj)I love him as hes there for me and hes willing to listen to me. I mean we are always there for each other

There are times whe  he jokes. Most of his jokes are harmless and have no basis ( or could be) . He told me that i could reach out to him in case i get offended by his jokes so that means he doesnt get defensive and is willing to change for the sake of friendship. He also admitted that he could hurt me unknowingly so i gotta tell him to stop lol. I mean friends joke i get it but i think when he says those things he means them.

There are times when he jokes  that im an international cameo star signing up for the role as a maid or any of these entry level acting then he will say joke! Other times he would say only im the only ""cameo star"" worth to be trusted or im the cameo star who will travel to japan someday and other weird stuff. I mean i feel those jokes are manipulative like when u lift someone and ""diminish"" them indirectly later on. You may think i got affected but i dont depend of those things so im not affected easily and i think theyre cringe or unneccesary just to dominate the conversation. I mean my bff isnt a bad person but he admitted he could get somehow  childish.

Sometimes he would jokingly tell me that if i was a cake i would be a plain chocolate cake no toppings or some weird words lmao then  say joke afterwards. 

At first i didnt mind these things but as time passed by i began to notice the pattern. He started doing this around early of 2020 lol

Are these signs of backhanded compliments?",1608651027

He was in a relationship with an INFJ girl, who, to pursue her goals and seeking settlement for her family in another country, told him to end it, out of nowhere. These 4 years had been miserable for him already as he went to another country to pursue his medical degree, and had been lonely too much without family, friends, separated from her too.

Some terms sound similar to each other, I want to see if those terms will have similar scores among types.

isfj,"My ex took the 16 personalities test and scored as an ISFJ.  I was quite shocked because I thought he seemed more extroverted and definitely not of the feeling variety.  I even considered he wasn‚Äôt honest in answering the questions... I really didn‚Äôt expect his result.  For example, I felt he was extroverted because when we were out somewhere, he seemed to like to be noticed.  For example, he might make a loud remark for the purpose of trying to gain attention from a bartender or another patron of a restaurant.  He seemed to need external stimuli from others more than enjoying his own company.  He also came across as someone who needed to feel important and status was very important.  He seemed very sensitive to criticism but would be the first to criticize someone else. He just didn‚Äôt seem to be emotionally intelligent.  He was excellent at remaining composed and vague when communicating through text.  When communicating in person he could become moody, condescending, and impatient.  After reading up about ISFJ‚Äôs I do feel he was similar in the way he was family oriented and valued tradition. However, his caregiving style seemed to be a bit self-centered.  For example, he didn‚Äôt believe in giving material items as gifts, instead he would gift family members a trip and would accompany the person to the destination.  

He was very frugal when it came to some things, but he was a snob about what he would eat or his accommodations.  His friendships seemed to be based on status.  His friends were all wealthy or people who could provide him with some type of service.  He claimed to hate conflict but wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to be passive aggressive or sneakily seek revenge.  If ever confronted, he‚Äôd become highly defensive and refuse to communicate.  

Does this sound like ISFJ behavior?  I know there are unhealthy people of all types, but he just seemed so egotistical and his idea of providing comfort seemed to be based on what made him feel good.",1608512755

isfj,"Hey y‚Äôall. I‚Äôll try to keep the vital context brief. I‚Äôve been on a few dates with an ISTJ guy this year and I grew feelings around the 4th date, when we shared a first kiss.

The ISTJ guy doesn‚Äôt respond much to my text messages/responds with just an emoji more times than not. Sometimes he doesn‚Äôt respond back to my messages until a couple of days after. I had been feeling frustrated and thought to state (by text due to lockdown) how I was feeling about things without me getting too emotional. 

His response:

‚ÄúI think its hard to progress things between meetings. I do like you and it could be more but I don't tend to dwell on it in the days in between seeing each other, otherwise I'd spiral with the scenarios I'd imagine üòÖ.

One was creating a discord server with all 16 types (my own idea and I've not seen somebody else do this before me)

Create a youtube channel with either all XNTX types or to be different all XNXP types. 

So I just have this thought what if we combine them and have a youtube channel with 16 types. This would mean a balanced perspective from all the types. Types like ESTJ ISTJ  and ESFP will achually get recognised for once as most mbti YouTube channels are just run by INXP or INXJs or at most ENXPs. 

It will be intresting to see how the 16 types work together setting up the foundations off the channel 

Different types will take on different role while setting it up. This dosnt mean IXFP cant be a leader or a Perciever can organise the channel but I think there are different roles that will suit different type better. 

All types will be on at some point especially when we are making a video about that specific type or that group off type however only some not sure how many will for videos not related for a certain type. 

We will probably have a discord invent new typing methods and build a website in the future

isfj,"So, I (ENTP female) went back to my hometown a few months ago and met this ISFJ(male) I went to school with. He was a few years my senior during middle school. He is 30 and I am 27 currently. He reads a lot of books and has business investing other peoples money in the stock market (we are not in North America so relatively easier to do this), we had amazing chemistry and he seemed to be really into me.

However, he would barely call/text and when he did it was super random. He would call and say hi and hang up after like 3-4 seconds. We started getting serious and would talk about marriage/ starting a family etc. He would tell me he feels complete with me and that he loves me.  After we had this conversation were fine for about 2-3 days after which he started not picking up my calls.  He told me he is not ready for a relationship and we broke it off. Fast forward 3 weeks we reconnected again, met him again, he says "" I know I haven't been the man you deserve but I promise I will try my best from now on"". I felt elated, we had the most amazing sex that night. Next day we decide I need Plan B (the day after pill) and he seems super cold. I ask him what is wrong he hands me the pill and tells me he has feelings for me but he cannot give me a commitment.

I was so mad. Not because he is not ready but because he literally just said he wanted those serious things with me and he promised to show etc and I felt so cheated. I completely cut off ties with him. Then I found out I was pregnant. I could not tell my parents, I did not have a driving license for my country (my hometown is in a different country from the one I live in) and I could not tell anyone about the pregnancy. I had to contact him, he immediately set up a meeting in the abortion clinic.  The next day he picks me up, he tries to comfort me and I remained very cold. I went through with the abortion, it was a traumatic experience for me. After the abortion he took me to a restaurant and tried to make me laugh. I felt dead inside, all I wanted to do was cry.

Anyway I stopped speaking to him after that, I wrote him a big essay on what a big jerk he is and I left the country. 2-3 months after returning back from my hometown I was doing great. I got a better job then the one I had left. I was happy, everything was good. He contacted me on Instagram saying he is sorry. I said it's ok and that it does not matter anymore.

THEN he drops a huge bomb on me. Apparently he says at first he was scared to get into a relationship but after we patched up the second time he wanted to get serious and marry me. He told his sisters about me but they did not approve since I am from a different clan then then him (Asian parents and he is related to royalty). He is adopted so he isn't even from that clan originally himself. So that is why he went cold the second time. Once he found out I was pregnant he told his sisters again that I was carrying his child and that he loved me and wanted to marry me. They again went berserk on him, he had to marry a girl from a certain clan.

He said once he lost me he had to take sleeping pills to sleep, he went to a meditation camp and he left his sisters house (his parents are no longer alive so his sisters are the matriarchs). He lived with one of his divorced sisters who is in her 40s and she seems to be very controlling. He said all he wants now is to marry me, make me happy and that he would like to be have children with me.  He also mentioned he thought I was too good for him which confused me.

This was all said through text, I forgave him but I thought we need a real skype conversation. So I said you know we have to have a real conversation about who is moving where, finances and more serious things if we want to move forward.  He would again start ignoring my calls, tell me I will talk to you tomorrow but never show up. I told him my parents are trying to get me engaged it is an important conversation. All he says is ""you should get Engaged"" (Conservative Asian parents).

I know he has a inferiority complex because he was adopted into royalty but he is not related to them by blood. I know he had a rough childhood, both of his parents died when he was a teenager. Usually I would chalk this behavior up to him being a Narc but IDK. I still want and ISFJ perspective.

isfj,"Have already concluded I am an ISXJ based on collaborating data I‚Äôve read from multiple books, but can‚Äôt grasp these axis‚Äôs. I am aware enneagram exists and might interfere with the cognitive functioning of my brain.

Reasons why I believe I prefer Fe-Ti axis:

- In social situations or around people I constantly assess the needs of others consciously. Finding ways they could do things better to solve problems, or trying to perceive how harmful some words can be to others when that problem could have been addressed in a manner that doesn‚Äôt cause the person to retaliate back.

-I try to avoid words that cause unnecessary conflict, and can notice when there is a rising tension between two people. I try my best to distract the two to relieve the two so they can take a break and perhaps solve their problems later on.

- I value kindness very, very much and strive to become a kinder person, but at the same time I know I don‚Äôt like people or their problems so any help I‚Äôd provide would be very basic. (Might be uncomfortable with helping other people since I have no idea what to do).

- Tertiary Ti engages me to do fun problem solving, however it can be pretty hard to express my internal framework of ideas. I am in love with subjects like chemistry which teaches you to think critically and apply knowledge and concepts. 

- I sometimes value inclusion, but only if there is a goal to achieve. Otherwise I prefer working alone as it‚Äôs more fast-paced and more can be achieved.

- Not sure if this counts but as a bonus I tend to look for the best in people to see what work could be done for them to reach their potential.

Reasons why I prefer the Te-Fi axis:

- Always thinking about ways to streamline things (though this may not be specific to this function as everyone is capable of this to varying degrees and/or could be brainstorming). 

- I am goal oriented and don‚Äôt need people to set goals for me. I hate people who are lazy or don‚Äôt work and I especially hate slowness and incompetence.

- My internal feelings are very private. I tend to lash out because I try to remain level-headed as don‚Äôt try to fight back because that‚Äôs a waste of my energy and know it‚Äôs not worth it. On the surface I am completely different: aloof, cold, careless. Not sure why I am like this either.

- I am someone who favours competition over cooperation. Competition mostly against myself however. Dislike competition with others since there‚Äôs nothing to really show off at the end. 

- My motivation mostly comes from being productive because I love working hard to do something when it comes from the heart. Thinking of ways to make studying more efficient and executing the best plans, which ultimately leaves me with no internal desire as I haven‚Äôt explored my own interests in anything particular as I try to be well-rounded in everything. A fan of to-do lists and keep a diary full of tasks I need to do so I know when I can achieve c goals and be productive.

- Fake people bother me to an extremely unhealthy level because they‚Äôre being someone they are not and that is stupid because they‚Äôre not willing to work on themselves to become better and you can never win against fake people to admit they are fake.

- I am the last person who can comfort someone. I feel basically nothing when someone is crying or excited since it‚Äôs their own path and life. If I try to help someone I will always give practical advice and would have no words of encouragement to relieve or sympathise with them. 

Feel free to tear me apart if needed, ask any more questions or give long answers.

isfj,"So, I recently find myself doubting a bit about my INFJ personality. So, the reason why I think that I'm an ISFJ are due to somethings, and I hope that you guys manage to reaffirm it to me XD:

\- Most of INFJ are 4w5 or 5w6, but I'm a 9w8. Nines are MUCH more common with ISFJ than INFJ, even more the 9w8

\- When I read the Ni-Ti loop, I imagined the INFJ like some crazy scientist, analyzing things and making future predictions. But, when I analyzed ISFJ Si-Ti loop, I found myself. I'm not entirely free from the loop, but some months ago I would find myself thinking about every single wrong detail that I did to ruin my past relationship, all the signs that she may gave me and everything about that past experience, trying to draw conclusions about it. My theraphist helped me with this, because I don't think it is bad to do this. Actually, It rendered me some good and stable conclusions, but some of them remain a little bit unstable. Also, people around me says that due to my behavior, they are sure that I'll never commit the same mistakes and that I managed to really ""extract knowledge"" from that experience, which is literally what I said to my therapist. I wanted to extract all the possible knowledge that this experience gave me.

\- I'm mostly unable to act until I search and find a ""method"". I love economics and it's my favorite subject. But, I'm not usually interested in reading too abstract things. Also, what I usually say to my friends is that I'm pretty much more happy and confortable ""learning what already exists, then sharing it to other people in a good and understandable way"" than being a researcher. I want to be a college teacher too. So, I think that I fit way more in a scientific communicator role than a researcher one.

\- Everytime that I want to learn something new, the first thin that I'll do is to search for the method people use to reach the same goal that I have. Every, single, time. My friend once recommend me Steppenwolf, from Hermann Hesse (one of my favorite writers). I researched him a bit and find out that Demian, other book from him, it's more like the teenager version of the protagonist of Steppenwolf. So, instead of reading Steppenwolf, I read Demian, because I felt that it was ""chronologically"" correct.

\- I do love writing and talking about deep stuff, like INFJ, but it is quite different. Nearly 90% of the things that I write are about my feelings and impressions that I have about the world, and 99% of them are from the past. I lost my mother when I was 13yo, and I really like to write about it, the perceptons and sensations. I don't know if that counts, but I think that this style of writing is way more ""ISFJ"" than ""INFJ""",1608071362

isfj,"I was wondering if there are any ISFJs here or if you know any ISFJ diagnosed with some kind form of psychosis or psychotic related condition. originally i wanted to ask to see if there was any ISFJ diagnosed specifically with schizotypal personality disorder and major depression as that's what i'm diagnosed with. i understand that the discussion i'd want to have and details i'd want to give would be too much, so i was hoping i could at least know what symptoms you guys have, if you do have a psychotic related condition or know any ISFJ that does. it's important that i get the full context of what your experiences or symptoms are, because many people can be put into these labels, but without context, it doesn't pinpoint to anything qualitatively distinct.

 in my case, with the diagnosis(s) i just mentioned, i do not meet the criteria for any form of psychosis, but rather i suffer from severe emotional / psychological disturbances / abuses from the past and ongoing, combined with past and ongoing physiological impairments, and unfavorable circumstances / living factors. 

it angers me that the definition of psychosis makes it seem like it's supposed to be very broad when it says such as hallucinations or delusions or this or that, yet 100 percent of the people and cases basically have every single criteria to which it says, such as this or that. so then i'd ask the question to the researchers themselves, we'll then what else is left if you don't fit into any of these categories or symptoms..., if you don't and never had any form of hallucinations, delusions, or odd somatic or sensory experiences, etc, then what...

basically, i have a big problem with the definition of psychosis. there hasn't been one person who was able to give a proper identification of what is or wouldn't be psychosis. they like to think it's complex by suggesting that exactly, when really, it's not. these are the type of people who immediately when they have no other answer of their own, would simply say, we'll, it depends on the person, or it's more complicating than you think. first of all, prove that it's more complicating, don't just assume that it is, second of all, that's a terrible answer. next time someone says anything mental health relating, i'll just say, it depends on the person always. but i wouldn't, because it's a stupid answer and doesn't do anything good in a highly specific context. yes, if the conversation was general or it was a starting point, then sure, maybe it would be ok to say that casually, but then lead to a more contextual response, but 99 percent of people don't do this, and when you ask them to explain, they'll either just say, we'll it's complex and / or it depends on the person type of answer. and in my head im like, i understand, but what is YOUR experience of the condition and how you see it..., but never have i gotten such a qualitatively answer that stood out from the rest that actually was a good answer. 

even though i haven't gotten ISFJs to respond yet as im typing this to post, i personally have two viewpoints, i either feel that psychosis is much more lucid than other people think, meaning that the symptoms or w.e are mostly similar to one another and are very stereotypically the same, a.k.a delusions, etc, or somatic experiences, OR there is another form of psychosis in which i would have, which is EXTREMELY rare, less than 5 percent of the ""psychotic"" population lets just say, that is more of pseudo psychosis where the individual's experience is actually his / her reality, because it's more ofa built up of their personality, something they've become use to or they somehow manage it in a way that makes them seem on the outside more or less like ""normal"" people, but what they actually have is severe psychosis constantly being inhibited from becoming fully blown out of control plea, anger and emotions exploding. this form of ""psychosis"" is the most severe, and although symptom wise, on the outside it looks to be sort of under the radar or other people think this person is ""normal"", it's highly fatal and the person can go from 0 to 100 instantly and kill themselves from becoming unrestrained and violent to themselves and others. the experience only happens to ISFJs, hence the lower prevalence, however, i still believe that this is not psychosis at all, as prognosis for this or people that have these kinds of problems is poor, and it doesn't benefit at all from antipsychotics, but you could say my reasoning here becomes complicated, because now i change my belief half way, so that the reason for antipsychotics not working, is not because of it not being ""psychosis"", but rather the ""psychosis"" or w.e type of impairment the person has is not helped by these brain damaging drugs.

now a further question comes through, we'll if these are brain damaging drugs, then how do they work and help so many people with ""psychosis"", we'll, that is the question isn't it, and no one has been able to do a proper study for this or examination. a similar or supplemented hypothesis or question could be, ""if schizoaffective patients can have severe depression, then how would you go about treating them properly, if they also have ""psychosis"", because it doesn't matter what type of psychosis, we should be treating more or less the same is what the psychiatrists and mental health professionals would say, rather than looking at the individual and the nature of the problem, rather than the diagnosis..., 

i only met one person i think, this was in person, who had a diagnosis of schizophrenia or psychotic related condition, and interestingly enough, he was the only one who didn't have any type of hallucination or seeing / hearing things that are not there type of thing, it was interesting, because he was also the same nationality as me or almost the same, and might have possibly had the same MBTI type as me, the reason why i mentioned this nationality and mbti thing is that for the few people whom i felt most similar to, at least for certain traits they exuded, were of same nationality type and perhaps, same MBTI type. i question if the guy even had ""psychosis"", although i didn't have a chance to talk to him one on one, and although i attended the clinic several times thereafter, i never saw him again. i think what made the experience even more important was i think he might have said he wasn't taking any medication concurrently. he did mention of one experience at least, where he charged his father and then felt guilty in a way for doing it, but i didn't seem to really relate there, i mean, at least for me, i had at least one episode with my father, but it was provoked and my anger towards him was done so logically, because he was being the narcissistic person he was and i was only doing what anyone else would do if someone was constantly being a shitty person to you or w.e ( he was doing his usual degrading lecturing to me ), although i didn't charge at him directly, ( this only happened once when my brother pushed me too far and i was at my worst homeostasis / state ), but for my father situation, i just expressed my physical anger indirectly by verbalizing it and then punching a hole in a wall and smashing the table, obviously, in my brother's case, that episode was the worst one i think, because i actually charged at him with a unconscious uncontrolled point a to b to want to kill him, which i did punch him in the face but of course, he then got me to the floor to restrain me, dabbed me in the face a few times while just before, i let out some contained emotions / agitation / irritability by screaming like the people you'd see in a mental hospital.",1607850988

To an INFJ, ISFJs feel so familiar yet completely different at the same time. So I decided to ask for advice.

I have a dear ISFJ friend who is always giving out gifts to people. He also compromises a lot in everday life. For example, I try out a game in his shared steam library. The moment I express mild interest, he's already heading to the store to buy a DLC. 

If that's what makes him happy, everythings fine. The problem is that he won't accept anything in return. He even seemed uncomfortable when we tried to congratulate him on his birthday.

Not only is it uncomfortable for me to keep recieving, I personally believe someone can last with only giving with nothing in return. However, I also want to respect him and express my gratitude in ways he actually appreciates. 

Is this something ISFJs relate to, if so, would you mind sharing the kinds of expression (words/gifts etc.) that you were comfortable with? I'll try to figure out how to adapt in real life. Thanks for reading!",1607846355

Impostor  syndrome can be experienced by anyone, and it is often discussed in the  context of high achievers, for when they don't fulfill their very high  expectations of themselves. I recall one article that was like ""it's  totally understandable for ambitious people to encounter impostor  syndrome on their rise to whatever especially entrepreneurs"".

I  don't consider myself a particularly ambitious person though I know how  much society frowns on lack of ambition. I have a full-time job in  advertising, but I very much prefer being an individual contributor,  have little interest in managing others (I hate following up and feeling  like I am imposing). Is anyone here also not particularly ambitious /  content with a certain level of responsibility but still feel like  they're out of place? I just started my job last year, a completely new  industry and I STILL feel like there's so many things I just haven't  picked up yet that I don't know how I'm where I am. I told my therapist  my feelings and she's like ""has anyone called you out or said anything  directly to you?"" And the answer is no. There are so many situations  were I just don't know what to say or when to chime in unless  specifically addressed. 

This isn't to say I don't have any goals in life, it's that I just work to live, rather than live to work, as it seems so many people in our world do. I just don't have any grand plan as far as my career goes; it's like rock hopping across a stream: I don't know where the next one will be until I get to the rock right before it. It's an open philosophy.

isfj,"Hey everyone,

Just wanted some relationship advice. I met this ISFJ male last year as I was travelling for work, we immediately hit if off and started dating. I was in his city a few times, and we used to go on dates, talk everyday, and he started to become more open and introduced me to friends too.

After about 3 months of dating I asked if he was interested in a relationship, he said he really liked me but couldn't get into one right now as he plans on leaving the city in a few years for grad school. I said alright, but kept hanging out, but in parallel a week after he started to 'hint' that he wanted more by calling me babe, sharing pics of his family, old friends, and invited me to valentines day and all. 

This went on for another 3 months, as corona hit and I got stuck in my city. He proposed doing weekly video calls, watching movies together (netflix), playing online games and said he misses me. Eventually it became too much so i said I can't do this casually anymore, and he said he thinks the same and we began a relationship. 

We got really close after that, continued long-distance, and there were 2-3 small arguments that we resolved quickly (mostly due to communication). Suddenly, due to him going through a trauma he reached out to me saying this isn't working for him (due to long-distance and how he's feeling) and he wants to break up, but because of he really cares for me and likes me he wants to take a break but continue talking. I asked him why, and suggested we try some more and i'll try to visit him during corona once a month or so. I did, and when i went there he was very distant, and when confronted he said he can't do it and me travelling makes him scared about how fast we're going and gives him guilt that I'm willing to do this (and he can't commit like that right now). I asked if we should break up or go on a break, but he said we should break up as a break is kinda weak. I asked him if he was sure, and he wants to keep talking so we keep a window open so we get a chance again maybe. He was insistent on keeping talking and we talked everyday since (its been 3+ months).

About a month back, we went from talking 3-4 times a day to 1-2 times a day but the tone was very similar, him sharing his day, asking questions, etc. Then he tells me he applied for an internship abroad for a few months, and he might be going to grad school in a year.

Then I finally moved to his city, he started using the terms I use (not sure if to show interest, or what), and a few days after arriving he asks if we should meet for coffee whenever i'm comfortable (but only if we're both sure it'll be okay). I said absolutely, and after that he was kinda cold to my responses and said he might be going for a roadtrip the next day and meeting his friend so we can figure some time out. I said sure, to which he said his plan changed and he'll let me know once he's back and if we can meet as he has to meet his friend also. I replied with a no need to rush, we can meet some other time. He ignored that part and responded to my other texts.

Anyway, I'm all super confused. I do feel very strongly for him still, and care about him. But at the same time, I don't think I can continue this. Any idea why he may acting like this?

1. Why would you want to connect so quickly? Did he ask for coffee cause he just wanted to catch up as friends, or maybe he wanted to test something more?
2. Why would he avoid after? Maybe my more excited response made him realize I wanted more and he's avoiding an awkward situation? Or did he see my dating profiles that I had recently created?
3. If i wanted to ask him about interest in rekindling a relationship, how should i?",1607319366

Soon after, he started flirting with my friend so it was safe to assume he wasn't interested. I eventually started to date other people. 

Fast forward a year later, we are in our last year. He slowly starts to flirt with me now? He would seem nervous when we would interact. He would hover for a bit before approaching me. He would tease me. He would compliment my appearance a lot. He was super observant if I had made a small change to my appearance and would ask me about it. He even put his hand on my knee when we went to a dinner with peers. But he never told me how he felt.

I was confused. I definately didn't want to bring anything up since I was rejected before. I just responded kindly and let it ride out to the end of the year. We ended the school year with him avoiding me again.

After high school, I decided to send him a message to see how he was doing. He responded excitedly that he was fine and asked how I was. I responded and then he ghosted üëª.

isfj,"My ISFJ friend and I met at a post-graduate seminar last year. We got along well and saw each other quite frequently due to our shared modules. After classes ended in May, we have only met up a few times in person.

We had dinner together yesterday. \*It was also the first time I have met any friend in months.

Our conversation was a little choppy as I was having a difficult time adjusting to being outside. Most importantly, I felt like I had overshared - I told her I had anxiety disorder growing up, tried therapy over the summer and my family had history of a physical illness).

I have been beating myself up over this. Because it seemed that I had hogged the entirety of our meet-up, without giving her 'airtime'.

From her body language, it seemed like she was okay with listening but I still feel guilty.

I felt like I had drained her of energy, but I really didn't mean for her to act as a 'therapist'. \*I know there's nothing I can do to change the past.

As an ISFJ, would you have mind the oversharing of personal details?",1607262188

I‚Äôm a sophomore in college double majoring in music and biology as well as hoping to add an English minor (we‚Äôll see how that works out). Being a professor seems appealing, but I know there are sides of it that I don‚Äôt know about, from the student perspective. However, I love working with people and enjoyed tutoring my friend in music theory last semester. I don‚Äôt know how much I‚Äôd like being a biology professor since STEM can be so cutthroat and I feel like it could cause imposter syndrome (I‚Äôm already struggling with that). However, I absolutely love English and would be majoring in that if I weren‚Äôt doing biology.

isfj,"I'm living with a narcissistic ENTP father and an unhealthy ISFJ mother. Everyday, they will always got into a fight, even for a simplest thing. My dad is usually the one that will start it. He's also an addict. My mom always in a mentally exhausted state and I really wanted to help her but Idk how. I tried to persuade her to go to a therapist or counselor but she's not really believing in mental health disorder and assumed all of this happened because the god is angry with our siblings not so religious lifestyle. I also advice her to divorce but she have this mindset that she can't live without my father since he's the breadwinner in our house. I also realize she has this martyr like personality which our father and some family members took advantage as well. She have a lot on her plate. Most of the time she'll push her passive-aggressive behaviour on me (since I'm the oldest) and it's somehow took a toll on my mental health as well. 

This happened since I was a toddler. Now, as an adult I really want to help, at least to ease her mental burden a little. Idk what to do anymore since all of my attempts were unsuccessful. I'm afraid if I'm being overtly blunt it will make things worser. Pardon for my English.",1607179981

Recently, we were planning to hang out and she told me she was looking forward to it. On the day we were supposed to meet, she texted me about an hour or two beforehand saying she was feeling sick. She wasn't lying because she canceled other plans for the upcoming few days. Shes better now and its been about a week.


The problems I've had just have to do with her inconsistent texting. I wanted to be a good friend and check up on her every day asking how she was. As she got better, she just stopped responding to me. She's known to be a bad responder but it just kind of hurt when I tried to show that I care.


I feel like even though I try to show her I care, I don't really get the same in return. We've been friends for over a year and I still don't feel like we're that close. She can spends days and days with her boyfriend without any breaks and still not get tired of him. It's really frustrating because I like her as a person but I feel like everytime I try to show any sort of compassion, I just get sidelined by him or for any other reason.


I used to get really mad at her for these sort of things but I've stopped showing it now. I cant say anything negative about her relationship because they're just ""so in love"". They've even been together for over a year and have no complications, arguments, or disagreements. Everything is just content and its strange.


I really like her and I'm friends with her in the first place because I know she has such a hard time making friends. I feel like I'm getting tossed aside for no reason.",1607131105

isfj,"So I'm really shure I'm an isfj, but it seems most behaviors that ISFJs are known for I dont do.  Function stack wise, I think it makes sense, but in practice it falls on its face.  Here's what I mean.

. I am in no way shy.  Shure I'm definitely an introvert, but I absolutely love people.  I will talk to whoever, and quickly make friends.  People say I have an older brother vibe. And generally I'm well liked.  But people who don't like me say I am cold, rude and quiet. or say I'm annoying and obnoxious.

. I am a huge flirt.  So yeah, I think it goes without saying, that ISFJs are known to be reserved when it comes to these things.  But I on the other hand have no problem vocalizing interested and have no problem with the opposite sex as they say.  

.I am a very dominant person.  Strangely enough, I tend to dominate most people without trying.  I simply just appear threatening to most people.  Most try to please me and look cool around me.  I have very high confidence, and tend to vocalize that.  Mostly as jokes, but I do kinda mean it.  

.I struggle with arrogance.  Isfjs are known as humble quiet individuals, but I tend to be different.  I can be insensitive, and accidentally overshadow people who are insecure.  I've even had people get upset with me for being confident.  They said that I was trying to make them feel bad.  It was nothing I said, just that they felt I was to vocal about it.  Like saying thing like ""damn I'm good looking"" and so forth.

.a natural academic.  Strangely I have always felt stupid.  But I soon realized it was all in my head, as I began to pass hard tests with ease, and watched others have to try way harder than me.  For an example, I recently to the ASVAB to join the Navy, and scored a 93.  The average is a 55.  I dont say that to brag. But they wouldn't even offer me the construction job I wanted, because they wanted me in I.T. or intelligence.  I had to pick one.  I also am a deep thinker, and love theorys.

.I love new experiences.  I strive on new things and fun exiting experiences.  I want to see the world, go on adventures and challenge myself physically and mentally.  

.I dont like to play sports.  For the simple reason that I dont want to compete against multiple other people. I prefer to compete with myself.  I do like to compete against others, but one on one.  That's why I got into martial arts.  I can spare a single person. Or multiple. But I get the time to practice it over and over before hand.  

If I'm way off base with thinking I'm an ISFJ, ide love some insight, thanks.",1606944651
isfj,"I would really like to know what You think about it. Every year at my university there is a year-long team project that one must do to complete their first year. Perhaps it is so everywhere, I don't know. Anyway, my team comprises seven people, including students from overseas (I'm one too). Once the project started, everybody talked so little that I just had to say something. So I did. And boy oh boy, it's three months already, and I'm still the one that does most of the talking, despite numerous attempts  to let the others talk. I pause frequently, I ask questions, I even tried to be late once (didn't do it in the end), desperately trying to elicit some talking. They just won't. Or perhaps give an occasional remark, sometimes even more than one sentence. And they do little as well. I have to keep reminding them about deadlines, and push the matters forward so that we don't fall behind. Absences during scheduled meetings are definitely too frequent. I just can't believe it. Was I the one to cause it? Did I somehow smother their willingness to cooperate? How to fix it?

isfj,"In the recent years,  I've been told by family, associates,  and strangers that I am an old soul.  By default, I would shrugged it off and keep on going on with my day. Now, the established definition of an old soul is an individual who is much more mature than age.  In retrospect, I was a rebellious child, but at the age of 7 years old I'd to experienced an unfortunate tragedy event.  After the tragedy,  my rebellious was amplified by 10 and I had ended up committing a crime that could had put me in  jail for the majority of my life. Now, at age 23, all I care about is living a comfortable quiet life and trying to put my past behind me.  


My close associates would usually tell me, ""You're too serious, and just loosen up."" Or "" You're not normal for your age.""  I'd went to parties and strip clubs with two friend's/ coworkers and honestly it doesn't appeal to me.  I love women, but being around that environment for me is nothing new.  There's a old saying, ""same shit, different day.""  Besides, not being interested in partying  and the hookup culture, I want people to reach their own conclusions in life from their own experiences they'll go through.  Yes, I might give you some advice, so I don't see you go through the same heartaches and headaches, but at the end of the day it is up to you to find your own path. At the end of the day we all have free will.


To summarize my post, do you think there is a correlation of people being labeled an, ""old soul"" from experiencing traumatic life events? Including, do you believe the majority of old souls go through a rock bottom experience in one shape or form or it just depends on the individual? I am looking forward to hearing different responses on this subject.",1606485111

isfj,Hi. I'm INFP male and wants to comfort female ISFJ friend. How do i comfort an iSFJ friend who's feeling down because she wants to buy something yet she cant due to some reasons that we have no control of.  She's been feeling down and i don't know what to say or do for her.,1606447440
isfj,"I know a girl who seems like she's Si-dom and inferior Ne but there are a lot of things about her that don't sound like an ISFJ. She used to be shy back in high school even though she joined the cheerleading team. Regardless of this, a lot of people called her shy and quiet, saying things like how they've known her for about a year but she's still quiet. She also said she has (or had since I don't know if she still has it) social anxiety as well as general anxiety (this one I know she still has). 

However now she's in her third year of college and she seems a lot more outgoing. She actively posts what she's doing on Snapchat/Instagram stories, takes many selfies, wears really revealing outfits to raves, records herself making out with friends at the raves, shows herself smoking a Juul on her stories, talks about how sometimes she has an attitude, is in a sorority, has many piercings and tattoos, and even recently created an Only Fans account (not nudes though) so she could get a boob job next year. She also met a friend online via Instagram and was already openly sharing personal information about herself to the girl within the first few days. 

The thing is, I've mentioned a few (not all) of these things when writing a type me post about her and most people answered she's ISFJ. I've seen some clear Si and quite some inferior Ne in her too. When I posted on Enneagram, a lot of people typed her as a 6.

isfj,"Hi my lovely ISFJs, 

Recently I was suspecting that my SO cheated on me.  
I know ISFJ is known for the most loyal type of all MBTI, so I‚Äôm still looking for some hope.

Let me start with a brief appreciation here. you guys are the warmest and most nurturing people I know. I adore you all! I‚Äôve always enjoyed the company of my ISFJ friends. They are kind, sweet, and caring and I just love being around them. Some of the closest friends I look up to the most are ISFJs. They are responsible, giving and never take credit. I admire those qualities and find that attractive.

As an ENFP (27F), I‚Äôm kind of all over the place when I‚Äôm not in a good state, and my sweet ISFJs just always magically get me and give me endless emotional support without even trying. They helped me overcome my anxiety and obsessive thoughts and made me feel more at ease in difficult times. 

Recently, I‚Äôve been exclusively dating an ISFJ (26M) I met online. He‚Äôs the sweetest human being on earth. We complemented each other well. He made me feel safe and appreciated. We decided to get off all the dating sites shortly after we met. We wanted to get to know each other exclusively since we both agreed that it‚Äôs a healthier way to focus on one relationship at a time. 

He didn‚Äôt want me to see anyone else, so I slowly caspered other dates who seemed flaky. He told me that he did the same for me too. We‚Äôre honest about our past and our goals towards our relationship. We also made sure that we‚Äôre always on the same page. 

Things went incredibly well between us in the early stage. We had similar lifestyles and we both wanted to have a long term relationship. We supported and admired each other‚Äôs talent and hoped to start a business together in the future. We‚Äôre both clingy and wanted to hangout all the time. Our value and goals seemed to match. We met each other‚Äôs closest friends and he even introduced me to his mom. We thought this could eventually lead to a good long term relationship.

However, things started to change after I found out a girl he secretly added on Instagram. I jokingly asked him about her and he told me it was someone he shortly dated and had sex with before me a few months ago. He didn‚Äôt even remember her name. Then he blocked her (I didn‚Äôt ask him to do it) We both value loyalty a lot, so his move definitely made me feel even sure about himüòÖ

The next day his ig account was banned for violating some policies. We both assumed that girl reported him. As we‚Äôre trying to reactivate his account. I noticed that he had another secret account that had been accumulating some followers. I didn‚Äôt ask but it had been on my mind for days. Meanwhile, his behaviour started to change. He became less enthusiastic and less responsive. Normally he would invite me to his place during his wfh shift and called me all the time. But recently he‚Äôs always caught up in work. He even refused to answer my phone a couple times.

I started to become very insecure, I had some terrible dating experience before. When guys wanted to withdraw, they tended to do this. There‚Äôs one night before our dates, he seemed flaky. I freaked out and surprise visited his place. I told him that I missed spending time with him. He was slightly upset and asked me to leave shortly we hung. The next couple days, I told him my concern and he promised that nothing had changed. I knew I was a bit impulsive for doing so, and was afraid that I was pushing him away. He wasn‚Äôt mad, instead he held me in his arm and told me that I was overthinking, he was just busy with work. Then he added me to his private account. We both believed that we had a good communication and could resolve any problems. His patient and kindness made me fall for him more. 

I always thought I was the insecure whiny little baby that needed extra attention, until the next morning I found out that girl he blocked changed her profile pic to the breakfast he made on his table....

It was an avocado toast. 

He never knew how to make an avocado toast before I made the first one for him. I was in shook and my heart was completely shattered. I tried to put myself together and stay calm. I called him and asked him if I could come visit. He said he just got off and was really tired. I couldn‚Äôt think straight, so I asked him if he had talked to that girl. He denied.

Then I sent him the screenshot I took. He said it was before we started dating. I assumed that girl was still in his place, so I took an uber to his place again. When I arrived, through the window I saw a toaster and a bag of avocado on the kitchen table. (They weren‚Äôt there before) 

I asked him to get the door for me but he said he wasn‚Äôt home. He‚Äôs at his friend‚Äôs. He asked me to leave or else he‚Äôd call the police lol. I couldn‚Äôt believe that he‚Äôd say such thing to me.. He refused to meet at his place. He suggested us to meet at mine or a random park. He didn‚Äôt want to talk, he just wanted to return my stuff. I didn‚Äôt wait long, cuz I thought it‚Äôs too creepy for me to do so just to get the evidence ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è While I was waiting for my Uber, I saw him opened the door. He probably thought I left. 

We never talked again since then.. 

So, was he cheating with that girl? I have no clue what to do next. 

Please help üíïüò≠

Anyways, I originally thought she guy she was with was an ESFJ but I'm thinking now is another ISFJ, which would make them both the exact same type. Neither of them like to leave that little comfort zone they're in and are very hesitant to try new things or hang out with new people. I personally don't think it's a good idea to be with someone who is that similar to you but I understand ISFJs like this idea of comfort and familiarity.

isfj,"I‚Äôve known my type for several years but my girlfriend just found out about MBTIs last week. We each took a thorough questionnaire to determine our types and both of us were pleased with reading up about our types. Even though I‚Äôve been with her for nearly 4 years and known her for twice that, her type told me so much more about her than I could‚Äôve imagined.

At this point I don‚Äôt care to dispute astrology, you either buy into it or you don‚Äôt (I don‚Äôt but it‚Äôs cool, a lot of people just think it‚Äôs fun). But I really wish that Myers-Briggs types had the same kind of conversational presence that astrological signs do. Can you imagine if people asked your MBTI as readily as they ask your astrology sign?

I have been asked my sign (Capricorn) before and literally watched people grimace or quickly shift attention from me, because the day I was born that I had no control over apparently defines me as a human. Meanwhile, MB types are defined by your own answers to questions that can actually suggest something about your personality, and I have never been asked about it in my life. It‚Äôs only 4 letters, and yet I feel like those 4 letters can instantly tell you so much about a stranger or contextualize things about someone you already know, or vice versa.

Next time somebody asks for my sign, I‚Äôll politely say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a Cap, but I think that my MBTI can tell you a lot more about the kind of person I am.‚Äù Then we can both decide if that‚Äôs what they actually care about.",1606041947

isfj,"So a while ago I met an ISFJ, I'll call C,  we are exchange student and we're both in the same dorm.

She is actually very sociable and very nice, every now and then when we meet, she would ask me how I was and so on. (From my point of view she is like that with everyone, now that I think of it, maybe not, I could not tell, but it's nothing too special so I did not think much of it.)

But well a lot of things happened that I had not picked up on, (She walked with me one on one during a trip because I was walking ahead of everybody as an example)

But recently, we had a talk about mac n cheese, I mentionned liking it a lot, and buying some every week, a few days after that, she mentionned there were none left at the shop (my fault according to her). She then provoked me into cooking mac n cheese for her, to which I did not respond at first, then I realized I was being an idiot, and proceeded to go to the supermarket, bought a LOT of mac n cheese, then wrote her name on one of them, walked to her floor and offered it to her, in person, wanted to just leave it on the table but she was there sooo. 

her reaction : No waaaaay, she was smiling then she said thank you. I had to leave right after. 

A few days/weeks afterwards I asked her if she wanted to eat Mac n cheese with me (one on one), she accepted. 

So we had Mac n cheese, but we weren't one on one before, a friend showed up and did not read the situation properly (Not before I discretly texted him anyway). 

During the ""date"", things were very nice, it was uplifting, but I can't quite call this flirting, it wasn't awkward, rather..cordial? I couldn't get to ask her questions about her, she did ask a lot of things, and shared some things about herself, but I don't think it was getting so personal, I did mention some personal things tho. 

So I wasn't sure it was a date before, and afterwards I was even less.

The following day we had a party, where we talked a bit then she went to dance, I do not dance so I did not follow and talked with other people. 

The day following the party there was another party, but where everyone had to remain sitted to a place they were assigned, and we were far apart so no interaction, everyone was talking right before the party, but she barely adressed me. 

I had to leave very early, basically when the party started, I am subject to some mood disorder, (she knows), and for some reason today it affected me greatly.

And now I'm here writing this post, because i'm really bad at relationships, I overthink everything   

(INTJ), and I don't want to screw this up, she is very lovely. 

I feel super ridiculous right now.

Recently, while talking to her she pointed out that she find most of my questions very difficult to answer (she was laughing when she said it so I didn't take it very seriously)

However, I've noticed that I usually ask her questions that are future-oriented, like what countries would she like to visit, or what would she like to work on in the future. To me this is something natural as I am a very passionate and dreamy person and I am always thinking about the possibilities the future holds, plus I love having deep and meaningful conversations. However she seems to struggle to answer these kind of questions, like for instance, she mentioned that right now she is in no position to travel (she is unemployed plus covid) and that she doesn't really know where she would travel if she had the chance (as if she didn't allow herself to have dreams right now). However after insisting, I got her to open up a little and she admitted that she'd like to see Italy. 

Yesterday, after hanging out she sent me a text saying that she had a great time and that she enjoys the fact that I make her think about things she would not think under normal circumstances. I find this weird as I had the impression that ISFJs are not really into this kind of stuff and I a bit afraid she may get tired of my way of communicating in the long run. 

I want her to be confortable with me so, do you think I should change my approach? What are some topics I could bring up in the conversation? I always had the impression that talking about everyday stuff is boring (I don't find it specially meaningful) but I guess some types really enjoy it?. What is your experience as ISFJ? Is there a common ground for both of us that we could enjoy?",1605968432

An ESTJ coworker I have pals around with a couple ISTPs and speaks his mind without restraint on a variety of things. However, I enter the scene, and it's ""hey, I don't want to offend you, but..."" or if they feel like they went too far with a joke or something, here comes the flood of apologies. I've never reacted in anger or had an emotional outburst to these people or anything to make them feel like they need to walk on eggshells, they just label me as the ""nice guy.""  


I also had an ISTP coworker casually blurt out the F word in conversation with me, but funnily tried to catch himself in the middle of it and change it to ""freak,"" and then apologized stating he ""was tired and wasn't paying attention to what he was saying."" I laughed at him. :)

isfj,"Cognitive functions vibes of enneagram types. I also added some interesting observations and correlations about personality disorders/mental illnesses and information metabolism.

Correlations don't imply causation. Having a certain information metabolism doesn't automatically translate in the individual having specific personality disorders. Rather it indicates that the individual is potentially more suspectible to that specific personality disorders/mental illnesses.

The enneagram (basic motivations), as well as non-typology factors, can influence the individual in how he/she chooses to develop functions. Overall I found out that each jungian type can have 3888 archetypal variants (differerent mix of enneagram elements)... Some combinations are more common, some less.

Overall these differentations can lead to ""pseudo-types"", with the individual appearing to have a different type on surface level. A lot of people mistype themselves initially to the pseudo type. Also a celeb can be easily mistyped superficially to his/her pseudo-type. Be very careful when typing someone!

If you aren‚Äôt interested, that‚Äôs cool. Obviously there‚Äôs no obligation. I‚Äôm sure it would bore some of you and interest others. People are different.

But I‚Äôm down to break down any songs you request. And if y‚Äôall are down for it, I‚Äôll explore more of that artist‚Äôs music and make more videos on their library.

[Here are all the ones I‚Äôve done so far](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKy9JfrMugrK29I52hYQNcwmoYi79_ePx)

As you can see, there‚Äôs a pretty big emphasis on NF. Most of the people who‚Äôve subscribed so far are heavy NF fans, but I‚Äôll continue branching out to other artists, and like I said, I‚Äôm open for requests.

Love y‚Äôall. Take care.

Deep down I want people to take an interest in me for me, not simply for what I can do for them. There are certain people in my life where I only seem to exist to them when they need something, and then when they are done, I go back to not existing. Maybe it's because I'm boring or too shy, or something. Don't know. When you try to be helpful and nice in order to get people to like you and want you around, it doesn't always seem to work out that way I guess and it hurts sometimes.

isfj,"Throwaway here. I have a ISFJ 2w1 SP/so (269) parent who is unhealthy and dysfunctional since I was probably born. My mother uses tertiary TI is to affirm faulty belief systems (ie: if a deadly airplane accident or disaster occurs, it‚Äôs because they weren‚Äôt religious like she is). Her inferior NE also leads her into believing in the science of ‚Äúconscious water‚Äù, deeply believing that electronics have radiation and will affect you in adverse catastrophic ways, stainless steel appliances must made with a specific rating, garlic / shallots / leeks must NEVER be consumed (it‚Äôs a religious thing), diagnosing illnesses from an oversimplified psychosomatic perspective (‚Äúpeople are mentally ill because they didn‚Äôt sleep enough‚Äù). 

Like... usually, Ti has an attitude of ‚Äújust because you state it doesn‚Äôt make it true‚Äù right? But healthy Ti is able to consider many MANY more variables and possibilities as a gradient of truths and, come to a framework of what makes more sense than another. IxFJ‚Äôs unhealthy tertiary TI will overdo TI in a way they /want/ a long-term definitive one-size-fits-all ‚ÄúTI‚Äù roadmap that will accommodate all and every of their SI/NI preferences - now and forever more. Healthy TE and TI on the other hand can accept short term truths and adapt to those changes as needed if this makes sense. 

I‚Äôve grown up with my mom seeing her go through the hoops of presenting herself as helpful, useful and nice and roles of a caretaker and breadwinner, but never working on herself and just losing herself with over identification to social roles. She has a knee-jerk aversion to being open to any of the possibilities and instead sinks further and further in memories 10, 20, 30, more years ago. She lives in an echo chamber of other people who think in this exact way (very little type variation in her social environment - she hates differences in others??) that reaffirm ~Positive Vibes Only And Never Fight UwU~. She has been unemployed for 10 years while being at working age to volunteer full-time while living purely through my INTP sibling‚Äôs income.... lol. 

I thought my ISFJ parent being around my INTP sibling would help with her lack of TI, but my INTP sibling became avoidant of any touchy subjects to prevent ‚Äústepping on the mines‚Äù with ISFJ, never confronting out of annoyance and pretending to adjust on the outside. (IE: my INTP sibling isn‚Äôt vegan but adjusted to a vegan diet since ISFJ parent has a specific way of belittling and guilt tripping others by bringing up a topic over and over again) 

This just pushes others away ya know? I‚Äôm not around my mother and I live in a separate continent entirely. I‚Äôve learned to never share anything I do, i.e. my hobbies. I like to paint but she would have opinions on paints being dangerous. I like to cosplay but she would have opinions on materials being cancerous and being bad. I like to play drums but she‚Äôd have opinions on that too. I like to cook but she gets triggered by the food that she doesn‚Äôt like. I like to bike but grew up with her screaming what a bad idea that is. And after all this she always asks why others don‚Äôt talk to her or share things with her........ and doesn‚Äôt get it‚Äôs because of her lack of boundaries, that‚Äôs why. 

I wrote here mostly to vent (which is why I didn‚Äôt include my type lmao), not really to bash the ISFJ type........

I feel quite stuck and I'm asking you guys as a group for advice as I feel you may understand more than anyone else, aswell as I feel anonymous. I also don't want to sell a kidney for a therapist, and I don't feel comfortable talking to any friends or family about this.

I(M) have been with my partner(F) for 5 and half years. We get along for the most part but I have just been feeling an extreme lull the last few months. We don't share any interests, hobbies, don't like the same music or movies, it almost seems like we should probably have never got this far to start with.

I love her but that 'spark' seems to have gone. We live like flatmates, getting the chores done and working and sleeping. With little to no shared interests, I don't think the Spark will come back.

We nearly seperated 6 months ago, her devastation of the whole thing was too hard on me and I also struggled to see life without her. We ended up staying together but she has big life goals of buying a house, marriage and children.

We bought a house 4 months ago which we are in now, and her next step is to have children/get married. I just can't go through with either of them if this spark is missing, it seems pointless.

We have spoke about this more than once, of what each party needs in the relationship but we both comply with some things and then revert after a small amount of time, almost like we both can't change each other. But looking at it I think, why should we change each other? Shouldn't we just find people that suit us as we are?

I feel like there are only 2 options,

Option 1 is we stay together, everything goes on as normal except I live a life I didn't want, but everyone else is happy.

Option 2 is we seperate, I ruin her and probably myself a bit, lose family and friends, we go through all the crap of selling the house and all the stuff, and then I'll likely be alone for a long time after (I struggle to meet new people).

So both options suck, but option 1 makes me the only collateral damage and I'm living like that now, but inside I feel  absolutely miserable.

Any advice appreciated, I may not be able to reply to all but thanks in advance.",1605026505

This is a sample of the body language signals that you can usually see in an ILI/INTJ. 

For the analysis I used as an example the actress Aubrey Plaza (ILI/INTJ 6 sp/sx). She is one of the few ILI/INTJ women around (LIE/ENTJ and ILI/INTJ are the rarest types in women).

4D valued Base/Dominant Ni is by definition (apex of the ego) fully conscious in an ILI/INTJ. The other 3 valued functions (Te Creative/Parent, Fi Mobilizing/Child, Se Suggestive/Inferior) might showcase different levels of consciousness on the body mannerism. Occasional mixed  signals, especially related to 4D unvalued Demonstrative/Critics Ti, might be possible.

Whilst VI is useful, keep in mind that the body language can be controlled at will, modified by moods as well as it can be susceptible to feedback  when interacting with others. Most individuals don't know how to control body language and/or they will usually resort to using the default body mannerism as it's the least energy expensive option. 

Anyways counter-check the information metabolism by IM/functions slots just to be sure:

\-------

ILI/INTJ

Ego: (+ Ni) 4Dv Base/Dominant, (-Te) 3Dv Creative/Parent.

Superego: (- Fe) 1Du Vulnerable/Trickster, (+ Si) 2Du Role/Demon.

Superid: (+ Fi) 2Dv Mobilizing/Child, (- Se) 1Dv Suggestive/Inferior. 

Id: (- Ne) 3Du Observing/Nemesis, (+ Ti)  4Du Demonstrative/Critics.

Socionics quadra: Gamma (world rejecting, integrity seeking).

&amp;#x200B;

(+ Ni) = constraining own hot temper, these sociotypes prefer to advance gradually into the future, though may sharply reject obsolete ideas, criticizing past mistakes. Advancing step by step,  generally believes in the linearity of development, i.e. according to own deep convictions, it is only necessary to remove obstacles, remnants of the past, and immediately this will open endless possibilities for growth. This quadra is not afraid of chaos and upheavals due to knowing how to conduct own work under conditions of change, risk and confusion.

Hidden agenda: 2Dv (+ Fi) Mobilizing/Child (to love)

Socionics communication style: Cold-blooded.

isfj,"Hi all, just your typical INFP who wants to understand the inner workings of the ISFJ (she sent me her results). The thing is that she is straight, I'm not and we both work together. Yes I realise, 'do not go there' for all these reasons but I need perspective from all you lovely ISFJs. 

When she first joined the company and I was getting to know her, she asked me a flurry of questions and added me to her social media. We eventually hang out the one time and then messaged me after. I'm not interested in guys and she said that's cool as she is straight but has plenty of friends who are gay. Anyway, to fast forward a long story, it's been a year. In that time I've asked her to coffee/places as a friend but she always says I'll let you know/maybe later. She invited me to her birthday night out and cancelled. So I took the hint and have stopped asking. We don't message very much now and I've left her alone because she couldn't be interested right? She says one thing and then her actions say another. 

Well, at work she gives me longing looks and smiles warmly. She always asks how I am, was interested in my dating life when I was venting to my coworker about nobody appreciating who I am (that was a low point!). She has told me really personal stuff and vents a lot to me as I listen. She is going through a rough time at the moment and I have been supportive as I care for her. One day, she randomly messages me out of nowhere for a coffee and I say yes. The day before she cancels citing illness. But promised she would be free the following week. I see her at work a few days later and ask about her being free, she shakes her head. I ask not at all? Because she did mention being free and she just says nothing and then says maybe next week! That rejection hurt and I'm now keeping my distance again. It took me all my courage to ask and she shut me down. 

I'm really at a loss. I feel like I'm just someone she likes venting to at work to pass time. Thoughts?",1604918509

He is a private guy, but is very open with me and has told me he will be an open book with me.

We used to work together and all of the subtle signs that he liked me slowly became incredibly obvious.  We no longer work together, and I have gone from being ‚Äúseparated‚Äù to getting divorced.  I recently reached out to see if he wanted to stay in touch and stay friends and told him how much his kindness meant to me (my ex had a lot of anger issues and was emotionally abusive, amongst other things). He said ‚Äúthat would be awesome‚Äù and I was impressed that he was usually initiating text conversations at first.  But then he seemed to sort of pull back.  If I didn‚Äôt text first now, I don‚Äôt know if he would. 

So as a typical INFJ, I stressed and overthought **everything**.  I finally decided to text him yesterday after not talking for almost 2 weeks. I wasn‚Äôt sure if he wanted to talk, but he always responded (within 10-20 minutes). When it was a topic he was into, he had a lot to say.  It was nice to go beyond just surface-level ‚Äúwhat did you do today?‚Äù stuff. Afterwards, I realized we had texted back and forth for 5 hours (which has happened once or twice before). 

So I‚Äôm thinking maybe he is still interested. ???

Maybe he‚Äôs overthinking things, too. I was the one who said ‚Äústay friends‚Äù so I think I sort of friend-zoned him. Maybe he wonders how I feel about him. Maybe he worries he would just be a rebound. I want to get to know him better, and start as friends but I am very open to the possibility of it becoming something more. When we were together at work, it was easy to tell how he probably felt by his actions. Now, I have no idea, and it‚Äôs sort of driving me crazy.

isfj,"Hello! I'm in a bit of a bind and I'm trying to understand my ISFJ manager's behavior towards me.

I've been working at the company I'm at for about three months and my manager at this job is my age. He's very sweet (to me, he's like that with people he enjoys....he can be pretty ruthless socially to people he doesn't like...that protectiveness) and we get along super well - I love working with him in spite of our very different views and ideas about certain things, we line up really well personality wise and on other certain views/ideas.

The trouble is, I'm trying to figure out if he likes me. I like him, which is tough since he's technically my superior. Some things he's done:

* He initiates conversation with me quite a bit...not all the time, but we almost always end up going into pretty deep conversation about his life and he tells me all sorts of stories; one last weekend he said he hadn't spoken to anyone except his ex girlfriend about
* Offered to (and followed through on) changing the tail light to my car (he initiated this by offering...met me at the store to buy the tail light and then installed it in the parking lot
* Went on a two day vacation with me to the beach and split the cost with me entirely (I initiated and he came along)

I guess I'm confused because he hasn't been direct, which I have been told/read is in the ISFJ nature. I also wonder if he is thinking about me being his subordinate. He was openly complimenting me and flirting with me for a week or two then that died down because I didn't know how to take him and I wasn't reciprocating really. But he began doing practical things for me. He offers to bring me coffee to work, although he does that with the other girl who works there too.

We had a lot of relationship issues such as my self-sabotaging tendencies and possessiveness, and her not being able to prioritise people and activities in her life properly, often obsessing over one activity or social group, abandoning the rest. She also found it hard to understand my needs and would often brush them aside, triggering my anxiety. The I'd confront her about it and we'd fight. She would also put in less effort towards the second half of the relationship, and when I matched her levels of engagement she'll freak out, which I thought wasn't fair because how can you put in 50% effort and expect 100% from the other party. Horrible cycle, I know. 

Over the last few days of the relationship she said she understood we're too different and came across as cold, then as we talked she asked to sit next to me and hugged my arm and we began making out. She said she loved me a lot and doesn't want it to end. We were enjoying each other's company and we talked about how if we could have done it all over again we would and how we really wanted it to work, this gave me a change of heart and I was willing to try again. You know ENTPs and possibilities.

But then she started looping, saying things like if it was for her, she'd stay with me, but it was selfish, and because she loves me she wants to end it. I wanted to believe her but its genuinely hard to because this is often what exes say to pad the break up. She was in a lot of emotional distress and kept saying she doesn't think she can change and had a panic attack. She said she was torn between continuing and ending it. 

The next day, I tried convincing her we could try again but she was crying and said she can't. She said she doesn't think its fair to me to be with someone who cannot prioritise them the same way and said she doesn't know if she can change her patterns. This left me feeling very down because she didn't want the same thing to me. 

We did not contact each other for 2 months, then I reached out. She replied my first text, seemed out of courtesy then ignored my second. Does this mean she's moved on? 

What I don't understand is if she's genuinely doing this for me or if she just doesn't want it, and it makes it hard for me to accept its over when I don't know if she told me how she truly feels. I don't know what's the real reason she doesn't want it, and her not knowing herself and her pattern of not communicating just makes it hard for me to believe whatever she's said.

He laughed when I told him and It‚Äôs been crickets ever since lol. I didn‚Äôt mean to ruin things but I just had to shoot my shot while I still could. Is this normal isfj male behaviour?",1604265110

A lot of the times I notice that whenever I ask them a question, they tend to avoid it or answer it in reallyyy vague terms so as not to give any answer at all. I don't think we aren't close enough for them to feel uncomfortable and the questions are never too personal, just some get-to-know-each-other things.

isfj,"I went on two dates with an ISFJ girl last week and I decided that I wanna pursue her. The thing is, I‚Äôm an INTJ girl and I find it really hard to initiate and flirt during our dates. Instead, I try to text her everyday (but not too often because I‚Äôm scared I will come off as annoying), make her laugh during our conversations, remember details about her and bring them up, and ask her to hang out frequently. She‚Äôs even less initiative than I am. I think it‚Äôs obvious enough that I like her?

She replies my texts quickly and she‚Äôs also interested in hanging out with me more but she‚Äôs leaving the city for a month or so soon. My gut says that she likes me but I‚Äôm so stressed because I don‚Äôt know if she likes me as much as I like her. And because I don‚Äôt know how to flirt, I can‚Äôt tell at all if she‚Äôll return my touches, kiss, etc. I know most ppl move quickly during dates but I think I prefer to go slightly slower, and make sure she‚Äôs comfortable before I initiate anything, especially when it‚Äôs covid.

I‚Äôve read up all about dating girls and I feel like it‚Äôs illogical for me to focus on someone who may not even be that into me. But it‚Äôs also really hard for me to divide my attention because once I like someone, I *only* think about them all the time.

I also don‚Äôt think that MBTI is 100% reliable and I don‚Äôt care how incompatible the INTJ/ISFJ pairing is. I have liked other types (INFP, INFJ, ENTP, INTJ) and was hurt by them even though they‚Äôre supposedly better for me. I like her because she‚Äôs the most gorgeous girl I‚Äôve ever met. Other than that, I had a really good vibe from our dates and I need more time to think about what attracts me to her.

Idk what I should do. I‚Äôm thinking of setting up a third date with her before she leaves and then texting her until she comes back. ISFJs, how do y‚Äôall show interest in someone and do you feel chemistry over texting? ISFJs with INTJs SOs, how are your interactions like?",1604131256

1) what is your daily struggle (not a situational issue, one that you feel is because of your MBTI type.)

2) do you try so set aside quiet time for yourself? If so, what do you see start to happen if you do not get this.

3) what type of things make you appreciate life kn a regular basis. (Depression does not play a part in this question, it is asking what things do you notice and enjoy)

If you would be so kind as to answer each question thoroughly I am interested to read all detailed responses.  
The motivation behind this, is that I've noticed a pattern in myself, that if I not recognize these things daily I bottle up my sadness, or whatever it may be, and save it up until I explode.  

Side note, the third question is not to be insensitive, it was a question to evoke the reality that there is good even in a crappy situation.

isfj,"This is mostly to make a record so I dont forget what he said, but it struck me as something I think other ISFJ's might identify with?

I took a questionnaire on irrational thinking and basically I scored high on being a perfectionist people pleaser.

We did this exercise where he asked me to name a scenario that left me feeling sad sometimes, and one that made me anxious. Then he had me realize those situations didn't cause my feelings, it was the fact that I associated those events with false criticisms of myself (I'm worthless, I'm not a good person, I'm stupid) and it created a cycle of anxiety and depression.

Then he did an exercise with me where he crumpled up a tissue and handed it tome along with a critical statement (""You're worthless, etc) and I kept taking the tissues and as I was collecting a handful, he asked me ""Why do you keep taking these tissues? Why do you keep accepting these terrible statements about yourself?"" and I was legitimately puzzled and kind of stammered out, ""I don't know...."" and he said ""because that's just what you do!""

Next week we're going to go over how to combat this and he said I have to change the way I think and realize these events are unfortunate events but are not catastrophes, not permanent, and not reflective of myself as a person.

Thinking on it, it just seemed to me like a very ISFJ trait, or at least it is for those of us who aren't as stable as we should be. We always want to protect the ones we care about and we don't want to disappoint our teams at work, school, etc so we end up internalizing everything and shouldering all the responsibility, and then all the blame even if we know we don't have to.",1603931543

For every positive activity that you are doing, try to have a 2 minute version of it.

* Writing: My 2 Minute Version would be opening up my laptop and writing one new sentence

I thought the Fi were the artists, cuz they try to express their Fi through creative ways, while on the other hand the Fe is more just naturally expressive with people in the real world, so there's not as much point to art. I wish I was really good at art, but unfortunately I'm not that passionate about it. I am better than average though cuz of practice. But then I see Fi people do art and all the effort they put into it, even if it may not be technically good, at least it means something to them.

I think art is cool and I want to be good but beyond that I don't have that much passion for it. I was wondering if it's worth pursuing though in the long term, cuz I do like being good at things.

An overview of the gamma quadra in socionics (model A)/MBTI. The delta quadra types are SEE (in MBTI ESFP), ILI (in MBTI INTJ), LIE  (in MBTI ENTJ) and ESI (in MBTI ISFP).

(- Fi)  = Minimization of negative relationships and experiences. Critical of evil. Desire to get away from bad people and poor relationships, as well as to protect themselves from enemies and adversaries. 

(- Te)  = Business logic of risk and entrepreneurship. Rejection of which is useless, insignificant, mundane. This aspect is valued as more important than accumulation and rational consumption. 

(+Se) = Well capable of defending itself and its position. Protectiveness. Ability to defend themselves against all force. Ability to retain that which was acquired. Social mission of purification (to be understood in both the literal and the figurative sense of the word). Restorers of distorted principles, doing all that's necessary to remove barriers and obstacles which limit rapid advancement. This quadra can be called the quadra of criticism and reform. 

(+ Ni)  = constraining their hot temper, these sociotypes prefer to advance gradually into the future, though they may sharply reject obsolete ideas, criticizing past mistakes. Advancing step by step, they generally believe in the linearity of development, i.e. according to their deep convictions, it is only necessary to remove obstacles, remnants of the past, and immediately this will open endless possibilities for growth. This quadra is not afraid of chaos and upheavals: they know how to conduct their work under conditions of change, risk and confusion.

ILI/INTJ +Ni -Te

isfj,"It‚Äôs no secret that habit building can be hard. I‚Äôm constantly experimenting with ways to make adoption of better habits a little more seamless for myself. And then, I was introduced to a concept called habit stacking.

Habit Stacking follows the principle that it‚Äôs always easier to practice new habits by attaching them to the tail-end of an existing one. This is formula that you have to bear in mind:

After \[CURRENT HABIT\],

I will \[NEW Habit\]

You‚Äôre essentially taking your willpower out of the equation by following a routine of practices, and can even have stacks on top of stack, If you prefer. It leveraged the power of using a routine to add on new habits and follow it through muscle memory. For example:

After I wake up in the morning, I meditate for 15 minute.

After I meditate for 15 minutes, I workout for an hour.

After I workout for an hour, I handle email and other tasks.

This has even been discussed by James Clear in his bestseller *Atomic Habits* and explains that this is a great way of tapping into the way that our neurons and brain in programmed. I explain this in depth here with examples - [https://youtu.be/7yTQPPW3cQE](https://youtu.be/7yTQPPW3cQE).

The order I would follow would likely be questions about school (ex: what major they are), what their hometown is, and how their day was... but what can I say other than that? Sorry, this is something I struggle with a lot and I figured some other people may have also struggled with it in the past and have some insight. Thanks!",1602981957
isfj,"Hi, my first post around here! (I feel it's the wrong subreddit but I do try anyway)

I recently joined a group of discord with the intention of making friends, but at first I pulled out my protective and uncomfortable side by not knowing how to get the talk out. So, as time went by, I saw that most people speak in another group on whatsapp but I still want to integrate well because I feel that they have already left that uncomfortable idea of me. I also want to get along with everyone but no one talks chat and I do not know what to put without looking bad.

What do you suggest?",1602981850
isfj,"23 female here. Let me give an example: when a friend comes over, I impulsively offer them the best that I can give. I worry that it‚Äôs too formal I guess. I want then to feel at ease but I feel like they don‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt even know if I‚Äôm making sense. When someone comes to me, I just can‚Äôt just stay there and be all cool like ‚Äúyou can do what ever you want, I will be here on my phone if you need me to do something‚Äù. 

I recently moved to France for studies and I just can‚Äôt seem to make friends. To be honest I don‚Äôt like the effort I have to make to keep a friend; talk to them constantly, go out with them, tag along with them, etc. I feel like I could put that effort into something that I actually want to do. I know I am gonna be fine without a friend but I have lived this way for so long and I want to meet new people make new friends. 
I am extremely introverted. I have almost nothing to say to people the first few times I meet them. These days almost everyone I meet are talkative and loud (when I say loud I mean it in a literal sense) and I just can‚Äôt seem to keep up with them and since I don‚Äôt have much to say I become invisible. French people are very opinionated and they love talking about almost anything. Once this classmate I have sat on my table in the cafeteria (cause there was no empty table other than mine) and talked to me about what he ate this noon (!!!!!!). I nodded the whole time he talked. I made a friend who I thought was like me but she recently made new friends and turns out she is the opposite of what I thought she was. She does not need space, she loves talking, she feels uncomfortable when people are silent. 

What am I suppose to do to get a friend?",1602963765

An overview of the beta quadra in socionics (model A)/MBTI. The beta quadra types are EIE (in MBTI ENFJ), LSI (in MBTI ISTP), SLE  (in MBTI ESTP) and IEI (in MBTI INFJ).

(+Fe)  = maximization of positive emotions. Even small doses are enjoyed. Against the backdrop of the dramatic, turbulent emotions that always accompany this quadra, every small occurrence deserving a positive response is seen as an occasion for joy and uplifts their spirits.

(+Ti)  = organizational logic. They have a developed sense of duty, citizenship, and loyalty to the elected project. It is therefore the most disciplined and organized quadra that knows how to quickly rally its forces in the event of imminent danger or emergency situations.

(- Se)  = minimization of weaknesses, i.e. steadfastness in the struggle against deprivation and resistance against the enemy. In this quadra, the force of will is an indispensable condition for effective operation. Persistence, determination, endurance, and firmness are always the supreme authority.

(- Ni)  = desire to bypass danger. They aim to avoid previously committed mistakes. In their groups, experience, skill, know-how, and sophistication are highly valued. They feel confident in extreme situations.

&amp;#x200B;

EIE/ENFJ +Fe -Ni

LSI/ISTP  +Ti -Se 

SLE/ESTP -Se +Ti

IEI/INFJ   -Ni +Fe 

&amp;#x200B;

Hidden agendas:

EIE/ENFJ (Se Mobilizing): To be wealthy.

LSI/ISTP (Ni Mobilizing): To believe.

SLE/ESTP (Fe Mobilizing): To be loved.

IEI/INFJ (Ti Mobilizing): To understand.",1602759658

Essentially, I‚Äôve always picked up on the tiniest of details from situations that most people wouldn‚Äôt ever notice. Based on those minor details, im able to quickly come up with a list of possible conclusions in my head that could explain those unusual details. As a result of sensing that somethings off about a person, I tend to distance myself and stay cautious while around this person as I trust my gut feeling which acts a sort of shield to protect me from getting hurt. Because of this, I‚Äôve always jumped to negative conclusions about people much earlier than most other people. The people around me eventually come to the same conclusion as me, but it usually takes several months after and several shady encounters for them to realize that somethings off.

isfj,"Hey ISFJs! I'm Derek (ENTJ). A few months ago, my friends and I created an MBTI-based dating/friends app called Boo. Some of you may have already heard of it (and know that our first version was actually barely usable). I wanted to let you know about it because we've made a lot of improvements since then and thought you'd be interested in trying it out.

Like many of us, we're hardcore MBTI lovers and enthusiasts and thought it strange that no MBTI app existed yet. We thought MBTI could fix a few problems with current dating apps.

For one, you are recommended people you‚Äôre statistically likely to love and understand effortlessly, instead of being forced to meet every single type of person. Second, you can save time, money, and emotional fatigue you would have spent on bad dates with no chemistry on other dating apps. Third, you can deeply understand each other‚Äôs personalities before you meet and in a way that was never possible before. And fourth, get in-depth dating advice and insight into how to attract and get along with anyone.

[Boo Telepathy Demo](https://i.redd.it/30kp1b1s3vs51.gif)

Many of our users are using the app to make friends and foster deeper, more meaningful connections. We pretty much built this app for people like us, so I'd love to get your feedback on how we can make it better.

The app is completely free to use, with added features like Dating Telepathy that are part of a premium membership (to support our operations).

You can download the app through the Apple App Store and Google Play Store links on our website: [https://boo.dating](https://boo.dating/)

Whilst VI is useful, keep in mind that the body language can be controlled at will, modified by moods as well as it can be susceptible to feedback when interacting with others. Most individuals don't know how to control body language and/or they will usually resort to using the default body mannerism as it's the least energy expensive option.

isfj,Currently feeling a tremendous sense of guilt for not doing more to help a friend two months ago. This happened right when I was in the middle of moving 6 hours away. I intended to do more but time slipped away from me and now its already mid-October. I guess I'm not sure how to help this person and so it was easier to just do nothing.

isfj,"Hi I have a ISFJ capricorn male friend for 4 years and in the last 3 months, he started video calling me for about 1-2h at least once every 2 weeks, before he sleeps (he will ask me work related questions and he will continue with personal topics later) - is this a sign that he is interested? He didn't have the habit of calling me before though we were good friends.However, there are times where we won't message each other for a week until me/him takes the initiative - so really confused by the mixed signals and any help will be well appreciated :) What are some signs that an ISFJ guy is interested and does ISFJ guys tend to call his female friends?

isfj,"So for the longest time I thought I was an INTJ because that is what I got when I took personality tests. Growing up I thought it was a good idea to take different personality tests at different ages to see if I got the same type...always INTJ. 

I spoke to someone who was very into the mbti and said that at first she thought I was INFJ which threw me for a loop then said I was an ISFJ which spun me again. 

I see that there is a stereotype like these types while caring can be pushovers and victims, who are rigid and traditional to a fault. I do not see myself in these stereotypes, this is partially why I felt disconnected from being an ISFJ.

Also wanted to state that I do not place a really large amount of importance on the mbti. Growing up it always intrigued me so I read more into it.

Anyway, what stereotype of the ISFJ do you not fit into?",1602561710

isfj,"hello!! i (INFJ) recently started dating this wonderful ISFJ and we were both very attracted to each other (he was fresh out a relationship that was about 2 years, a few months back) - we are both we both decided to go on a date, and before the date came we talked endlessly on text, called each other every night just to talk too, i manage to get him to open up to me and talk to me, and he admitted himself that he felt really comfortable with me as i didn‚Äôt pass any judgement and listened intently. the date was a casual dinner and stroll around the area just talking about anything and everything! and at the end of the night he told me that he really enjoyed himself as did i. 

but after the date, he became a little distant, and started replying more slowly and i got the hunch that he probably wasn‚Äôt that into me. but a few days later he told me he wasn‚Äôt ready to be in a relationship, he didnt want to destroy our friendship and he was still hurt from his previous relationship (his ex ended things because he wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúambitious enough‚Äù) he wanted us to stay friends ‚Äúfor now‚Äù which i‚Äôm quoting from him, and i hope i‚Äôm not reading too deep into that. 

i told him i‚Äôm happy that he told me this straight and that i welcome friendship with him - i also mentioned that i wanted to help him in his recovery and that i would wait for him. 

i just wanted to gain some insights from y‚Äôall fellow wonderful complex beings - did i do the right thing by wanting to wait for him? am i being too pushy? or should i leave him alone?",1602550595

Is this common? Or is he maybe an ESTJ? He only took the test because I asked him to and typed ISFJ. He does say he likes helping people, which is quite ISFJ.

I was heartbroken. I told her that I would do everything I could to make sure we could work, and that I‚Äôd work on myself. 

I went a little overboard at first with letters, gifts, etc... they never worked to build that attraction back she needed. 

Fast forward to a month ago, and some drama regarding a random person I never knew happened. She blocked me on everything, assuming that I WAS behind it. My INTJ brain literally can‚Äôt handle her thinking that of me (I have proof that i had nothing to do with it), so I Venmoed her 1 cent to message her and ask her what happened. 

How do I open that line of communication? Should I tell her how I feel and how much this is bothering me? Or should I be casual? Should I make an alternate account and talk to her on DMs and basically ask ‚Äúwtf‚Äù? Should I be nice about it? 

I just don‚Äôt get it. we were so close, I thought we were getting married. 8 months after the breakup and I still can‚Äôt ever see myself loving someone like that. 

At the end of the day, I think she‚Äôs worried it‚Äôll go back to how it was. But I can promise you I‚Äôd do anything for this girl, and I‚Äôve made so many character improvements.

isfj,"Hello people
So I've been trying to type myself for a while now and I might be an isfj but I need some help. I relate to a lot of the characteristics but what's making me unsure is the taking care of people part.
Like yes if I can help someone out I'm happy to do so but I'm very selective about the people I actually feel protective of. I have a small group of close friends plus my family that I feel the need to take care of, but if some person in my class that I don't actually know is going through a rough time I don't really want, or have the social ability, to comfort them without acting a bit, uh, indifferent, in lack of a better word.

I used to have a really unhealthy habit of trying to fix everyones problems when I was younger, which in the end made me a bit depressive so I learned to not invest myself too much into other people's issues so yeah that's probably why I distance myself now.

Anyway can you guys help me?",1602518219

isfj,"My cousin is an ISFJ and I‚Äôm a ISTP, we‚Äôre both females.( not that it really matters). We have a good relationship overall but we only see each other a couple times a year. This is just what I think/know about her so far. 

She is quite logical and a lot of her reasonings are similar to mine, so we agree on a lot of things. Honestly, her thinking process and conclusions had me thinking she was an T at first instead of an F. She was not what I thought an ISFJ would be like.

She is also not outwardly feely/emotional at all, rarely gets mad and can actually be insensitive at times. Good at reading situations, very responsible, very observant, likes to make sure everyone is taken care of. Has anxiety when interacting with new people, can be reluctant to try new things, can also be pretty judgmental, makes Self deprecating comments often, good with kids, wants to be productive but has procrastination problem. 

As I mentioned we get along for the most part but I find that she likes to make a lot of incorrect assumptions about me or just other things in general sometimes which makes me quite annoyed. Refuses to listen to my reasonings sometimes and just writes it off as me thinking I‚Äôm always right. 

Anyways she‚Äôs a great person in the end and the negatives are only a minor part of our relationship. She‚Äôs a smart and kind person and I‚Äôm glad to have her in my life, one of the only people who I share  really personal stuff with. 

I‚Äôm curious as to what ISFJs think of ISTPs, if you‚Äôve ever encountered or interacted with them before then please share your thoughts.

isfj,"ENTP here, everything I tell my brother seems to disinterest him. How can I ever find a common topic?",1602446439
isfj,"Hello everyone !   


This will serve as a conclusion of a story I bored you all to death with. But I took my time to ""connect"" with my feeling, which is something very hard to do as an ENTP.   
And I just want you guys opinion to make sure I'm not mistaken in anything as it is .... dear to my heart ...   


I met this girl that I instantly connected with, she felt it as well. I felt like I was with someone I've known my whole life. Except there was this ""ghost of her past relation"" that ended not so long ago and was 8 year long, so nearly 1/3 of her life. It seems the relation wasn't healthy and it ended because it was long overdue but feelings were still lingering. (Maybe some ""Ne"" outburst because she felt like ""This or that could have fix the relation maybe I should try it"" ?)

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short she ended up by going back to him. During the first period (when she needed time), I was comprehensive. Then she said she wanted to be alone, still answered with kidness, when she acted like she was missing me but still hesitating, I did the same and now that she told me she went back to him because she ""felt that their story wasn't over"" I did the same. I wished her happiness for I never wanted anything else for her.   


This might be very boring, but as she was a very serious girl. For the first time in my life I was down to do things seriously from the start. And so I did. I fought against my very ""nature"" to answer with kidness, with empathy and I was already down to meet her family and stuff when she'd ask for it (because she already spoke about it). I might be 26 but I always eluded that part before, I couldn't feel too much ""trapped"". But she felt different, she instantly felt like home and thus I could be naturally myself, I could keep at bay my ""fear of abandonment"".   


Now she is obviously gone and while I'm still thinking in some parts of my mind that she could come back if the ""last tentative of fixing the relation"" doesn't work, I already started dating again to not ""linger"" too much in that. I know myself and I know I'm weak against hope and remorses.   


I just wanted to be sure that given those informations I did not do anything wrong to an ISFJ eyes. Was it really a good idea to act with such kindness ? Doesn't it make seem as if ""I didn't really care about her"" ?   


I know people tends to like those who do not pursue them but I just need other's insights that I took the right decision..  


So... was my path the right one ?

isfj,"So a few months ago me and my brother began playing uncharted 4 for the first time after binging the trilogy. I came severely close to finishing the game before hanging out with him one weekend, where I announced that I would go into the other room so him and his girlfriend could finish the game when they got to the part I left off on. This baffled them as I believe them to be ENFP and ISFP with Ne and Se respectively. My reasoning was wanting to finish the game on my own time, on my account so I wouldn't have to finish it yet again and let that annoying lack of a trophy sit there. Eventually I gave in, which makes me wonder about decider functions as well, but I digress.

Any other ISFJs know of any careers that cater to our organization skills? I love organizing, writing emails, researching, investigating, documenting, gathering info, helping from the background. I enjoy quiet environments where I can typically be left with tasks to accomplish independently with support if needed. 

Downsides to me: I‚Äôd rather not be in the public eye as much as possible if I can avoid it, physical jobs seem to drain me as I am most physical outside of work. Deadlines are my WORST nightmare along with pressure of life or death situations (aka no nursing here).

isfj,"Good day to you, and hope you're having a fantastic morning, or evening.  To get some quick things out if the way, I is an ISFJ dude, and honestly really love this community.  

So as the title states, I have been curious about MBTI and dateing.  I have been into mbti for maybe three years, but havnt learned much about how this affects relationships.  I always feared it would affect my dateing life if I somehow got it in my brain that because I read on some site that ISFJs dont work well with say an ENTJ, then I would be bias.  

Also, disclaimer, this is going to be long, so dont get to Invested in this if you hate reading.  

As a topic, I wanted to here some opinions, and maybe even  discuss some things regarding dateing, and MBTI.  

After dateing and just meeting people in general, I have a general grasp of what I look for in a partner.  I have never listed out dateing requirements before. But I will do so in the name of MBTI.  

1) [nerdy]  What I mean by this, is that I like someone who's a little quirky, or on the socially awkward side.  It's kinda weird.   But I find it incredibly cute, and fun.  Also intellectual  sofisticaton is something I need out of a partner.  I love deep conversations and someone to share my poetry and art with, as well as see and discuss what literature and hobbies they have.

2) [likes to be taken care of]  I think this is an ISFJ thing.  But I feel like some people just want to take care of themselves all the time.  I like indipendance, but I will feel useless if I am not providing and looking after my girl.

3) [cozy to be around]  by this I mean a girl who would enjoy long coddling and talks over tea.  Or going hiking or whatever.  But just someone who makes me feel like I'm hers and I would never worry if she loved me.  

4) [a dreamer]  I strangly realized about myself, I have a crazy adventurous side, and I would greatly appreciate a girl who would go along with me and be by my side.  I recently decided to enlist in the navy, but have not gone to boot camp because of covid.  I hope to be a navy diver, so alot of traveling would be involved.  I think this also goes hand in hand with being creative and open.  With I hope to find.  

5) [genuine]  last one, I promise.  Being who I am, I easily see through people who are fake.  Being yourself is very important to me, because that's the best thing you can be.

So I know that was long, and a little superficial or fantastical.  But my enneagram is 4, so can you really blame me ;).  

So my question is does a type like this exist, and if so what type would you say that is. This is of course just my ideals, so dont think I'm holding people to some unrealistic standard. No body is perfect, and I know that.  And that's what makes people unique.  

One last side note.  I realized I get along super well with INTPs and INFPs for some reason.  

Hope this was Interesting to you.  And I'm so excited to here some feedback.  

God bless, and peace.",1602291176

isfj,"How do you tame the anxiety inferior Ne exposes you to in times of newness, stress, and heightened emotional anxiety?

For example, serial job hopping. I get the worst imposter syndrome. My Ne goes wild with awful future possibilities. Then I quit purely out of the emotional stress inferior Ne anxiety brings. Then it starts over again. I know it‚Äôs illogical. But it feels so heavy while I‚Äôm in it, with immediate relief when I quit. Then a different form of anxiety accrues as I don‚Äôt have an income.

isfj,"I got into mbti over the summer and have been wondering about my type. I think I'm ISFJ because out of all the function stacks (which is what the theory is really about), it's the only one that really makes any sense. The problem is I feel like all the descriptions of the types on the internet are very exaggerated. Ex: thinkers are cold robots and feelers are emotional wrecks. Most people I know don't fall at either of these extremes. Anyway I'm going to go through the function stack and say how I think I use each function. Be warned that this is going to be a long post. I am a 20 year old female and I'm pretty sure my enneagram is 9w1 if that helps.

Dominant Si: My understanding of this function is that it looks to the past to plan for the future. When I first read the descriptions of this my thought was ""ummmm doesn't everyone do this? Like remembering if something similar occured and the way you solved it then would also be effective now, and learning from past mistakes?"" that's usually what I do, but if I encounter a new problem I don't freak out, my Ti can solve it (hopefully). Also I have an AMAZING memory, my family thinks it's photographic. the irony is that while sometimes I'm impressed at my ability to recall something irrelevant from many years ago, I feel like I remember so much less compared to what I take in. I took anatomy last semester, and I feel like I studied so hard that I should remember everything, but I don't. Not to say that I don't remember anything, I just feel that for the amount I studied I should remember more. Also a lot of people describe this function as a ""an organized file system of data/facts/memories."" I don't relate to this so much. I just take in info and it basically just sits there until something similar (or even not so similar) reminds me of that information and I say ""hey that reminds me of xyz..."" also, I'm naturally a pretty disorganized person, and the stereotypical ISFJ is super organized, although I understand that I don't have to fit every description perfectly. As for routine, I have a friend (who I believe is an ISFJ) and she says that she NEEDS a schedule; she needs structure in her day. I don't have this need, but I will admit that I am more productive if I have structure. For Example sometimes I find it easier to do HW on a school day because I have already had structure in the day, as opposed to a weekend it will be a bit harder for me to get started and do things (I hope this makes sense). 

Aux Fe: ok, this one is tricky. I am fairly religious (Jewish), and I think that both Fe and Fi functions are developed because of that. Fe because at a very young age I was trained ""love your fellow like yourself"" and to be nice and to endlessly give (obviously as long as it's not draining you). At the same time I also have deeply held values that I would not violate under most circumstances (I would say all circumstances, but there are exceptions and I don't like to make blanket statements like that). I usually do just go along with whatever everyone else wants, but usually because it's convenient and I honestly couldn't care less. If my friends want to do something that I'm not comfortable with, I am not afraid to stand my ground and not do it, but I'm not gonna make a big fuss either. I have read that Fe users can read other people really well and tend to their needs, but they are not good at understanding their own emotions. Idk if this is true, but I usually am in tune with my own emotions. I usually know what I am feeling. I also respect social norms without too much issue, because at the end of the day if they didn't exist I think life would be kind of confusing. Something else I thought to mention is that I hate to admit it, but deep down I do care what others think of me, but I definitely don't let it dictate my life. When I was younger I was always the nerdy kid and maybe this is where this desire came from. At a certain point (maybe my early teens?) I realized that I just had to be myself, but obviously still while following the social norms. I definitely feel comfortable in my own skin, but there are still certain hobbies or other things that I like that I just keep to myself about because honestly they are kind of weird and I don't want to be a outcast, and it's also to complicated to explain my interests to people. I am probably misunderstanding Fe and/or Fi, so please just lmk if I am.

Tertiary Ti: When I make decisions, the first thing that I do is usually weigh pros and cons, but they are always more personal pros and cons if that makes any sense. Also when I decide to stand for a specific value, I use logic to prove why it is important to me. I think it's all nice and dandy to have a great cause to fight for, but if you don't know why you are doing it you can easily give up when the going gets tough. I also love learning and I was always pretty good at school. Like I mentioned before, I have a great memory, so I was great at subjects that involved pure memorization, like history. As I got older and started to take more conceptual classes, I liked those much better than the memorizing classes. I loved chemistry when I first learned it (told you I was a nerd :) that I wanted to be a chemist lol. I recently took physics for my first time in college, and while it was a bit more of a challenge than chemistry, I found it fascinating. 

Inferior Ne: I have read online that this manifests as thinking about possible negative scenarios, and honestly I did feel a little called out. When i wake up with a sore throat, I think ""oh no. it's strep, pneumonia, bronchitis, what if I can't go to school today?"" and then I tell myself to stop being ridiculous. what's ironic is that I make fun of other people when they do this. So while I can relate to this, I'm not sure how many problems in my life are caused by this. I've seen inferior ne as a fear of the unknown, but I can't say I'm so scared this. I don't have to know everything. What will be will be and there is no point in being scared of what I don't know. Related to this point, I have seen that IxxJ's are the more controlling types. I never really saw myself as a controlling person, but I think that's just because I don't control people, but to a certain extent I do ""micromanage"" my life. Weird example: when I see a bug in my house, particularly near my room, I force myself to muster up the courage to kill it because who knows where the heck I'm gonna see that thing next? In my bed? shoes? I hope not.

When my boyfriend was in elementary school his teacher(s) suspected he could have ADD/ADHD. When they approached his parents with this assumption his parents basically denied the school to investigate further.

My bf is currently 24 &amp; we have been together for 4.5 years. Very recently we have came to the conclusion that he most likely does have (undiagnosed) ADD/ADHD. Once we looked further into it things started to make more sense, such as why we would get into arguments.

An overview of the alpha quadra in socionics (model A)/MBTI. The alpha quadra types are ILE (in MBTI ENTP), SEI (in MBTI ISFJ), ESE (in MBTI ESFJ) and LII (in MBTI INTP).

(- Fe)  = minimization or avoidance of negative emotions, prevention of quarrels, scandals, and other situations causing emotional instability, which is valued as more important than the creation of positive emotional effect.

(- Ti) = global structural logic. Systematic analysis is the instrument that they use in understanding the world. They are primarily interested in the universal laws which govern its workings. To that end, all traditions, conventions and restrictions are discarded. Everything is subjected to analysis, redefinition, and analogies. Their main pursuit is the creation of a comprehensive, breathtaking, and singular picture of the world. The idea of unity, reasonableness and fairness in all things permeates their vision completely.

(+ Si)  = positive feelings of comfort. They cannot effectively realize their potential if their lifestyle is full of hardships. Their style of activity is characterized by relaxation, freedom, and the availability of amenities. Relations with the external environment, where their activities unfold, must be friendly and pleasant. Their groups are always comfortable, relaxed as if at home, and never rough or eccentric.

(+ Ne)  = promising ideas. Frequent talks of the future, the unexplored and unknown possibilities. Incorrigible dreamers. They put forward ""crazy"" theories, and discuss them with pleasure... Some of these theories, however, will lead long lives!

ILE/ENTP  +Ne -Ti

SEI/ISFJ     +Si -Fe

ESE/ESFJ  -Fe +Si

LII/INTP    -Ti +Ne

isfj,"Hi fellow ISFJs and ISFJ enthusiasts! I am an ISFJ who is of an age where I should have had my driver's license a long time ago, yet no matter how much practice I get, I continue to fail the driver's test.  I have failed it twice now, each time a year apart and the first time a year after I should have taken the test in the first place, and now it's been over a year since the last time and I'm terrified to take it again.  When I practice driving, I'll be doing fine, but then I'll make a super beginner mistake.  Something in my mind just does not click when it comes to driving.  My dad is an ENTP and he's an amazing driver.  My mom is an ISTJ and she's humorously stereotypical; she talks about the ""rules of the road"" a lot. She's a very present and focused person, so she drives pretty well, but she has some of the driving anxiety I have.  My question for all you lovely ISFJs is did or do any of you struggle with getting the hang of driving?  For no reason that you can fathom?

isfj,"ISFJ here needing advice from you guys cause maybe you might understand me. So I‚Äôm emotional and I know I can be logical but when someone I‚Äôm close to or something hurts me emotionally I can‚Äôt help but act right away to either end the conflict, fix it or just get out of the situation and sometimes thats me wanting to end relationships before I feel hurt more so like throwing in the towel before it gets worse.
However my fellow intuitive friends read between the lines of a conflict and sometimes seem okay to wait before taking action or think things through before reacting. By reacting I don‚Äôt mean get abusive and shout or Throw things, I mean like crying or ending a relationship right then and there because it hurts too much if there‚Äôs no solution right away or making a rush decision.
Seeing as we are sensors it has been hard for me not to react in the moment.
So my question is, how have you guys done it so that you can cool off and wait it out instead so as to make a well informed decision that isn‚Äôt just relying on your feelings?? Has anyone else also had a hard time not being able to ignore your emotions in the moment?

isfj,"Hi fellas,   


Some of you may have answer me on an old post.   


I'll resume the situation briefly, I (ENTP 26) was seeing an 22 ISFJ that was 5 months away of an 8 year relation.   
Everything was fine but she wasn't ""out"" of the old relation yet and basically she put a ""stop"" in front of my face.   


Flash forward one week after the definitive stop... I contact one of her friend because I had a real work related question to her. Just after that, she messaged me ironically teasing me with a ""Well well flirting with my friends eh ? I always knew it...""   


The whole evening and day after until 17 PM was some weird ""flirting technique without showing it"" 

She wanted me to tell her qualities, I answered with ""ironic flirt"" as well then she said ""I'm going to copy you but you were very warmful as well...."" 

All of the conversation is basically that kind of flirting.

&amp;#x200B;

Then, afterwards, yesterday at 5PM she out of the blue stopped opening snapchat, I didn't send anything more until today 3 PM. Still wasn't opened. 

Yet she took a look at my instagram story and posted one as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have one simple question, does it look like she is missing me but still not sure about what to do or was she simply looking for an ego boost ?",1602005618
isfj,"There are studies that suggest altruism is partly inherited. I think this is true, like the Fe function in MBTI. If disorders like anti-social personality (psychopathy) are inherently biological at one extreme end, then there's probably the opposite of over-selflessness. Unfortunately, I don't know if there's a study on it, but I read that the average person doesn't feel empathy except for people they know and are close to. Altruists feel empathy for strangers, and psychopaths can toggle their empathy and choose not to use it. And of course, there's cognitive empathy which is a skill that needs to be developed as people mature. In the end, people's different traits balance out and serve different roles in society?

Because of him never seemingly having the time to meet, I met other people in between. 
So now we started talking again. Every day.
And we have both declared our interest in another.
But... For the next 4 weeks, he's not going to be able to meet for a date. I have told him that it's on him now, because he rejected me the two times I asked him out.
He told me he's all mine (üòÖ) when he's done, but his reluctancy to meet up just feels like he only wants validation and a ego boost.

He took the test way back March 2020 and told me we can talk about the results (We were already off duty after he took the test). But then, COVID happened and we didn't see each other until this month. We don't really communicate and most of our interaction is work related. If I message him, he reply's right away all the time but it's a quick converasation. We enjoy teasing each other, but our convos are quick too. I do notice a bit by bit improvement in our communication as time go by though. 

I still want to talk to him about the mbti result. As ISFJ's, is it okay if I bring it up again? Im afraid I'd bore him with the MBTI. Will ISFJ's be okay worh talking deeply about MBTI? If not, to what extent?

isfj,"Hello! I'm an INFJ female and met a ISFJ male a couple of weeks ago. He's only ever taken the test once and it was because I asked him to (mentioning in case that means there's potential to be mistyped).

Since we met, I've seen him 4 times and we talk pretty much every day, not like super long conversations but enough to know what's going on with each other and joking around a little bit + some flirting. 

I haven't dated in a looooong time but I did hang out with someone else several times before I met the ISFJ, and I didn't really feel like I liked that person, so I know I'm not just falling for the first person I meet. With the ISFJ guy I enjoyed myself a lot the first time we met, and the subsequent times just made me like him more and more. He talks about how he likes to help his friends with stuff and how seeing one of his friends who had an accident makes him feel sad sometimes and my heart is just like aWwWwW what a sweetie &lt;333. I like that he is genuinely sweet and good, but can also take me making fun of him and makes fun of me back. Everything about him as a person just melts my cold, dead heart. I told him he's like the unicorn stuffed toy that the little girl squeezes in Despicable Me, tooo cute. He said he doesn't know if it's a good thing haha. But I mean... I still think of him as a guy. I still want him to kiss me, he just hasn't yet :)

I just moved to a city that he grew up in, so he also gets excited about bringing me around and showing me stuff. But sometimes when I see stuff I'm like ""oh cool that's nice"" and he's kinda like ""GEEZE why are you so underwhelmed"" - that's just how I respond haha I'm not an enthusiastic puppy like he is. I think he's starting to get that that's just how I am and I'm not *not* having a good time, so that's fine.

So far I think he likes me, but I also want to know more about what I can do to make him like me *more*. I always thank him after we go out, because I'm polite but also because I always genuinely enjoy the time I spent with him. I worry if there are things about me that would raise red flags for him? I've never had a long-term relationship, just a couple of 6-12 month ones. I could be wrong, but I don't think of myself as commitment phobic, I just think of it as not finding the right people. I'm not doing well career-wise (I'm oookay but not great), and I just moved to a new country where the cost of living is way more than the one I moved from, so I'm miles away from considering buying a house in the future, but he is looking to buy one. I don't want him to think I'm looking for someone to live off or anything because I can take care of myself, I'd just have a more simple life. Being INFJ I cling on to my fantasy of making it as a writer and it keeps me going too.

What worries me about him is that he just ended a 7+ year relationship a few months ago, and I'm scared to be the person who comes after that. He also said I'm the first person he's met. If I was his friend and he started dating the first girl he met right after a long relationship I'd be like uhh you need to meet more people. Also he's lived here for a long time and I kinda feel like everything is already set up for him and he has his whole life here and maybe there isn't that much room for me? I don't know. I  also wonder if he just starts dating someone and stays in the relationship even if he's unhappy? 7 years is a long time, and I wouldn't want him to date me for that long before we broke up, we're in our early 30s and I don't want to date someone who's never going to get married.

isfj,"Does anyone have a disdain for the ambiguity surrounding the schedule for full-time salaried work? Meaning, hourly workers typically know their schedule. There are clear boundaries (ie you clock-in at 9, clock-out at 5). Salaried workers on the other hand are supposed to be available at times before and after normal business hours - whatever it takes to get the job done. That may entail having a meeting pop up with an important client last minute just when you thought you were done for the day.

Personally I have a huge problem with this ambiguity in my schedule. I like boundaries and clear lines. I like to compartmentalizations. I like knowing when and where I‚Äôm expected to be, without any surprises. 

Though salaried positions often pay more and offer benefits that some hourly and contract workers may not receive... I‚Äôm not sure that‚Äôs worth it to me. Because my personal time is more important. 

All of this makes sense considering we have Te polr, Ni demon, Se ignoring, and Ne inferior. All relating to learning/working for the sake of achieving (Te), brute force which ignores the status quo and physical internal comfort/homeostasis (Se), ambiguity around future knowns and possibilities (Ni/Ne).

TLDR: major vibes with isfj guy but he is quite careful what he says around me and doesn‚Äôt talk about his true feelings or opinions of people often, why? How do I change this because I just want him to be comfortable and himself. Even if we just stay friends.

Hi, Enfj girl who likes an isfj guy here.
We are friends yet have major chemistry and we always have. When we met and were getting to know each other, he would always be messaging me, offering to help me with things, being shy and smiley and staring at me and remembered everything about me. Feelings were strong which was undeniable but (long story short) I distanced myself from him because I wasn‚Äôt in a good place at the time, but did this kind of suddenly without a proper explanation (I regret this) and we grew apart. He was seeing someone else for a bit (though nothing became of that in the end. He admitted to our mutual friend that he just wanted the validation.) It was always unspoken that there was something between us though, until I got drunk and sent him a big message ages ago telling him I used to have feelings but he just denied that anything ever happened to save face. 

It‚Äôs been a year now and we talk a lot more again and I‚Äôve sorted myself out. I still like him. Though he hasn‚Äôt said anything, I get the feeling he might feel the same way again because the vibe is like how it was back then all over again. But when I try to make the conversation deep, he doesn‚Äôt want to talk about his feelings or his true opinions and keeps things kind of formal. As someone who is an open book I struggle to understand it :(

 I'm still extremely unsure about my MBTI type, but I noticed a pattern in myself that I feel might illuminate it. Even after somebody hurts me gravely, I treasure them as a person. I might convince myself that I despise them or that it is not worth caring about them, but deep down something inside of me is weeping for what we could have been.

One of my best friends from elementary school severed our friendship as a child, when she found a more outgoing, dazzling friend. As a child it hurt me so much, but now I feel so proud of her. She has done extraordinarily well, gotten into an amazing school. As children she was always fascinated by science. Now she is an a top university pursuing it. Even though she is a very flawed and imperfect person, she is still special to me.

When I see pictures of her it hurts still because I see glimmers of the friend I used to know. And I feel proud of her for transcending in such a way. I harbor no resentment for, even though she hurt me. Because I know her. I know her heart, even when she was lost and cruel to me as a child. I myself have done terrible things that opened my eyes to how lost I was. But in the end I could never remain resentful of her. She has a beautiful mind and I believe I good heart. And I wish her the best always. It's so sublime seeing how far she has come and how we have evolved, while bittersweet at the same time. I only hope she will continue to grow as a person. Seeing her blossom makes me feel overwhelmingly, achingly joyful. Part of me perhaps does feel remorseful, but I know she is good at heart and so I truly feel happy for her.

This ISFJ is very hard on herself. It's something I always discouraged. If she makes a mistake, she says she's so stupid. I remind her she's just human and mistakes happen. If something doesn't look good on her but looks good on the model, she says she's so ugly. I remind her that she's my cute little girlfriend (she's short hence the little) and I don't date ugly people. 

During the process of de-girlfriending, she seems to say things implying everything will be better for me with the ""next girl"". Perhaps I am trying to read too much into this, but I am wondering if she's putting herself down again, implying she's trash or not good enough. Or if she's ""throwing it in my face"" that I will eventually be with someone else.

I've always wanted the best for my ISFJ. I did everything I could think of to make her happy. I guess it just wasn't the correct things. I have long suspected my ISFJ is broken. After 3 years, I have hardly seen her happy, although she claimed to have happy periods. It bothers me if she's putting herself down again. Not sure what to say to her.

We very much appreciate the feedback that some of you have shared and we are working hard on some big changes.

We wanted to flag our new podcast called Personality Love Lab. We noticed that there are a lot of resources about the theory behind Myers-Briggs but not many examples of how it plays out in real life. Personality Love Lab is a series of interviews with real couples of different personality types.

In the most recent episode, we interviewed Andy McNab (ex-special forces hero, functioning psychopath and best-selling author) and his wife, Lily. He‚Äôs an ISTP and she‚Äôs an ESFJ. The episode before is about a couple who met on So Syncd. We have interviewed more ISFJs than any other personality type! Episodes two, four, six and eight are interviews where one half is an ISFJ and we recorded an episode with an ISFJ-ESFJ couple last night. 

We are just starting to record the second season and we are looking for couples who are interested in being interviewed. It‚Äôs just audio and we can change your names if you‚Äôd prefer. The couples we‚Äôve interviewed so far have loved it. We even had someone cry because he was so touched by what his partner (an ISFJ) was saying about him (an ISTP of all the personality types!).

I've known this ISFJ for a very long time, since we were little kids, though we never really talked much, but lately we've been talking a lot after coincidentally getting a job at the same place. I've never really managed to get along very deeply with other ISFJs I've met except for my grandma, but her and I seemed to hit it off once we started talking again. She's come to trust me enough to tell me about her life and what she actually thinks and is going through, which is something that literally no one else except one person in her past has gotten the honor of. She doesn't seem to know a lot about my life or feelings because she doesn't tend to ask. She considers me someone she can trust though at least.

Well, yesterday we had a talk about how she tends to put other people's feelings as a higher priority than mine, even though these people are people she doesn't even like, but she'll still pamper them at the cost of me. She tells me this is because she sees them as immature so if she doesn't give them what they want, they'll feel bad and then she'll feel bad, but she apologizes for not making me a priority over them. Next day at work, she's obviously tired and I ask if she has been able to get enough sleep, I know she's not able to get enough sleep because her life sucks and her parents are immature and narcissistic ticks, but I just wanted to know if she was willing to tell me what was actually going on. She gets annoyed and says that she's not going to tell me because I'll just ask more questions if she did, which totally threw me off guard, because that isn't necessarily true. Then after I got off I found her and tried to talk about that, asking what's wrong with asking questions. She just mumbles under her breath to just stop asking questions. I follow her around a little more to see if she will say something else, but then just tells me that she's doing her job and rolls her eyes at me. This is totally out of character. None of these things she seems to be getting annoyed with me have ever been a problem. It's an easy going job, I can see she's not pressed for time, I've followed her around many many times before and we've just talked then, she's never gotten annoyed with me asking questions before, though she has simply not wanted to talk about certain things before, absolutely everything she's doing is completely out of the norm and I can't figure out what she's mad at me for. Sure, she's tired, probably stressed because her job treats her like a minimum wage manager, but she's never taken any of those things out on me, she just tells me about it but she never gets frustrated at me for it.

Do any of you have any idea what's going on? I mean I suppose I could have done something I didn't know about, but I didn't talk to her the entire day beforehand. She'll sometimes get a little offended if I don't say certain things or ""compare"" her to someone she doesn't like or something, but I did literally nothing and she's never acted like this before.",1601591376

Dimensionality of functions is the number of parameters with the reference to which the function is processing information. Each function can be well developed, to the point of effective use, with different methods and efforts.

1D (Ex) = experience.

2D (Nr) = experience + norms.

3D (St) = experience + norms + situation.

4D (Tm) = experience + norms + situation + time.

Overall the hardest to develop are 1D functions, as they require specifically experience / trial and error /detailed step by step guides.

For example on paper the standard order of strength of functions in an ILI-0/INTJ is at it follows:  4D valued Leading/Dominant Ni, 4D unvalued Demonstrative/Critics Ti (it's about as strong as Ni, but unvalued), 3D valued Creative/Parent Te, 3D unvalued Observing/Nemesis Ne, 2D valued Mobilizing/Child Fi, 2D unvalued Role/Demon Si, 1D valued Suggestive/Inferior Se, 1D unvalued Vulnerable/Trickster Fe.

  The enneagram (basic motivations), as well as non-typology factors, can influence the individual in how he/she chooses to develop functions.  These differentations can lead to ""pseudo-types"", with the individual appearing to have a different type on surface level. A lot of people mistype themselves initially to the pseudo type. Also a celeb can be easily mistyped superficially to his/her pseudo-type.

  Pseudo-types can lead to pseudo inter type relations (involving both individuals' pseudo-types or between a pseudotype of onewith the real stype of the other). At the end of the day it's the real sociotype that matters the most in the evaluation of inter type relations as in a lot of occasion the two individuals seek to get closer emotionally and psychologically.

 Socionics tackled the issue of pseudo-types by proposing different subtypes. Overall they're unnecessary as you can use the enneagram system is much better in highlighting basic motivations and non-typology factor can also influence the development of cogfxs. 

Just for your info I'll give you a list of all socionics subtypes:

\--------

First subtype: (I)Stype-Xi; (E)Stype-Xe. 

(Example: ILI-Ni; ILE-Ne)

Strongest function: 4Dv Leading/Dominant

Weakest function:  1Dv Suggestive/Inferior

Extra notes: 2Dv Mobilizing/Child boosted for its type.

&amp;#x200B;

No subtype: Stype-0

(Example: ILI-0, ILE-0)

Strongest functions: 4Dv Leading/Dominant + 4Du Demonstrative/Critics

Weakest functions: 1Du Vulnerable/Trickster + 1Dv Suggestive/Inferior

Extra notes: Very flexible for its type.

&amp;#x200B;

Second subtype:

(Example: ILI-Te, ILE-Ti)

Strongest functions: 4Du Demonstrative/Critics

Weakest functions: 1Du Vulnerable/Trickster 

Extra notes: Secret strenght in 4Du Demonstrative/Critics; 2Du Role/Demon boosted for its type.

&amp;#x200B;

DHCN subtypes:

Dominant: Use of Te and Fe outside basic roles for its type (strong correlation with E 3, 7, 8, SX).

Creative: Use of Ne and Se outside basic roles for its type (strong correlation with E 4, 5, 7, SX).

Normalizing: Use of Ti and Fi outside basic roles for its type (strong correlation with E 1, 5, 6, SO).

Harmonizing: Use of Ni and Si outside basic roles for its type (strong correlation with E 2, 4, 9, SP).

I (an INFJ) started seeing an ISFJ almost 2 months ago. I definitely like how things are headed, but one thing that I‚Äôve been stuck on is communication. 

I‚Äôm someone who likes to have open and candid communication. What‚Äôs your history/your past? What‚Äôs your love language? What pisses you off? What is your deepest insecurity? What are your dreams? How do you like your eggs? 

I tend to be fearful of asking these sorts of questions because I don‚Äôt want to come off too strong. Usually, I prefer when someone starts asking me those types of questions first so that I can reciprocate. That being said, I noticed this guy doesn‚Äôt ask questions about me like that, so I tried initiating those questions first. He‚Äôll answer, but he doesn‚Äôt seem interested in asking those questions back.

It made me concerned that he wasn‚Äôt that interested in me, but his actions have shown otherwise (he‚Äôs very physically-giving).

This weird communication thing makes it so that neither of us have really brought up ‚Äúus‚Äù. It‚Äôs implied that we‚Äôre exclusive but we haven‚Äôt had an explicit conversation about it. And I want to ask things like ‚Äúwhat makes you feel loved?‚Äù but I don‚Äôt want to ask that if I don‚Äôt even *explicitly* know if this is a budding relationship or something casual.

isfj,"Hi everyone ENTP here  


Some of you may remember the story I posted last week here and I'm about to write its latest conclusion. 

To summarize it, an high school crush and I found ourselves back in mid-july. She went out of an 8 year relation in april-may.   


We instantly connected and there was an incredible chemistry between us. She already talked about me to her mum, introduced her friends, .... . Basically everything felt smooth, she said she believed and knew what I could bring to ever etc. I understood her quite easily and I felt like I found another part of me (which isn't very common being ENTP).   


The only ""bad point"" was that it was too early for her. Now a week ago she asked me for ""time"" to try and go over it. yesterday I figured out that she couldn't and that she wouldn't do the first step and tell it to me so I created an opportunity for her. She said that she "" didn't feel like going on with me or anyone else, that she wanted to stay alone"".   


I instantly told her that it was understandable, that I stood by everything I said to her and that maybe we'd cross path again. She answered that she was happy that she met me once again because I helped her understanding herself and she added ""Maybe see you in the future""   


Ngl to you pals, it hit me pretty hard. It's one of those few times where I felt a real connection and I'm deeply saddened by it. I of course know that I have to keep going in my life and not wait for her.   


But in order to appease my ""Ne"" that always see possibilities, would this ""bad timing"" prevent her from wanting anything with me ever again ? I had that ESFJ ex that was all about ""one fucking chance if it goes from no matter the reason it's destiny"" and I wanted to know if that was the case for you in general as well ?   


We did not argue nor anything, I believe she was just afraid of starting something real with someone whom she had a strong connection with knowing it could fail. Therefore she put a stop on it before possibly hurting me (and her).",1601286140

When you get in the classroom, everyone has maks on and everyone is 2 meters apart and we can't really talk to each other because of the distance. Classes are fluid. For example, there is not the same person in two classes. Furthermore, the school district has made the year into 4 parts instead of two which my school calls quadmester. Every quadmester has two courses in it and as stated above, two people will probably never be in the same class. And this really made my situation worse because I'm the new guy that nobody knows and  this is the first time that the introvert aspect of me didn't get in the way of me making friends. I thought that I could really make friends but no such luck. This had made me really sad and upset, but it has got to a point that I can't even feel the sadness. I tried to do stuff that would help me clear my head, but to no avail. Yes it may distract me for 4 to 5 hours but after that, nothing. I start thinking about my situation and it just gets worse and there is no place to off-load this sadness. As a matter of fact, i hate off-loading my problems to other people; i don't want my burden to upset other people. I really don't know what to do.

I've been doing some mild research (like, obsessive reading and Youtube video watching) since my crush is an ISFJ and I am probably the only ENTP in the world that got friendzoned by an ISFJ ( how does it work so magically for others?).

So I noticed you guys don't like directly saying no. For example, instead of saying ""I am sorry I can't make it,"" you let it hang and give hope that you might actually make it. What is the best way to get you to be honest in what you want/need before it's too late, because I, as an ENTP, really appreciate when people tell me directly what makes them happy and what doesn't. This gives me an idea about how/when I can make you happy or leave you alone. Or do you actually prefer being vague and not having to answer an invitation or making a choice? Or do you not know what you actually want/need most of the time?

The ISFJ in question avoids meeting me because he has already friendzoned me but keeps being one of the first people to view my stories, shares his day when we text, sends selfies, photos of what he is doing, a lot of shirtless gym selfies (compliment fishing?), etc. And I never ask him to send me those! He is going through some difficult stuff now, so I get it and no longer have expectations from him, friends it is! But his behavior sometimes confuses me.

Do you think this is an ISFJ thing, in general? How would you like to be treated, do you still want to be invited to places, offered things? Do you want us to stop inviting you after one ""No"" or avoidance? I wanna repeat that I don't want anything from him now, just trying to be a friend, like he asked me to, but I just don't know how to be a friend to him.

This is actually the first time in my life that I am curious about ISFJs, so forgive me if I don't know much about you guys YET.",1601076703

isfj,"Hi guys I just noticed something about myself and the attention I get and how oblivious I can be to it all.

I usually don‚Äôt mind being behind the scenes and not into the spotlight and so because of this I sometimes would be quiet in situations, around people or at work in the hopes that no one will notice me or pay attention to me. There are times when I‚Äôll go about doing my own thing minding my business and hoping no one is really paying attention to me, but unfortunately they DO. 
Ive had people complain that I didn‚Äôt give them enough attention and so got mad at me and thought I was arrogant or assumed I‚Äôm not approachable enough. This has occurred so many times but I don‚Äôt understand it because most of these people could be like strangers or roommates and
I‚Äôm not super close to them to really try harder than a cordial greeting and respectfully minding my business.
It‚Äôs like I usually hope I‚Äôm invisible to people, or I don‚Äôt matter enough to seem interesting enough for people to want me to make efforts to give my time and attention to them or for them to take so much time analyzing me and why I‚Äôm doing my own thing.
And I don‚Äôt mean it in an insecure way but I realize it‚Äôs like I have admirers around me that I didn‚Äôt ask to have nor expect or even want to have.
As a result I‚Äôve had people have a crush on me, or admire me so much and yet we haven‚Äôt spoken which makes me feel even more self conscious because I didn‚Äôt realize people are even noticing my existence or let alone analyzing me.

I have adhd and had selective mutism as a child with a controlling/narcissistic mom- so even though I‚Äôm the isfj type my mom taught me to be different. I remember giving her a nail polish when I was 6th &amp; she looked at me and happily said ‚Äúaww I‚Äôm returning it‚Äù. She made me fear showing vulnerability/affection and reaching out &amp; giving. 

The adhd-PI makes me way more distracted and hard to get things done from years of habits although I recently got adderall. My mom has made it hard for me to make choices and do things myself. The selective mutism is just slight shyness now so I can be nervous and almost seem different- If I think someone‚Äôs mad at me I kinda avoid them because I don‚Äôt want to make them uncomfortable by making them talk to me if they‚Äôre upset. I‚Äôm pretty easy going and not picky about things so I‚Äôm not controlling- but at the same time I am- I get scared when people I‚Äôm closest to seem like they‚Äôre gonna leave me &amp; I might be picky  and just not realize. 

I‚Äôve had a lot of people question me to help me figure out my exact type and they all say isfj &amp; so do the tests and I fit with isfj online- I‚Äôm just shyer, more distracted, and afraid to be giving/ vulnerable although I like giving to others a lot!",1600862487
isfj,"Ive started to realize this about myself mostly because I‚Äôm surrounded by intuitives but even when I think back Ive realized that when I‚Äôm in a situation I just mostly take it very literally and mostly at face value about a person, I‚Äôll then have an intuitive in my life say something about said person or Situation but predict something they might say/do, or who they are as a person and I‚Äôm confused as to how they got to such a conclusion.
With me it‚Äôs like I need proof sometimes or I‚Äôll record an encounter with them as isolated incidences and it‚Äôs only after they repeat something a few times that I‚Äôd conclude something but even then it will be me just concluding on that ONE thing not the general idea of who they are. Once I have a general idea of who they are, it‚Äôs after months or years of knowing the person not by little things they do or say here and there. 

Because of this Im oblivious when someone‚Äôs flirting or interested and usually find out VERY late that a person likes me romantically when everyone else around me seems to be SURE while I deny it cause no way. 
A good example of this is that my INTJ person whom I‚Äôve known for YEARS always used to ask me questions about what I like, my sexual preferences, my values, my beliefs, if i wanted to get married etc... and I answered but NEVER thought much about it over those years. It‚Äôs only later when we told each other how we felt that It connected that he was in fact into me for YEARS maybe even analyzing me but I just assumed we where just talking/getting to know each other but nothing more or less.

So I wonder if I made him feel unsafe. üòî Any way we are texting again but it seems to stop and start abruptly unlike before.

isfj,"Hello, so like many individuals out there, I took the 16personalities test years ago, and I got isfj. from then on i was pretty certain that i was an isfj. that is until about 2 years ago. i‚Äôd been learning more and more about mbti, and after a while i had what i would call a mini personality crisis. basically  i was unsure if i genuinely was an isfj, or whether i was just boxing myself in to fit the descriptions of the type. during that period i tended to get infp whenever i took personality tests ( 16personalities, personality junkie, truity, and maybe some others). 

however, more recently my results have mostly switched back to isfj,  but i still get infp now and then.

anyways, i‚Äôm curious if there‚Äôs a clear way to distinguish if someone is an infp or isfj.  in terms of cognitive functions they‚Äôre rather similar, but i was wondering if there‚Äôs a distinct way to tell them apart in terms of mannerisms/real-life behaviour. also i‚Äôm not sure if this affects anything but i‚Äôm an enneagram type 9, so could that be why i tend to vacillate between isfj and infp?

i‚Äôm hoping this can help fellow uncertain hoomans out there too :^)",1600795892

isfj,"hey there! not sure if it‚Äôs a weird question to ask in the first place but is it normal to feel this way? a case in point would be how my friends would ask me to hang out with them (around a group of 5 including me, going out for lunch/ dinner ‚Äî esp because of covid i‚Äôm a lot more hesitant bcos i‚Äôm scared of leaving the house...), and i actually feel excited 2-3 days prior to the actual hangout date itself. but when the hangout date actually comes... i somehow dread it?? all of a sudden i wouldn‚Äôt want to leave my house and i don‚Äôt wish to meet them anymore... 

i don‚Äôt even know what type of feeling it is?? i‚Äôm a relatively sociable person as far as it goes ‚Äî in new situation/circumstances i don‚Äôt mind talking to people and stuff but i somehow just don‚Äôt enjoy hanging out that much with a large setting of people (even 5 seems too much sometimes...) is this just a me issue?? 

i was also curious if this is specifically an isfj issue? on different websites i tried different tests but i got my results to be a good mix of isfj and infj and i‚Äôm not sure which personality type do i fit in...

isfj,"Hi all, I am here to make more sense of my situation, and in hopes that people here will help me on my way of finding answers to my questions.

I met an ISFJ man a few months ago, I really liked him and almost fell for him (thankfully, could stop myself falling in love, but I still deeply like and care for him). He recently pulled away after my jealousy incident. And then became cold and distant, and then when I asked him if he still wants to date, he said he doesn't want to date now but doesn't want to lose me as a friend (Ouch!).

He is going through some personal stuff, overthinking a lot and is generally depressed. He has a lot of fears and is insecure about his own worth for relationships because he thinks that things may happen in his future that he can't control (he has a legit reason for it). Has a few layers of walls up, does the push and pull a lot. At first, he slowly let me in through the outer layer, was sharing, texting, meeting up, video calls before bed, and then kicked me out completely. To be completely objective, I have the impression that he did not like me that much from the beginning because I was too eager and too open and showing my emotions as they were. He has never really committed to anyone for the long term, has difficulty letting ppl in but is very attractive and gets women's attention.

So after he said he just wants to be normal friends, I told him that I need more and can't just be friends, I need to move on. He was like we will still talk and ask about each other. I told him sure, but I need my space right now.

The funny thing is, we have not talked since (been about 4 days) but he watches my stories, likes my photos. He just keeps reminding me about himself. He generally romanticizes his past experiences with women, I think he is dating all of them in his mind because it's safe there and feels good lol.

So, can any of you relate? Is there anything I need to know about your crowd that helps me understand why I got friendzoned (because at some point, things were going so good). As an ENTP, I take his words as they are, the guy doesn't like me much, wants the benefits of my company by staying friends but doesn't want to commit himself to a relationship.

Now I do everything that was already suggested (being patient kind understanding her etc.
Which is not really into my nature of entp, understanding feelings but I do my best and it comes quite naturally this time 

The thing is when we‚Äôre together she seems very happy, she says so herself and already says that she trust me and knows what I could bring to her (in a positive way)

But after that when she‚Äôs alone she goes into full ‚Äúhesitation mode‚Äù thinking it‚Äôs too early for her etc etc.

I think she‚Äôs overthinking ( I know that feeling being entp) and that‚Äôs it‚Äôs a spiral where she‚Äôll feel more and more ‚Äúblocked‚Äù as long as she more and more thinks about it.

isfj,"I‚Äôm an INFJ and my wife of ten years is an ISFJ. We‚Äôve always been Christian, and originally met at church. She‚Äôs very conservative and takes her beliefs very seriously, and I think it‚Äôs safe to say that they are a real safety for her. I know they were for me! We have two kids and usually get on well.

Well, about a year ago I finished a long, drawn out realization that I don‚Äôt believe anymore. I went from a serious evangelical to I guess a pantheist or agnostic or something. I‚Äôm not anti-Christian or anything. I just no longer believe following a long process of gravity dragging me  down the slippery slope. 

At first I thought maybe I don‚Äôt need to tell her. I can pretend. I‚Äôm good at pretending when I need to. But I think I do have to let her know. So, I tested the waters with political stuff. She‚Äôs very conservative politically, as I once was. I started to share some political disagreements I have and some of my moderate or liberal leanings. These have not been well received, as it seems to me that she feels threatened by her worldview not being shared or validated by me. That‚Äôs my read on it, anyway. I think she feels like I‚Äôm attacking her when I disagree, though that is not my intent. 

So this leaves me feeling, frankly, afraid to share my religious reconversion with her. I‚Äôm terrified that I will upset her and that it will strain our relationship. That sort of relational tension, as an INFJ I guess, is unbearable. Secondary to this, I worry if I will still be loved and accepted once I remove my mask, so to speak. Raising our 2 and 1 year old boys so far has left us precious little time together and we bicker more than usual, often, to my dismay, about political stuff. 

So I don‚Äôt know what to do. Do I tell her, or keep it a secret? I hope to let her know that I respect her beliefs and their importance to her, even if I don‚Äôt share them anymore. I know to her it‚Äôll probably feel like I joined ISIS or something.

A lot of the time, ENTP will try and lead the conversation or ask the whole group a question to get a discussion going.

However, due to some insecurities of me, as well as some past friends of hers I can get a little anxious/protective about who she is with. It‚Äôs an issue that I‚Äôll discuss with my therapist in a couple of weeks. 

Well last night, while drinking I admitted to not helping her out with something earlier this year partly because I looked up an address she had given me and discovered that one of her old bad news friends was associated with it. I meant to tell her this as admission of guilt to how I felt at the time, but it came out as more of an accusation. I wanted to get it off my chest because it‚Äôs best to be honest with friends. I know those feelings were irrational and were never meant to come from a bad place but I know I was in the wrong. 

I immediately apologizing as soon as I said what I said because I knew it came out wrong. 

She said she wasn‚Äôt mad. But she was visibly hurt. She told me that she would choose me over family and that after everything I‚Äôve done for her she‚Äôll never lie to me. I feel like sh*t. Shortly after we hugged and she left, but couldn‚Äôt hold it together long enough without me noticing her crying as she walked out. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôll give her space because that‚Äôs how our friendship is. But I‚Äôm afraid I ruined something so good. My inability to think someone so special could treat me well got the best of me and I know I‚Äôm wrong for that. 

However, we are told to be honest with loved ones and I figured it was good time to get out ahead of it. With the equity each of us have for each other I‚Äôm hoping for us to still be cool. But maybe not?

Krillin has been keeping up with them and the fellow Z fighters for years in the series. He managed to beat the Saibamen on his own and avenge Yamcha's death from them that Nappa and Vegeta brought with them. He remembers details to absurb and large degree with his Si dom. And he worries a lot what will happen and fears negative possibilities with his Ne inferior function. He cares a lot about Si security and hates risk taking, almost to the point of cowardice yes but again I said before, despite this Si security and scared risk and cowardice in him and his character Krillin always stands up to do what's right and jumps in to save the day, or try and help people when he can. He stood up and fought Frieza himself and blasted him several times, he worked together with Gohan and Vegeta to fight Frieza, he teamed up with Gohan the whole Namek arc to fight like the Ginyu force and Captain Ginyu himself. He also stood up to the Cell Jrs and even tried to help Cell himself even when his Si said don't do it any take the risk, he went in anyway and tried to help once Piccolo went to jump in. He even states Goku's idealism for trying to save the day against all odds is rubbing off on him, which is very ironic actually because Goku is an idealistic ENFP and his Ne always sees a possibility to win and stand up and try to do something to beat opponent against impossible odds because Goku always sees the possibility to beat a strong opponent with his Ne and Fi too, this directly correlates with Krillin's Si security himself, which is the opposite function to Ne. So Krillin is admitting basically to using a function he isn't even used to or likes to use in this scene with his inferior Ne. Anyways Krillin's the best and don't let anyone tell you other wise, he's an extroverted introvert which makes sense because ISFJs and INFJs are the most extroverted introverts because of Fe which is no different from Krillin and his extroverted moments as a introvert for Krillin himself. But don't be fooled, he's not ESFJ at all, Krillin is ISFJ definitely. Krillin always remembers details from the past all the time with his Si dom behavior, he remembered what Vegeta said earlier along with Nappa and what they said about the Dragon Ball's earlier and what they said about Piccolo and being able to find out a new planet to find them on, the thought about this past detail to a large degree with his Si and then came up with the Ne idea after thinking about it a lot of maybe Piccolo can be brought back and everyone saved after all if try to go to this planet where these Namekian people live, they might have Dragon Ball's themselves to bring our friends back, which turns out being completely true. 

Krillin remembered with his Si the Kami were once one and the same and then careful observed and remembered what direction Piccolo flew in and told Tien he's going in the direction of the lookout to fuse with Kami permanently, massive Si observation and memory from Krillin here again. Overall though despite his few ideas he comes up with his Ne inferior here and there, Krillin hates Ne overall and again fears negative possibilities from happening in the future to an absurd degree and wants to play things safe with his Si and what's worked before in the past as a Si dom himself. Krillin is underappreciated for his efforts sadly which is a ISFJ stereotype but we love him and his character and bravery despite his fear and he will always be one of the greatest sidekick characters and most loyal and helpful friends to Goku and the other Z fighters ever in all of time. Here's a good character analysis on Krillin down below and Krillin put as a ISFJ on the Dragon Ball Z Chart, as usual I always say and tell people in my opinion this chart is very accurate for an anime MBTI Chart. It's one of the best anime MBTI charts ever and is very, very accurate and correct with the characters typings on here in my opinion, the only thing I disagree with and two characters I always say are wrong in my opinion are Videl and Android 16. In my opinion Videl is definitely ENTJ and Android 16 is definitely ISFJ. But all the other character types are right and spot on for sure on the Dragon Ball Z MBTI chart down below in my opinion and many other people's opinions as well. Check it out here if your interested in checking the DBZ MBTI chart out for yourself and the video for Krillin's character analysis by Nick M will also be posted here down below:

isfj,"Hi, just another person here who can‚Äôt figure out her type. 

I posted once here thinking I was an ISFJ, but as I‚Äôve been reading further about the traits of ISFJ types, I sort of felt out of place and began to wonder if I could be something else...

Reasons why I believe I‚Äôm mistyped:

- I‚Äôve heard that ISFJs are the most extroverted out of all the introverts, since they enjoy getting to know people and are good at engaging in small talks. I don‚Äôt like doing either and both seem a bit pointless to me.

- I seriously hate doing house chores and do not think that they are top priority. Rarely do I ever make my bed, clean my desk, do the dishes on time, etc. 

- I enjoy having theoretical discussions. My sister and I could talk about space, aliens, religion, philosophy, and psychology and not get bored for hours. 

- I don‚Äôt like planning for anything, whether that be trips or what I am going to do the next day (although I seem to have a daily routine everyday...)

- I am not seen as practical by people I am close with. I‚Äôve been told that I can be unconventional at times. 

- I act on impulse a lot. 


I‚Äôve taken multiple tests in the past and have gotten different results (ISFJ, INFP, INFJ) but I decided I was an ISFJ because I have a strong tendency to become a ‚Äòselfless‚Äô person around other people and kind of saw this as my prominent trait. I also value loyalty and feel like it‚Äôs my duty to provide emotional support to people (not sure if I enjoy doing this, however). 
But, I‚Äôve been reading a lot of things about ISFJs that were very unlike me and couldn‚Äôt help thinking that I could be an INFJ. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm an INFP, as I know I tend to be judge-y person.

Also, my enneagram is 4w5, which I believe is rare for ISFJ types.

I tried learning the cognitive functions and their differences but I had no clue which function I normally preferred to use. I just don‚Äôt think I know myself well enough to type myself.",1599877035
isfj,"Hello guys, I had an ISFJ friend, we were kinda close friends and out of sudden she disappeared, she stopped texting, "" we were chatting almost every day"" ,I thought maybe she don't wanna talk or something, but it took too long, so I asked her if something is wrong with her or if I did something bad or anything, she said  no I didn't do anything wrong but she is dealing with things, and then nothing ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è she is still completely not there, even not reacting on a single meme I share üòÇ, now I'm checking on her from time to time ""long periods between every time"" and she is replying kinda normally like there's nothing wrong but replying late sometimes 
Anyway it's probably not only me, probably she is only in contact with 2 of her very close friends, but she is quiet with the rest like that, she is also quiet on her fb not sharing anything, quiet on Whatsapp not posting status, what is wrong with her ?! Should I stop talking from time to time? She just hated me for no reason but she don't wanna end it in a bad way ? But she is doing that with others so I'm really confused, it has been months and I really don't know wtf is this and I'm overthinking about this too much,

isfj,"Hi everyone, I have been pondering my MBTI type furiously for the past few years but to no avail. I believed myself to be an INFP at heart because I feel it captured the essence of my core and how I see the world. I see the world as a glorious and divine tapestry of humankind, glittering wonders, longings, desires, truths, a beautiful landscape of darkness and light, and I am a seeker at my being. That said, I feel like who I have become is so different than the way I came into the earth. When I dissect into my cognitive functions, I realize that, while I do feel very intimately connected with my emotions and listen to the colors of my heart, I might not be Fi-Ne and it could be my type 4 bleeding through instead, obscuring me from seeing my true self.

While I at first struggled to see myself as a Si dominant because I loathe routines and struggle with maintaining them. I have always been a chaotic soul and struggled with following the rules immaculately, but now I have noticed many aspects of myself that align with it. I have always treasured the past deeply, and past sensory experiences are beautiful gifts that I idealize inside. I love the glittering twinkle of snow in winter and the feeling of water draping around me like autumn and the way that rain pours violently, beckoning the earth to tears. I do idealize these feelings and sensory impressions because they resound in me in such profound ways. And I find the world of the known beautifully comforting. It makes me feel relieved and safe and welcomed, and I cherish the things that I know I love. I don't believe I use Se because I abhor violent physical sensations and living recklessly. I despise the way it feels to live in the moment completely unadulterated; it makes me feel uneasy. I treasure the warm cocoon of familiarity. And I do find certain conventional things beautiful. I find the past so enthralling because there is something so beautiful about the innocence of the past and its mysteries. I at first never thought of myself as a sensor because I struggle with a vast ocean of details, and I have always felt gravitated towards understanding the unknown and the unseen-I find it hypnotizingly beautiful. I have never felt afraid of the future and treasure it deeply, because it offers a new glimmer of hope, and it makes me feel alive with wonder. But in the end, I realize that senses are special to me, and truthfully, I don't have a very particularly vivid fantasy world in my mind, even though I delight in my imagination and its little stories. Especially these days, I mainly reminisce and how it could have unraveled differently, to an almost poisonous extent (and I am only eighteen years old, so perhaps this is too early for a tertiary function to manifest). 

I also realize that, as a child, I wanted to give my heart to others. In preschool, when another child was hurt, I would befriend them because I became swallowed by empathy. My heart constantly dazzles with love and the desire to heal those hurt, and I wish I could show others how much I love them, but then I became disenchanted with the world. I began to estrange myself because I felt unknown and alien, to the extent that I hated humankind and saw other children as frightening monsters. I grew hardened, fell into ruts of gossip and toxicity. I love analyzing people, which was why I would become obsessed with gossip. I also used to be obsessed with others' opinions, to the extent that I would tell my brother not to cry when his friend came over because it was ""impolite"", but over time my mindset completely transformed, and I prefer sincerity to manners (I am not sure if I genuinely felt compelled towards politeness either, or if it was because my teachers had instructed my mom to spend extra time teaching them to me as a child, and I felt that I needed to to be good). Even now, there is something so fascinating by stories and why people act the way that they do, but I didn't realize the weight and cruelty of what I had done, and now I feel imprisoned by guilt for my childhood superficiality. It was only through God that I have grown, uncovered love, and now I feel a potent, unending desire to give it to others, to heal their darkness in the way I healed. I do think that, deep down, I might be a Fe user with high Fi, because I want to give. I want to surrender my entire heart to another person. And I want to transform the world with love. People are so gorgeously intriguing, and it makes me filled with joy. Still, I cannot always understand how to interact with people. I always feel plagued by the same feeling of isolation.

I have never thought of myself as an ISFJ, and it almost hurts to accept, not because I feel ISFJs are unworthy but because it clashes so much with who I believed myself to be. But the truth can hurt, and maybe my eyes have opened to the truth. If there are any other ISFJs who resonate with me or could offer their input, I would be extremely grateful. I feel so lost and such a thirst to find myself, so any opinions at all would be illuminating. Whether I am one of you are not, you are beautiful people. Thank you so much to anyone who can offer guidance :)",1599705207

So, I've been going out with an ISFJ man for 3 months. He has told me that when he talks/dates with one person, he doesn't talk/date with anyone else. He has also answered a direct ""No"" to the ""Are you dating anyone else?"" question. So, the other day, I abruptly sat beside him when he was on his phone. He was looking at an instagram chat, and he quickly showed it to me (weirdly quickly). He was like, this girl is my friend, she posted the story and I replied,hahaha, it's a joke ... mind you, I didn't ask who he was texting too, didn't even see what was being texted (I am shortsighted like that).

The story was about ""whether someone misses me right now"" or smth like that, a quote from somewhere. To which, he replied ""All the time"". The girl had liked his reply. 

I am like, this is not really normal, the context is that you miss her, there is no joke here. He got very defensive and STATED in a very powerful, strict manner that I am being jealous and he is being open because he is showing it to me.

isfj,"To start off - my mom is an amazing person; hard working, caring, will walk to the ends of the earth for her family, etc. Sometimes, however, she gets stuck on certain ideas and beliefs, and that includes a disbelief in mental health.

My younger sister (istp, 14f) needs therapy desperately, but my mom does not see it, and thinks that my sister wants a therapist because it's a trend, or it's the fashionable thing to do. She thinks therapy is only for people who have gone through traumatic life experiences; she just doesn't comprehend mental illness as a concept. She also believes doctors want to make money off their patients, so they'll lie just to keep you coming back. This was actually correct when my dad went to see an expensive quack doctor - from then on, she's been wary. She's also asian, which makes matters worse.

I don't have the money to pay for her therapy on my own, and anyway, I wouldn't want to go behind my mom's back. My sister feels uncomfortable talking about it herself/advocating for herself, which is understandable. My mom would do anything for us if she thinks we'll be better for it, but her resentment of doctors/disbelief in mental health runs deep - she genuinely believes nothing is wrong. So my question is - how do I convince her out of this, without bringing my sister into it?

isfj,"I can't tell if my friend is ISFJ or ESFJ because I'm confident she uses Fe and Si, but I can't tell.

\- She‚Äôs very easily influenced by the people she hangs around, getting into piercings and tattoos because her friends have them, liking raves because her friends attend them, etc.

\- Suspicious by nature, but gullible if she‚Äôs friends with them. She‚Äôll be cautious and skeptical of people‚Äôs intentions and character; however if she knows them personally and they‚Äôre nice to her, she‚Äôll be trusting of them and see everything they do in a good light.

\- Very insecure, constantly compares herself (especially her looks) to others, wants plastic surgery, nitpicks her appearance, and has body dysmorphia. However I feel like she needs validation, so she posts on social media a lot for compliments.

\- Ever since she was a preteen, she‚Äôd get anxious thinking about her future and the future in general.

\- Has anxiety, including social anxiety. She‚Äôs scared of many things such as her grades, quitting jobs, her own driving, transferring schools, changing her hair even though she wants to, paranormal things, the dark, and even eating jelly which is why she‚Äôs only had pb&amp;j once. She also gets paranoid over potential health issues, often self-diagnosing diseases.

\- She‚Äôs really scared of rejection and always wonders if she‚Äôs doing something wrong or annoying people. Another one of her biggest fears is disappointing her loved ones.

\- She feels bad over every little thing, and she said one of her biggest flaws is wanting to explain herself and let her intentions be known, but being too scared to do it.

\- Often hopes for the best but is scared she‚Äôll get her hopes up, yet she assumes the worst then gets torn between the two.

\- Extremely nice, kind girl but is easily taken advantage of. People often tell her she‚Äôs too nice, doesn‚Äôt see her worth, and she has mentioned being nice doesn‚Äôt get her anywhere. She said she‚Äôs over being too nice when she shouldn‚Äôt have been in certain situations. However, she‚Äôs still too nice.

\- Although she‚Äôs really nice, people are often intimidated by her when they haven‚Äôt met her yet because she has a strong resting bitch face.

\- She‚Äôs really shy, quiet, and awkward around strangers. She doesn‚Äôt speak much around people she doesn‚Äôt really know and stutters a lot around them. However she used to always talk about how she wants more friends. Nowadays she isn‚Äôt as shy, but still isn‚Äôt outgoing.

\- Often speaks her opinions on twitter, saying things like how people need to learn manners or how she can‚Äôt stand people who count favors. 

\- She can be stubborn over some opinions, saying those opinions are right. For example, she believes everyone should have their children get vaccination shots. However she said people can‚Äôt see everything one-sided all the time.

\- Stresses how important it is to communicate issues, and can‚Äôt stand when people do things like switch up on her because of something they didn‚Äôt like without addressing the problem with her.

\- Quite sensitive and cries easily. She once talked about complicated customers interrogating her about the restaurant‚Äôs menu and while telling the story, her voice was getting shaky and her eyes were tearing up. She also wants to cry whenever someone raises their voice at her.

\- She said she always gets let down every time she‚Äôs happy, and she thinks that will never change. 

\- She‚Äôs a pretty open person; she might be vague about some things if she doesn‚Äôt know you well, but generally she‚Äôs quite open about her personal life and is willing to answer questions people ask her.

\- She said things change sometimes and it‚Äôs crazy how much can change in just a year. At the same time, she says she needs some change in her life. 

\- She once wanted to apologize to anyone she has ever done wrong and thank those who did her wrong because she grew from each experience and plans on continuing to. 

\- Values friends a lot, sees them as family, and wants to keep them forever. 

\- Loves her family, has a close relationship with them, sees her siblings as best friends, and hates seeing her younger siblings grow up because she wants to keep them young.

\- Can be impatient, sees herself as the most impatient person ever, and can have an attitude at times when she‚Äôs stressed or angry about something (ex: accidentally sassing friends/bf).

\- Hates when people are quick to judge. She won‚Äôt judge someone by their past or reputation until they show that they haven‚Äôt changed a bit.

\- Doesn‚Äôt enjoy continuously thinking about the past, but says that it just happens. However she also hates when people won‚Äôt leave the past in the past, and won‚Äôt accept that she isn‚Äôt who she used to be back then.

\- Her school notes are extremely organized, color-coordinated, and decorated. She procrastinates a lot, but also studies very hard once she starts to the point of studying while cooking. 

\- She cares about making and saving money, but she also has bad spending habits. However she has more savings than other friends and people our age. 

\- She associates a lot of songs with memories and those songs make her feel a certain way. She also feels happy, sad, etc. whenever she sees Snapchat memories. 

\- Her friend (who she wasn‚Äôt close to) recently passed away a few weeks ago. She still thinks of him every day and all the memories they had together, and still gets sad on the daily. 

\- She has a hard time staying single and always wants to be in relationship. She likes hanging out with a lot of friends and enjoys going out with them, but said she‚Äôs an introvert. However she had a hard time staying indoors during quarantine even though she still did.

\- She wants something consistent in life.

\- She laughs at everything, including things that many other people don‚Äôt think are funny.

\- She recently joined a sorority even though she never actually planned to join one because she wanted a fresh start in a new college with a new beginning. She said the sorority is different from what she imagined it to be, and has pushed her to become the person she always wanted to be.

\- She said her sorority brought her out of her comfort zone, opened her eyes to new ideas, taught her to work better with others, and showed her what her own capabilities and independence are",1599522200
isfj,"*Sorry for the long post. I've already tried to summarise this but I have so much thoughts in my head.*

I have been thinking about this ISFJ girl so much and it's really making me tear my hair out based on the mixed signals that she's giving. I don't know if I'm overthinking this and I know there have been threads in this subreddit about how to tell if ISFJs like someone, but this is quite a unique situation, hence the new thread.

**For context:**

* Me: Mid 20s ESFP (although I don't agree 100% with what's described [here](https://www.16personalities.com/esfp-relationships-dating))
* Her: Mid 20s ISFJ (she agrees pretty much with everything described [here](https://www.16personalities.com/isfj-relationships-dating))
* Friends for about 1.5 years now. Started as colleagues. We have gone out a few times now. 3 when I was attached and 3 recently after I broke up. We never label them as dates; just hanging out. I just came out of a relationship that ended amicably in July but I didn't want her to think that she is a rebound. She knew what happened inside out as I confided in her as a friend back then.

**Positive signs:**

* She would try to initiate conversations with me via the company chat, whatsapp and insta DMs almost daily. Sending me posts about cute couples occasionally, songs that she likes, random news articles, asking me IT support questions, telling me she's stressed about work (or are these just convo starters?)
* Laughs at the things I talk about. The hearty kind of laughter. Even via text. However, she's the kind who has many male friends so I'm not sure if she's the same with her close male friends.
* Seems to hint about getting food together but I don't dare to ask if she wants to go out in case I'm misreading the hints
* We went out twice in 2 weeks and when I suggested the 3rd one, she cancelled on me saying she had to do something with a friend but didn't reschedule until 4 weeks later saying she wanted to make up for it.
* My love language is touch so I playfully touch her when we are hanging out and she doesn't seem to pull away but she could be just being polite.
* She told me her love languages were words of affirmation and quality time and that she would really feel better if someone reassures her about her work stress. I used to tease her for being stressed as I never ever got stressed and didn't understand. (could she be hinting how she would like to be loved?)
* When we hang out, we never seem to run out of things to talk about (in fact she she wants to talk so much that I have to ask her to listen to me sometimes) and in the blink of an eye, we would have spent 6-7 hours together. Conversations with her don't feel forceful and it's very comfortable.
* Lots of eye contact. Both of us look each other in the eyes when we speak. Not sustained. Just long enough.
* She told me before that she will never be the first to confess/ask someone if they're interested in her because she doesn't want to assume. However, if the guy confesses and she doesn't feel the same way back, she will let him down nicely and stay friends with him because she knows it takes lots of courage. (not sure if she's hinting me?)
* In our most recent hang out, she saw me struggling with the chopsticks and asked me to pass her my plate so she can do it for me instead. Of course I let her and showed my appreciation for her afterwards. (ISFJs like that right?)
* I playfully said that I've never seen her wear a dress when she last told me that she bought a dress online. The next hangout she wore a dress. And she looked so good but I held back on complimenting her because I was worried she would think I'm being overly flirty.

**Negative signs:**

* There was once when I half jokingly said that she was flirting with me. A few days later she texted saying she asked her friends and they claimed that she isn't the flirty type and told me that if she was flirty she would have grabbed my hand when I tried to hold her hand during one of our hangouts (I didn't). So she basically wanted to make it clear that she wasn't being flirty with me although all my friends think otherwise.
* \[see above\] Cancelled on me and didn't reschedule until 4 weeks later (I've been told that if someone cancels without rescheduling it's usually a bad sign)
* We used to text quite a lot on whatsapp after work into the wee hours of the night but these days, I get blue ticked and we will only text again the next day (is she trying to keep it within office hours?)
* Blue ticks all over the place. She will usually initiate in work chats, insta DMs and whatsapp but then will usually leave me on seen.
* There was once when we hung out and I asked if she had something on after and she said no. So we spent about 9 hours together. After we parted ways she told me that I ""overshot"" by 3 hours.
* Sometimes when I tease her/call her names e.g. silly she will look annoyed but doesn't say anything
* She thinks I don't believe in true love/true love will change as couples age. I just meant to say that as couples go through the different phases in life, their love with evolve, from euphoria/honeymoon stage to a family partner and to a trusted companion etc.

**TL;DR:**

Met this amazing ISFJ girl from work and I thought she used to drop me positive hints while I was attached but seems like she's cut back on it recently. She has told me she takes a long time to evaluate if she sees a future with someone and she will only date that person if she sees a future with him. I really wonder what she thinks of me and I'm getting so confused trying to read her hints but I don't want to confess as we might see each other in the office and it might be awkward. If she gave me more definite hints, I would definitely progress in sync with her. What should I do?",1599491230

isfj,"Hi!

I‚Äôve been reading about MBTI for quite a while now. In the past I always got typed as INFP, but after a while something just didn‚Äôt sit well with me so I started taking tests more and more often. I usually answered the questions based off of my mood, so I basically got typed as majority of I types and once as ENFP, lol.

Recently I realised that no type is better than other, so when taking tests I tried to answer all the questions truthfully, based on my usual behaviour instead of actual mood. In majority of the tests I got typed as ISFJ.

I can relate to a lot of things about ISFJs, but there are some that doesn‚Äôt sound like me at all. I like helping people, but I don‚Äôt feel obliged to help anyone and everyone. I‚Äôm not that reserved, I actually have a big tendency to overshare + I get rid off of my emotions by getting them out of my system, so I often feel the need to talk or write them down. My memory isn‚Äôt good, I don‚Äôt remember things like birthdays etc. I don‚Äôt have that much problems with saying ‚Äûno‚Äù, at least I think?

I tried reading about cognitive functions and while I‚Äôm starting to understand more, there is still a looong way for me haha.

My question is, what should I focus on if I want to be sure about my type? What questions should I ask myself? Or what are the questions you‚Äôd ask someone if you were going to type them? 

In the Keys2Cognition test my functions looked like that: Fi &gt; Si &gt; Fe &gt; Ne &gt; Te &gt; Ti &gt; Se &gt; Ni if that helps. :)

I will be very thankful for any kind of guidance! Of course I don‚Äôt expect anyone to type me (but I‚Äôm willing to answer any questions if someone wants to try haha!) but any kind of tips and advice would be amazing. :) I hope you‚Äôre having a great day!",1599401948

 I usually have just been working a usual part time job and then coming home and never really going out or doing things beyond my home. Not because of the pandemic but in general i dont tend to get out much. Even before the pandemic i just liked sitting at home, laying down on the couch or my bed and either playing a nice game, listening to music, or watching something off YouTube or a streaming site. Most of my  socializing is with customers and co-workers at work or online chat groups I've been in for years.

isfj,"I can't quite explain why, but since I moved to Texas I've had a hard time attracting good-natured feelers.

To give a little background, I'm from a lil surf town in California where there were a lot of xxfx/feelers. My elementary school was made up of 20 kids and was in a house, our teachers were really cool people that taught us conflict resolution. I felt deeply cared for, which was great since I cared deeply for the world. It felt mutual. (Some highlights from my childhood included making encouraging signs and cheering for people when they exited the grocery store and singing John Lennon's ""Give peace a chance"" at the winter concert.)
It really was an ideal environment for an ISFJ with emotionally absent parents. Here's where I feel lost: after I moved, I didn't recieve emotional care. I went to a public school and lived like many people do, with teachers who really don't care, bullies, and TEACHERS who are bullies. Long story short, I refused to go to school after a month or so because it was getting painful to endure daily.

Fast forward to adulthood. I had to cut energy vampires out of the picture, which is most of my biological family. I want to be a part of a village again, but like I mentioned earlier, I've struggled to find and attract good-natured feelers. It's hard to explain this type of loneliness, but I feel it immensely.  I would like to know if anyone else feels lost, because I have yet to find out how to navigate my way through this.",1599258615
isfj,"I'm about to start my first year as a high-school teacher and I've been so anxious and stressed lately...To be fair, I've had experience teaching before, but the environment was different and the hours were far less. Even then, the thought of entering a class with 30 or so faces and having to keep things interesting while maintaining order for like a whole hour seemed daunting. Now, especially with this pandemic, teachers are expected to get all innovative and creative and jump through rings of fire with distance learning, so as to achieve the same results as before, when teachers had face-to-face classes. 

It doesn't even matter that I might not be physically there for the first couple of months. With distance learning, I have to contend with the fact that parents will be watching and I'll be regularly evaluated as a new teacher. So basically, I'm asking for advice from all the ISFJ teachers out there. How did you cope when starting out? How did you pace yourself so as to avoid burnout?

isfj,"Hello everyone.  I need another person's perspective because I'm finding it increasingly more difficult to continue streaming for a variety of reasons.  However, this particular one depresses me.

For some context, I started streaming a couple years ago, but later destroyed my laptop and have been out of commission for a year.  Though I have been streaming from time to time on my PS4.  I'm working towards getting a new one but due to Covid and family circumstances money has been tight for awhile.
It took me a year to reach 150 followers.  However... my ex GF just started streaming a couple months ago and is about to reach my number with an average amount of viewers I've never experienced in my short streaming life.  Not only that but she managed to amass a huge amount of money to finance her streaming career (some $600) before hand.  I honestly can't fathom getting nearly that money from friends for such a non essential hobby, especially during Covid.  Hell, she reached affiliate in less than a week of starting.

It's a difficult pill to swallow because I've worked so freaking hard to get to where I am now.  I had such a passion for what I was doing.  Meticulously going over every detail and refining my content to make it more enjoyable for viewers.  With over 750 hours of streaming under my belt I made a total of around $350 from my supporters.  It wasn't much, but it didn't have to be. 

Now, it feels like my efforts were trivialized.  Yeah, female streamers have an easier time on Twitch than that guy's on average, but I didn't think that the difference would be so wide.  It communicates to me that working hard for what you love doesn't really mean much at the end of the day.  As someone who's constantly fighting depression this takes a huge toll on me and my gender dysphoria.

This is more of a vent than anything, but I'd love to hear your perspective on the matter.

isfj,"So this is a discussion that I would love to explore with you guys. Sorry for the long post.
I recently asked a question about why ISFJs are disliked by a lot of INTJs and how most of the time INTJs have a stereotypical view of us that I personally have not related to even though I KNOW I‚Äôm ISFJ.
Such as that we are very traditional, or not open to try new ways of doing things, or can‚Äôt get into deep conversations etc... all these didn‚Äôt resonate and anytime I read about it I just didn‚Äôt get it cause I‚Äôm not traditional heck I have challenged most traditions that my mother (ESFP) has tried to put on me eg: sex before marriage, marriage being very important, having children and raising a family (I‚Äôm not even sure if I‚Äôm open to it yet), being the dutiful wife and staying in line and many more societal norms that are expected of me.
Also most ISFJ stereotypes say that we would be most likely the type that stays in the same country/city we grew up in due to low Ne, and not wanting to get out of our comfort zones. Except I‚Äôm the opposite, I could literally quit my job today and move to a whole new country just because and I‚Äôve lived and travelled a lot already. 
I can have deep conversations about philosophy, technology‚Äôs exponential growth etc... bla bla bla.
I love all these topics and would love to talk and debate with people. Anyways I think you get the point. So as I was thinking deeper into this I realized that ALL the people I‚Äôm THE closest to or have influenced me in some way ALL my life are all 100% intuitives. My siblings, my best friend, my boyfriend now too (intj). I couldn‚Äôt even stand speaking to my ex (ESFP) because he couldn‚Äôt get deep enough about anything and that was a complete turn off among other things, but he‚Äôs the first sensor I‚Äôve ever dated and I kinda realized I‚Äôm not into sensors (not by choice just coincidentally)
Which makes me wonder if this is why I could be a bit different from the stereotypes because I was surrounded and influenced by intuitives? 
I mean it‚Äôs like I just had an Ah ha moment. 
Anyways a rumbled a lot.

So yeah what do you guys think? Do you think that a sensor around many intuitives or intuitive around many sensors can influence how a person may develop their personality and could potentially make them stand apart from their intuitive/sensor counterparts?
 
TL,DR: how do you think a sensor could develop differently if raised by intuitives and vice versa?",1599098850
isfj,"Context: I'm trying to make a good, function-based test. The idea is, for every pair of functions that share something (i.e. Ti and Fi, Te and Ti) there's a statement for each function, representing the difference and the similarity between the two.

In the midst of this task, I realised I don't really understand Si, I don't know how it works or how anyone would find it useful or attractive. Hence, I'm looking for basically a quick explanation of said questions, and/or sentences that fit the test for Ni and Si or Si and Se, without being aggressive, ambiguous or technically incorrect. I'm asking here because people here are Si doms and should know more about this stuff. Thanks for any suggestions! :)

isfj,"It's my first post, please allow me to rave a bit and forgive me for my poor english (not my first language, but at least you don't have to listen to my accent). 

I have always been very geeky and laid back so when all the tests I did in the past years said I was an INTP I didn't question it too much. Seemed close enough, maybe being a female made my lesser Fe develop faster (which *is* an existing theory).

Over the past six months, mostly thanks to the quarantine, I started learning about the Jungian functions and I spent a lot of time studying them. Now I won't say that I'm an expert on the matter (not even remotely) but I know for sure that I *am not* (and never have been) a Ti-Dom. I am, in fact, an ISFJ. Honestly, before learning how functions worked, I would never have considered myself a SJ. Never. Now I aknowledge that the Si-Fe-Ti-Ne stack represent me perfectly. Especially now that I'm in a very happy and fulfilling moment of my life (loving, committed life partner, fun, stable job, good mental hygiene) and my lesser functions aren't boycotting me.

Earlier, I was basing all my knowledge solely on the four MBTI letters combinations and I've been guilty of stereotyping quite a lot. I feel like many people do it, especially on the internet (it's very obvious just by looking at the huge amount of supposedly rare types here on reddit) and most self-assessment tests are flawed, so they don't help either.

And *now* I'll get to the point (sorry for my rant): what was stopping me from even considering ISFJ was the highly stereotyped depiction of it in most of the ""pop"" Myer-Briggs websites (examples: not being open to new experiences, blindly following traditions without questioning them, being stubborn or opinionated and absolutely never daydreaming or procrastinating whatsoever, always 100% efficient, hating trying different foods, etc).

isfj,"So I've always had a problem with having visitors in my house, whether expected or unexpected, even family members whose company I enjoyed. 

It's weird because I end up having conflicted feelings: on one hand, I hate the fact that they've entered into my ""safe haven"" and on the other hand, I don't mind that I get to see them. And I think that it partially has to do with the fact that I always feel the need to serve and make others comfortable, so I will immediately go to the kitchen and pour out drinks and even make a little snack for my visitors, almost out of a sense of duty. And being polite to guests also involves engaging them in conversation, making them feel welcome, you know.... That sort of thing.

But after they've left, I feel like a heavy weight has been lifted off my shoulders. It's like, I can walk around any way, dressed anyhow and do some quiet reading or watch a series or write poems or something. But thus leaves me feeling super guilty and hypocritical because I almost put on a persona of the ""accommodating host"" while deep down I'm wishing I could be doing something else which doesn't involve focusing on other people for a change.

Does anyone feel that way too? Or am I really just a self-centred hypocrite?",1598968034

I graduated with a BS (health science) about a year ago, but have not worked in the healthcare field much since graduating. I was a medical scribe (hell for an hsp), but quit after a couple of weeks because I was having meltdowns after every shift, which is NOT like me at all. I then worked as a medical receptionist and I hardly lasted a week; I was bored to tears and felt very depressed. I'm a highly active, empathetic introvert. I lean ISTJ very often too, and I'm turbulent. My interests are all over the place. I considered becoming a professor, lab technician, medical coder, genetic counselor, and OT or PT. I considered going into the military or joining the PeaceCorps. I just don't know where to start! I feel pressure to get a career right now since I have a bachelors, and I'm back home living with my parents. 

I guess my question is: what healthcare jobs fit with this personality? I have volunteered with nurses, and it was a big no from me. I don't like blood and I get emotionally burned out very easily. I was on track to become a PA (I did organic chem, biologies, etc. and finished with a great GPA), but I'm worried I'll be so overworked in that field. I need something slower paced, autonomous, and meaningful.

isfj,"Hi everyone,

I met a girl at school, me and my friend think that she is an ISFJ, we are both second years student. Most of my friend are from her class because our classes are close together and we have the same schedule, she sometimes hangout with my friends so we met a lot, I've noticed her for a while but we rarely talk, I remembered one time she asked to see my drawing books and it seemed that she liked it.

Recently she kinda wanna talk to me, she say hi to just me when my friends were there. Sometime she sit close to me (just me) but we didn't talk much, we were just watching random videos on social media and we showed our cats and dog's photos.

I think I'm a bit like her because I was in love with a girl like that. Maybe we can be a couple and even if not we can still be good friends so at this time I wanna be friend with her.

But now I don't know if we have a bit distance then or I'm just insercure. She is shy and taciturn but I'm even shier, we smile and say hi when we met, sometime she look back when I look at her and I'm just avoid eye contact. One time she saw me hangout with 2 other girls (actually we are looking for our friend who ran away and crying somewhere), I said hi to her but she seemed upset. I afraid that she think that I don't like her because I'm closer and confident with other girls. Most my friends are extrovert, I'm more confident with them but I'm usually feel shy when I'm talk to introvert people (but I like them more) but I dunno if she know that.

Some days ago my friend said that she is sad because of something about her crush. I don't think that's me, maybe she was already upset because of her crush and that's I feel like we have some distance.

But anyway I still wanna be her friend. I'm really tired of chatting about bullsh\*t things and joking with my extrovert friends, I care about people's thought and feeling more. I'm the one my friends looking for in difficult times so I think if we are friend it would be comfortable for boths and I can help her a lot.

It provides insights and really makes you think about where your life may be, what you may have been through, and gives a little direction on what to do/look out for. You can even put in people you know (you‚Äôll need their full names and birthdays bc somehow it goes off of planetary alignments at birth), to see how similar or different you are from those in your life.

isfj,"Hello all, 

INFP here. I'm seeing a girl who originally typed herself as INTJ, but having known a legit INTJ and seeing discrepancies with her behavior I've come to believe she is a mistype and I suspect is actually an ISFJ.

Several members of my family are ISFJ. My mom, 2 sisters, and I believe my late maternal grandparents as well. 

One common tendency I see among them is excessive caretaking, usually in the form of offering food, favors, or small comforts. Like everytime I visited my mom or grandparents I'd be bombarded with ""Can I get you some [insert food]"" or ""How about a [insert food or nice thing]"" and I'd have to turn down   repeated offers or just give in and start eating something before they'd leave me alone. 

It's not just food though, it can be anything. A blanket, an errand, help carrying something, just lots of unsolicited offers to serve as a caretaker. I always thought these were just parental habits but the girl I'm seeing does the same thing. 

Like every time she gets up she'll ask if I need something along the way. If she goes to the store she'll ask if I need anything while she's there (even though she lives like an hour and a half away and wouldn't get it to me until the next time we meet anyway ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è). She'll often ask if I'm hungry or make me food or provide little favors or plan nice little outings she thinks will make me happy, all unprompted. Lots of small acts of caretaking. 

It's not like it's a bad thing or annoying but it's pretty persistent and habitual.

What's bugging me tho is that she doesn't want to say what's the problem and share it with me. She did said it's not about me at all. But i'm not satisfied with just that.

She said she really don't want to talk about it just because it would make her feel down and sad all over again. However she open up about this same problem to her old friend which makes me a little jealous. She know that friend like more than 10+ years. And for us we've known each other for only slightly over 1 years and just been dating for 2 months. 
But still it makes me feel like I'm not trustworthy enough for her to share her problem with me. I felt so sad. 

I'm also afraid that she will be like this with all her other problems too. If anything i just want to be someone who she can lean on. Her listener when she felt like ranting, lend my shoulder when she felt like crying, give her upmost emotional support to get her get going. I want to face all of these with her. 

What do you guys think i should do and how do i make her trust me more to share her problems with me? 
Also how to cheer up an ISFJ?

It took us a few month to go on our first dates because we were both out of town for work. Then in January we started seeing each other more regularly. COVID hit and I haven't seen him since. He's moved in with his parents to take care of them. I completely understand this.  We try to do video chats but it can get awkward at times. I ask him things, but it takes him a while to share. He can also go much longer without texting than I can. Like upto 2 weeks when we were in lockdown, now it back to regular texting. I still like him, and I don't mind the awkwardness, but sometimes self-doubt creeps up. 

I have two questions-

1) I hear ISFJs take time open up. I guess I am wondering how much time are we talking here- is there a point where I should take this as a lack of interest/ comfort.

isfj,"New to Reddit, joined just so I could post here! I (30F) would say I'm a typical ISFJ.

For half my life, I had an INFJ best friend (30M) who fulfilled all my ISFJ needs - dependable, zero judgement, perfect balance of space vs closeness, just the right kind of humor for any situation. I could let my guard down completely, say aloud all the thoughts that crowd an ISFJ's mental space, and always receive empathy and sometimes a much-needed reality check. And I know I was all those things for him too.

The relationship was always strictly platonic on both ends. We both knew we had an amazing friendship and never needed more from each other. I have been in a serious relationship with my now husband from the age of 16 - husband and best friend are also good friends. Zero trust concerns from husband, he understands my personality and was happy for me to have someone to contemplate life's big questions with (he's an ESFP so I can sometimes get pretty heavy for him when I'm in deep thinking mode). 

Last year, best friend got back together with an ex-girlfriend, and things got pretty serious. She has always known about our friendship and had seemed okay with it in the past. But then she decided he was ""too close"" to me, and long story short, he just stopped being my friend. It's been a year, and I can't ""move on"". I recently heard they got engaged, so I guess it's time to lose all hope of ever regaining that friendship. I am happy for him that he found a romantic partner he wants to spend his life with, and yeah, lifelong romantic love &gt; friendship, so I get it. But, it was 15 years of secure friendship, so letting go for me is easier said than done.

Fellow ISFJs, I need your advice (preferably something other than ""time heals all wounds""). Are you able to handle your ISFJ-ness all on your own? Sometimes my emotions, thoughts, eccentricities etc feel too much for me to manage alone. Husband is supportive of course, but I understand his personality too and know that I don't want to drag him down the way we ISFJs can do to ""happier personalities"" sometimes. Finding a new best friend seems impossible with the constant fear of abandonment, difficulty ""letting people in"", and mourning the loss of that very special connection. Appreciate your thoughts, comments, and help!

**TL;DR: Best friend (INFJ) of 15 years ended the friendship because his partner was uncomfortable. I support his decision and understand it, but I can't get over mourning the loss, even a year after the fact. Advice for a sad ISFJ appreciated!**",1597297525

isfj,"I'm an INFP.

I meet him five years ago, when I was in a bad state emotionally. Yet, even though I could be selfish, he was there for me. He would always include me in stuff, and managed to notice stuff about me, even though I never said anything. However, I feel like I never appreciated how much he took care of me, and I don't know how to tell him I did need it and appreciate it, because he often puts an emotional wall between us, and won't take about emotion.

 I feel like I was never actively mean to someone, but I could say some insensitive stuff that I know hurt him. Like that I wouldn't contact him the long-term; I only said this because I was afraid he wouldn't keep in contact long-term, and I wanted to say it first. I later did say that I missed him, and he was like ""that's not what you said before."" I would sometimes act selfishly around people, and feel like I could rude.

Despite all this, he still kept in contact me after we changed schools. He sent me a lot of messages, but I spent a lot of time not messaging him back. He wanted to meet up, but I was like wait for the vacation. So, I haven't seen him that much. I've read that ISFJ's need quantity over quality, but I haven't given him this. Mostly because I didn't want him to know I don't have a social life, and because I was afraid I would come across as needy, so I ended up replying late to his texts and acting like I didn't want him there as much as he wanted me. The messages has tapered of over time from his side; I think because he's adjusted well, and has a lot of other friends.

The last time I meet him, I dumped a lot of my emotional baggage on him, as in a wrote a long text detailing abuse and sent it to him. I did this because I wanted him to understand me; I wanted him to see their are reasons to why I acted like that all those years, and that his investment in me hasn't been for nothing. But I think at that time I was so sensitive, I became a bit angry at his response. I think he's not good at knowing what to say in emotional situations, and didn't give me the validation I needed.

However, I now realize he did his best. I also  realized I overshared instead of sharing true intimacy with him, and I feel so terrible for dumping my problems on him, and burdening him with my pain, and then blowing up at him when he tried to be kind.

Furthermore, I felt angry at him, and stated that I had felt this for a long time at him, because he never stood up for me when a girl was repeatedly cruel to me. But he said he never did, because he would sometimes cry in such situations, and he wondered if I understood? I stated that I sometimes cried when I was angry, but that I really wanted him to back me up if someone was mean to me, but that I could handle the actual argument (if there was one). However, later I again sent him a long, emotional text saying ""I should have considered his feelings more, and he didn't need to stand up for me if he really felt he couldn't."" But the text was so long, and I was a bit angry, that I don't know if he saw it.

Anyway, I've read here that ISFJs are quite sensitive and emotional inside, and I've been so stupid, because I think I've hurt him sometimes with my words and actions, not realizing at the time that it affected him. He extremely observant and remembers so much, I'm afraid I can't ever change his perfection of me, and become a truly good friend to him.

I remember he said ""people said he was so social and had a lot of friends"", but that he felt they were only surface-level and not real closeness. I asked him if we were close, and I can't remember his faces but he said ""yes, we are."" But I'm afraid he just said this because he knew it meant so much to me, and he didn't want to say his true feelings. He rarely talks about his innermost feelings with me, so I'm always unsure if he's actually close to me.

Lately, I've tried sending him more messages. I've tried opening up some, but he never gives me the validation I need. I try to realize that it's difficult for him to be emotionally supportive with his words, and usually just continue the conversation, even if he doesn't open up to me. I'm planning to buy him a gift; I'm unsure if he'd like it, but I'm trying to make it personal, so even if he doesn't like, he'll know it's from my heart. I thought maybe writing him a letter of telling him in person how sorry I was for some things might be good, but our last meeting was filled with emotional stuff and my anger, so I don't want him to be uncomfortable. Therefore, this might not be a good idea.

Anyway, I want to meet him more often, but I feel a bit inadequate. He's very social, and always travels with his other friends. He never travels with me. I also don't want to bother him, when he might not have the time to meet up, but still meet me just to be nice to me.

What other acts can I do to show him I care about him? Can I ever repair my relationship with him and truly become close?",1597085398
isfj,"Hi everyone, I wanted to get your feedback on these possible facets, or aspects, of Si. Does this idea of facets of Si ring true, based on your experiences with Si?

The deeply introverted facets of Si:

* Internal to me (my own thoughts / recollections which arise from my own experiences)
* Important to me (a recollection is valued based on its impact on me)
* Deep &amp; known mostly to me (difficult to communicate well without going on forever)
* Valid mostly to me (subjective, recollection built on my own perceptions, not typically cross-checked with others' perceptions)
* Valued mostly by me (a recollection may seem to become less significant or less special if I share it with others who do not also indicate that things like this are important to them; I may withhold the information as a way of internally affirming my own gift OR not wanting to appear crazy or weird by valuing this experience)
* Result: Not frequently shared with others, even if they may enjoy hearing about it, or benefit from it

This is mainly working from the ""Si is based on recall of my own past experiences"" model, or theory--I understand that there are different models with different values, but for the purposes of this post I wanted to clarify this--

For comparison, the deeply introverted facets of Ni (these seem valid to me as an INTJ): 

* Internal to me (my own projections into current or future events which arise from my own experiences)
* Important to me (an intuition is valued based on its deeply-felt connection with my past / learning / experiences / imagery or sensations in my mind)
* Deep &amp; known mostly to me (difficult to communicate well without going on forever, connecting things logically for example so that others can understand the conclusion)
* Valid to me (subjective, built on my own perceptions &amp; experiences, not typically cross-checked with others' perceptions)
* Valued mostly by me (an intuition may seem to become less significant or less special if I share it with others who do not also indicate that things like this are important to them;  I may withhold the information as a way of internally affirming my own gift OR not wanting to appear crazy or weird by valuing this intuition)
* Result: Not frequently shared with others, even if they may enjoy hearing about it, or benefit from it

Anyway--I hope this made some sense and would love to get your feedback or input.",1597078762
isfj,"Understanding which environments your personality and behavior is most suited for can be a tricky thing. So many of us are stuck in roles that require us to perform functions that aren‚Äôt completely in our wheelhouse instead of playing to our strengths.

The DISC Personality Theory showed me that I, and everyone else, have a natural predisposition for certain work environments and job functions. It‚Äôs always better to play to your strengths rather than try to compensate for your shortcomings.

Each person‚Äôs type is generally based on how outgoing or reserved they are, and how people-oriented or task-oriented that are.

There are 4 specific types under the DISC model

* Dominant
* Influence
* Supportive
* Conscientious

isfj," Hi fellow ISFJs,

I've taken the test throughout the years and it has always given me ISFJ-A as a result. However, lately it has come to my attention that there are some things that do not apply to me. 

I'm currently 31 and I've traveled a lot throughout my 20s and still do (not now because of Corona), to the point where I ended up living in a different country and continent, far away from where I'm from. I also like trying new things and going on adventures, though I must say mostly related to traveling. I have even traveled alone when no one was able to come with me. I have friends who have commented that I'm very spontaneous because I booked tickets to visit them when they asked me without giving it a second thought. It does not apply to trying extreme sports or something alike. I'm also up for trying new hobbies, I've done boxing, crossfit, bootcamps, or basically if a friend asks me if I want to try something with them I'm in (except extreme sports, they are a bit scary to me). I'm not a planner in a sense that I would not send you a google calendar invite if we agreed on having a movie night with some friends on a Saturday. Or also I do not like to plan my trips by schedule, I like going with the flow. However, I do like booking. Meaning I like to know I'm meeting you that day and at that time. I used to live in a country where spontaneity was easy, people were quite flexible so I wouldn't usually have a planned schedule. However, when I moved countries I realized people in this country plan everything. You can't ask them to hang out a day before or plan a birthday just a few days in advance because people here are booked weeks in advance. So I think I've adapted into keeping my weekends planned as well, in order not to be left out.

Also, I actually like change. Since I have an office job it is hard to be spontaneous with the 8am-5pm work schedule, but I do not like to do the same thing at work. And when I feel I've learned what I had to learn or that there is no room for me to grow anymore I have no issue in changing jobs. I currently work as a consultant and I have to say that most of the time I'm out of my comfort zone, which I prefer, I don't like to do the same thing over and over again, because I get bored and die. Just kidding. However, I do not mind that much to have a routine from Monday to Thursday. I like to know I will be working and that at this time I will go to the gym, and that on Wednesdays I have dancing class and so on.

And finally, according to my sister I can't sit still. If I have a free day I need to do things. Not with people necessarily, but I like to keep busy and can't be at home doing nothing. I like staying active, either with little projects to accomplish, exercising, going on hikes or meeting friends. I enjoy spending time with my friends, the only thing is that I get tired after a while.

From what I've read since Ne is our inferior function, we are supposed to like routine and avoid change. But I can honestly say I do not feel this describes me. Could it be that my Ne is more developed? From what  I understood, you get to develop this more during your 40s, maybe I did it earlier? I can relate to the other functions like Si, Fe and Ti a lot and after reading the ISFJ personality I do feel like I can relate too. So I was wondering if there are other ISFjs in the same boat as me?

Thank you for taking the time to reply :)

p.s: Sorry for the long post!",1597069215
isfj,"So I‚Äôm an ISFJ and generally I don‚Äôt like attention and feel uncomfortable when it‚Äôs profusely given to me. However I recently realized that I tend to be more attracted in guys who do NOT give everyone else attention except me??
As in I dated an ESFP once and he just HAD to talk to everyone, all the time, or kind of ask for attention from everyone and need it and that was one of the biggest turn offs for me among other things.

I am attracted to a guy who isn‚Äôt was easily accessible to others, especially if they aren‚Äôt close to him or something. But then he is accessible to me and gives me his undivided attention. Makes me feel special in some way and this kind of attention I value more.

Not sure if any of you relate to this? Or maybe it‚Äôs just a me thing lol",1597019747

isfj,"so nothing ACTUALLY (no argument) happened directly to cause this, but basically this dude that liked me all of a sudden started taking a whole day to respond to a single text message. it's also liek what because we talked normally and were on good terms. but considering he used to respond pretty quickly for the past few months and now, he's all of a sudden taking a day. so I was getting the message like ok- seems like he doesn't want to talk to me anymore. so then I stopped to see if he'd ever initiate a convo- and then I never heard from him again. 

My best conclusion is that  I think I wore him out with my spontaneity (im ISFP) and considering nothing could happen between us anyway, he just gave up. And I think he wants to get over me because of this/ impracticality of our situation.

But I guess what frustrates me the most is the lack of closure and communication. And I've been told by a friend that I should just leave him alone because me asking him about this isn't going to solve anything or necessarily change his thoughts or my thoughts.",1597012377

isfj,"Well... where to begin? I guess i'll start with me... I'm a 24yo male isfp, i have not always been an isfp i have changed a lot over the last 3/4 years, i was originally an isfj when i was 20/21 then became an esfj and then esfp and now i'm an isfp i don't quite understand why it or I have changed quite that much but i digress.

The reason i have come to you today at half 2 in the morning is because i can't decide whether or not i should make another move or not and its keeping me up of course. 

I have been online 'dating' (thanks covid) for the best part of 8 months, despite several months of not going anywhere I have had the odd date here and there be it in person or a video call. Most recently, last weekend I went on an in-person date to a pick your own farm with a nice isfj girl (I'll call her Amber) it went rather well and as agreed upon before said date we had agreed we would play some games online as Amber wanted to go slow if the date went well, at the end of the date we acknowledged that it did go quite well but that we were both a little quiet.

Fast forward a couple days after and i've noticed that Amber has become a lot more busy with work (as she had previously told me would happen) and has a lot less time to chat and although i completely understand this i started to feel stressed and anxious. I do have a past with anxiety but have learned how to cope with it better than i use to and i decided to educate myself a little more about what Amber did for a living to help my own understanding and ease my anxiety. I mention to her that it would be better if she were to message me when she had time. Amber got back to me minutes later saying that this was why she didn't really date, as her work will always come first, Amber works as an I.T speacialist for a big hotel and is essentially on-call 24/7, a reasonable explanation i thought, so i decided to say that i now understood just how slow she would need to go and that i was happy with it if she was... oh boy was i wrong as it would turn out she was finding work very stressful and wasnt really enjoying dating or even talking (having previously dated another introverted girl in the past i am aware that introverts require their own space and was not hurt on hearing/reading this) she went on to say that she felt she was too busy to continue dating or talking and that she may try again when things calm down for her at work and that she hoped i could understand that (which I do.)

I told her that i understood and that i had enjoyed the date and that she could call me if she found the time in a few months. I was disheartened, and a little sad for the next couple of days and struggled to really focus at work but then on the 3rd day i was okay and even feeling more confident than i have done in a long time, and was very productive at work, for what reason i do not know; but i do know that Amber is the girl for me, there had definately been a connection before the date... we had acknowledged that neither of us do well with first dates maybe i should try again, so that ladies and gentlemen leaves me here with some questions.

Is it too late for me? Do i still have time to turn this nice but somewhat lacking date around?

If so, when? Amber is a busy and 'hard to get' person and has said she may try again in a few months... and thats fine but i wouldn't want her to forget me, i don't think she would but i wouldn't put it past her to think that i would move on... and may think i'm not interested when in reality i am very much so as the other dates have not made me feel this way, the other dates did not give me the same feeling whatsoever...

So any advice would be appreciated",1596939884
isfj,"Hi, there‚Äôs an ISFJ guy who does regular home maintenance work for me, who I‚Äôm super (and I mean super) attracted to. We are around the same age - late 30s. I‚Äôm wondering whether he feels the same way about me. The signs that indicate he likes me are: 
- the moment we met, I felt that instant mutual attraction when you know that you‚Äôre both attracted to each other
- he gets nervous around me, ie stumbles his words, sweats, gets awkward and moves position (ie. when I asked him a question he tried to casually lean against the wall, then seemed to realise he looked awkward, so had to change position)
- he stares at me doe-eyed, with his head tilted downwards, his eyes looking up at me 
- he always focuses intently on what I say
- he always makes time for me, comes around whenever I ask him to
- every time he arrives he apologises in some way, like ‚Äúsorry for the late notice, I was just in your area so wanted to see if I could come‚Äù 
- he is almost intuitive in the way he picks up when I need him to help me out
- he always replies to my texts within 5‚Äì10 minutes
- he smiles at me, sometimes huge, warm smiles
- I feel genuine warmth and kindness from him
- I once noticed him do a quick micro-glance down at my body while I was talking
- he stares into my eyes a lot 

But...there are signs that he‚Äôs not interested too, these being:
- he doesn‚Äôt initiate or extend conversations 
- he never asks me anything about myself 
- he almost seems in a hurry to leave once he‚Äôs finished his work 
- he doesn‚Äôt engage in any overt flirting (just the eyes, body language etc)
- he never accepts my offer of a drink of water or coffee 

I‚Äôm wondering whether the signs that he likes me are actually just normal behaviours from ISFJ guys towards everyone, and in particular because I am a customer/client of his business, that he‚Äôs just submissive and eager to please every customer? I‚Äôm fairly sure he has low self-esteem, which actually just endears him to me further, as he is such a kind, humble, lovely guy. I really hope he feels the same way about me, but I just wonder why he would not try to initiate or extend conversations with me if he liked me? Even if he‚Äôs shy, I would have thought attraction would override that. I‚Äôm shy myself (INFP) but my attraction to him makes me more bold towards him. 

Also, perhaps the fact that I like him is obvious and that in itself makes him nervous and uncomfortable as he doesn‚Äôt like me back? 

Hope someone can help! I‚Äôm thinking about him a lot but don‚Äôt want to waste my time if he really isn‚Äôt interested. Thanks:)",1596894579

There is some negativity in here about XNTP and ISFJ but horribly embarrassing as it is some other combinations sadly might have disconnected by now.

isfj,"I have have had to resit my third year at university due to severe mental health problems stemming from childhood. My father cannot understand my logic and how integral he is to my pain and the abuse I suffered when I was five and six. He ALWAYS comes across as holier-than-thou and self-righteous, as though he knows me better than I know myself. He also complains that I am dependent on him, however, he, in the past, has made me feel worthless for speaking my mind and for showing independent thought. He brainwashed me into believing his opinions were fact, and still believes and thinks this way to this day. What is worse is when I show more dependency my father tells me to stop being dependent, and at that point find myself stuck in a catch 22 situation. I also find him very emotionally manipulative, but when I accuse him of this, he accuses me of the same thing. I also have a younger sister who experienced the same hostile childhood as myself and she is in an even worse state than me. 

Bottom line is my dad constantly wants more from me, he is never satisfied. When I brought up the idea of a gap year during my second year he said no, and acted as though he had control over me, despite me at the time being 19. I also told him how crippling my mental health was. I barely passed. I do think my narcissistic step mother has ahold of him, as my dad changed after my mothers passing, and more so when he started dating my step mother ten years ago. 

I came her to seek out advice, as my dad seems like an unhealthy ISFJ. He was an amazing father before my mum passed, so sad. I miss the true him. His judgements are so brutal these days, nothing pleases him.

I care about him a lot which is why after a couple failed attempts (I have relationship anxiety) we decided to try it out slowly. I usually try to understand things mentally before emotionally but rn my emotions are 100% on board and my mind is not. Which is the issue. 






I have a hard time connecting w him. He can't sustain a conversation and we don't have the same hobbies so that's out as far as conversation goes. I'm trying to bridge the gap and he's down for whatever I show him but our passions are very different. He lives and breathes cars, while I'm creative in about every aspect I can manage to be creative in. We've liked each other since we were 15 and 16 (I'm 22, he's 21 we've known each other since 14 and 15). 











My conversations are usually creative banter and wise cracking and he's very to the point and simple in his conversations. So I make him laugh with my comments about training an army of dogs that will help me rise to the top of a utopian society that establishes its elites based on being double jointed and other strange and insignificant talents... Idk maybe someone can explain this disconnect in Myers Briggs terms, so I can figure out how to bridge the gap?

isfj,"Okay...so...i had a date with a wonderful and unique isfj woman, this is what happened:

I know this person for over a year now and asked her out on a date, she agreed.
I'm the ""affectionate touchy touchy type"" which means, that I love some body contact, like sitting close together, holding hands, even kissing, if it feels right, which it does (for me, otherwise I usually wouldn't go on a date with you).
However, I completely respect, that another being can approach dating differently, and I noticed real fast, that she was shy about making light contact. So I tried to approach the first date real slowly, we spent time together I enjoyed, so I tried holding hands, which she ""accepted"" for a brief moment the first and not at all at the second time, so I didn't try that a third time.
Since the second time didn't seem to work out for her, I didn't try anything else and we just kept chatting.
Nonetheless, I asked her out on a second date, and I told her, twenty minutes before the date ended, that she could think about her answer, since I didn't want to stress her. Arriving at her home, she did not really seem to have made up her mind about the topic, so I asked her again...after some ""I don't know's""... She declined and asked me to just be good friends.

So the next day she sent me a voice mail, which I didn't listen to, because I thought it was about ""being friends"" again. So she texted me today, saying, that she would like to go on a second date and that the situation back then was a bit too much for her, even apologizing.

What would you isfj's say? Is she trying to just be polite? Am I approaching her too fast? What is your opinion?

isfj,"I‚Äôve been feeling a productivity slump after working from home for so many months. There‚Äôs even been research that has shown a 7% decline in productivity across the US since the pandemic started. It can even be tricky to enter a state of flow.

Even though, there seems to be a lot more time to do things like bake bread, redecorate your home, etc. There are times when you don‚Äôt feel like doing anything either, but this often tends to be couple with guilt that you aren‚Äôt doing enough during this time. However, it‚Äôs even more important to realize that it‚Äôs perfectly fine to not want to do anything at all because these are, in fact, uncertain times!

What‚Äôs worked for me is to revisit my goals and focus my energy towards my passions and the things that matter most, instead of trying to just get things done. I‚Äôve detailed this more here - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEHPmpMegU&amp;](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEHPmpMegU&amp;) .

isfj,"Hello! One of my best friend is an ISFJ and she wants to become an author. She is very talented and has a vivid imagination. We both hold the credible theory that Fuyumi Ono is an ISFJ herself (my friend got to know her books as a teenager and loved them a lot, her heroine from The Twelve Kingdoms also look a lot like her), but she is so far the only author I have ever come across that was most likely an ISFJ.

I would love for her to have more material to believe in her capacities and follow her dreams, because I think she has the potential do so something incredible. I also personally love reading ISFJs' writings because it is very close to who you are in general, as you are very connected to personal sensations (another ISFJ friend of mine writes as well), and I think imagination offer natural good aspects of what people value and love (and I love psychology and understanding people).

isfj,"As a true ISFJ, I've always been compromising and accommodating when it comes to conflict. However, I've grown to get better  at creating boundaries and resolve conflict via in person conversation, at least with the closest people in my life such as my husband, my parents, and my brother.

However, i can never bring myself to resolve conflict in person with my cousins. For context, I'm the youngest cousin in the family. So whenever something bothers me, I'm quick to just let it go. However recently, a conflict between me and my cousin appeared and i composed a rather long text message telling her how i feel. she did not text me back, in fact, she started disconnecting with me in all social media. Until yesterday, she texted me and say i need to really grow up and be mature about this whole thing. instead of writing her a text message, i should've called her and talk to her in person. 

I admit that was wrong of me, but i chose to text her at that time because there's so much i needed to tell her. and this is not just those text that i typed angrily. i actually opened up my notes app, type it, and redo it a few times. 

is it so wrong to confront someone over text, even if the text is carefully crafted? i didn't call her names or anything, i just laid out exactly why i'm feeling this way. 

i tried to put myself in her shoes and honestly, if she would've sent me a long text letting me how she feels about the conflict, i would not be bothered. i'd just be happy that she is letting me know. or maybe i'm just different ...",1596230322

First time was to go eat ice-cream (just the two of us, I really wanted to get to know her). She said she was busy with work ‚Äúso let‚Äôs see‚Äù. She might have been indeed busy, she comes across as really industrious and responsible, so I was like okay never mind. Two weeks later I texted her again and asked whether she wanted to go eat ramen (she likes ramen). Silent treatment. Asked her to hang out a third time. Again, silent treatment. 

I thought she might actually not like me but in the past she would always smile when she saw me in the university library and one time when I praised her for her conscientiousness she responded she appreciated that, especially since the praise was coming from someone like me (I‚Äôm not even half as hard-working as she is but I‚Äôm pretty good at public speaking and having that skill apparently impresses her). We've known each other for like 2 years already and also had several classes together in the past.

What do you guys think? Is she just super super shy? If so, how do I ask her to hang out?

1. how would you (isfj women) like a first date to be/ what would you wish for on a first date?
2. as I've read some texts about isfj's: personally, I tend to only go on dates, if I already like someone: would you consider light body contact, holding hands, soft touches etc as too harsh or as sweet and comfortable (if you like your dating partner)?
3. if the mood is right or at the end of the date: do you consider a kiss as too aggressive or would you enjoy that? (if the mood feels right).
4. I enjoy flirting a lot, do you enjoy sweet talk as well? Does the isfj woman usually flirt back? And if so, what are the signals to watch out for?
5. What are other things you casually enjoy? For example, do you like honest compliements?

isfj,"Hi everyone! It‚Äôs my first time posting here but I‚Äôve skimmed through posts and the wiki. I wanted to seek some advice from an ISFJ(s)
I‚Äôve been talking to this potential partner for a few months now, and in the beginning I‚Äôve already felt this huge wall that is preventing me from trying to get to know them. In the past, as an ENTJ, if I dont see any potential in the other person, I would quickly drop them and move on. Well, we‚Äôve only been talking for about 6 months and not officially dating. This ISFJ is very shy and has said openly said so. Through the almost 6 months of talking, I felt like we were making progress slowly but surely- even planning to meet since we live 2 states apart. 
I‚Äôve managed to get this person to speak on the phone a few times recently but over the past weekend, when I had ask to call them, I was turned down twice. Now, my ego was kind of hurt by the dismissal so I confronted the issue. I said ‚ÄúWell we‚Äôve talked on the phone before so I dont understand why we cant talk now. It just feels like the walls I‚Äôve worked hard to get through are now back up, and they are much taller, bigger and stronger.‚Äù I was met with resistance and total shutdown. The response I received was ‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to balance everything going on- between work, and my bestfriend venting to me. Can we just text for now? Just a little more?‚Äù 

I stopped responding and now I feel like crap because I probably overwhelmed them and wont ever talk to me again. 

For you ISFJs, do you all think ENTJs can be overbearing? Specifically, do you think what I did  probably overwhelmed them? And if so, what do you recommend the best course of action be? Leave them be for now until they ‚Äúrecharge‚Äù their battery (per the Wiki) or reach out and apologize?

It goes along with Si because it is a calming, detail oriented process for example, one needs to be careful in making the right measurements, and it involves a lot of repetitive tasks like mixing things or cutting cookie shapes.

This was my description for the poll (don't attack me. it's something i genuinely struggle with and am trying to fix):

When a semi attractive person acts kind of nice to me one time, I romanticize it until I fall in love with the idealized version of them in my own mind and not actually who they are in real life. Then I get to know them more and after I fall ""out of love"", I cringe and I'm like - why did I ever like this person? I must have been insane. And it was because I had fallen in love with the idea of someone they could be that they actually weren't but I was just blinded by my romanticized view of them to see the reality of who they were.

It happens to me so often that for almost all of my past ""crushes"", I'm cringing and thinking to myself - how could I have ever liked this person?

ISFJ Anime Characters list:

Ryuji from Toradora - When I think of a ISFJ anime character this is actually the one I think of first everytime. This one is kind of personal too because my ISFJ friend Ryan loves this character and relates to him as a fellow ISFJ greatly. Ryuji is detailed oriented, nitpicky, remembers things in great detail and emotionally supportive and caring and always thinks of other people's emotions and emotional state. He worries a lot for Taiga and anything that could go wrong with his Ne inferior and hates taking risks when ever necessary. Ryuji is the best ISFJ from Torodora and his love and obsession of cleaning is hilarious and awesome train in him. Great and amazing character and amazing show as for Toradora, probably the best romance anime I've ever seen personally.

Krillin - Where do I start with Krillin, the OG ISFJ. Krillin is driven by duty with Si and friendship and caring and emotionally supportive with his Fe aux behavior. He's loyal with his Si to his friends and well help them with his Fe anyway he can and can do at the time. People get on him and roast him often for being weak or useless but this stereotype couldn't be farther from the truth. Krillin has been keeping up with them and the fellow Z fighters for years in the series. He managed to beat the Saibamen on his own and avenge Yamcha's death from them that Nappa and Vegeta brought with them. He remembers details to absurb and large degree with his Si dom. And he worries a lot what will happen and fears negative possibilities with his Ne inferior function. He cares a lot about Si security and hates risk taking, almost to the point of cowardice yes but again I said before, despite this Si security and scared risk and cowardice in him and his character Krillin always stands up to do what's right and jumps in to save the day, or try and help people when he can. He stood up and fought Frieza himself and blasted him several times, he worked together with Gohan and Vegeta to fight Frieza, he teamed up with Gohan the whole Namek arc to fight like the Ginyu force and Captain Ginyu himself. He also stood up to the Cell Jrs and even tried to help Cell himself even when his Si said don't do it any take the risk, he went in anyway and tried to help once Piccolo went to jump in. He even states Goku's idealism for trying to save the day against all odds is rubbing off on him, which is ironic because Goku is an idealistic ENFP and his Ne always sees a possibility to win and stand up and try to do something to beat opponnent against impossible odds because Goku always sees the possibility to beat a strong opponent with his Ne and Fi too, this directly correlates with Krillin's Si security himself, which is the opposite function to Ne. So Krillin is admitting basically to using a function he isn't even used to or likes to use in this scene with his inferior Ne. Anyways Krillin's the best and don't let anyone tell you other wise, he's an extroverted introvert which makes sense because ISFJs and INFJs are the most extroverted introverts because of Fe which is no different from Krillin and his extroverted moments as a introvert for Krillin himself. But don't be fooled, he's not ESFJ at all, Krillin is ISFJ definitely. Krillin always remembers details from the past all the time with his Si dom behavior, he remembered what Vegeta said earlier along with Nappa and what they said about the Dragon Ball's earlier and what they said about Piccolo and being able to find out a new planet to find them on, the thought about this past detail to a large degree with his Si and then came up with the Ne idea after thinking about it a lot of maybe Piccolo can be brought back and everyone saved after all if try to go to this planet where these Namekian people live, they might have Dragon Ball's themselves to bring our friends back, which turns out being completely true. Krillin remembered with his Si the Kami were once one and the same and then careful observed and remembered what direction Piccolo flew in and told Tien he's going in the direction of the lookout to fuse with Kami permanently, massive Si observation and memory from Krillin here again. Overall though despite his few ideas he comes up with his Ne inferior here and there, Krillin hates Ne overall and again fears negative possibilities from happening in the future to an absurd degree and wants to play things safe with his Si and what's worked before in the past as a Si dom himself. Krillin is underappreciated for his efforts sadly which is a ISFJ stereotype but we love him and his character and bravery despite his fear and he will always be one of the greatest sidekick characters and most loyal and helpful friends to Goku and the other Z fighters ever in all of time. Here's a good character analysis on Krillin down below and Krillin put as a ISFJ on the Dragon Ball Z Chart, as usual I always say and tell people in my opinion this chart is very accurate for an anime MBTI Chart. It's one of the best anime MBTI charts ever and is very, very accurate and correct with the characters typings on here in my opinion, the only thing I disagree with and two characters I always say are wrong in my opinion are Videl and Android 16. In my opinion Videl is definitely ENTJ and Android 16 is definitely ISFJ. But all the other character types are right and spot on for sure on the Dragon Ball Z MBTI chart down below in my opinion and many other people's opinions as well. Check it out here if your interested in checking the DBZ MBTI chart out for yourself and the video for Krillin's character analysis by Nick M will also be posted here down below:

Coby - One Piece characters you gotta love, and Coby in my opinion is no different. Overall most people love Coby and his character, you have your haters out there because of his cowardice too but hey he's still a great guy and character, give the guy some slack. Coby is awesome and dutiful with his Si values for honor, tradition, caring for rules, and his duty as a Marine to a huge degree and taking it seriously more than anyone. Coby loves helping others and is a very emotionally supportive person. He's calm and level headed. He cares for society values and believes in respect and manners and being emotional supportive as much as possible to others. He's humble and appreciative, he over worries a lot like Si doms and SJs do with his inferior Ne fearing possibilities happening possibly in the future. He cares a lot about Si security, we see this with his freaking out when he's introduced in the story and him panicking the Luffy is doing something stupid and risky and scary that could get them in trouble or hurt from someone. We see another Ne Si dynamic here. Luffy is an ENFP and big Ne dom dreamer character who's going after his dream idealistic as an NF and ENFP with his Ne dom behavior because Luffy's Ne sees the possibility of doing so for going after the One Piece and then achieving his Pirate King dream in the future. Coby initially rejects this dream and says ""never never never, it's impossible"" showing his Ne inferior and Si security again and thinking its impossible to do things especially really risky and crazy idealistic things and trying to achieve crazy big dreams that seem impossible to the average person like him. Luffy says I don't care and if I die, I die. At least I tried going for it and my dream, Luffy's Ne seeing the possibility to do it and follow his dream and his Fi believing in his heart he can do it, decides to go after the One Piece and become Pirate King, no matter what people say and other people saying its impossible to do that like Coby is telling Luffy here. Once Coby hears this, he gets inspired and then stands up and thinks about his dream and yells it out loud and says I want to become a Marine one day and a great one at that. His inferior Ne is sparked by Luffy's dom Ne and idealistic and inspiring happy go lucky ENFP spirit and then he decides to go for it after all and say screw risk even if he normally hates that and hates risking taking with his Si dom security function. Everything works out they leave Alvida's ship, fast forward to the end of the Captain Morgan arc and Luffy's quick Ne idea and plan he came up with of hitting Coby to make it look like they weren't friends works and Coby stands up and asks to join the Marines, they send Luffy of with a vow and salute of friendship and then Coby gets trained and becomes a splendid Marine over time and moves through the ranks. He eventually states his Admiral dream to Luffy and then Luffy accepts and says you have to get that strong if your gonna capture me right? So go do and fulfill that dream and get stronger to achieve it in the future Luffy says and he tells Zoro he believes in Coby and knows he can do it one day. Coby leaves after crying and says he's gonna get stronger and do it and achieve that dream afterall. He came a long way and is a very interested and great ISFJ anime character should be be praised and loved for his contributions an depth he adds to the story of One Piece. He's an OG and he appeared on the first episode with Luffy and Alvida both, its Coby, everybody knows Coby, we love him and want to watch him succeed and build his confidence to be a splendid Marine. You can do it Coby, we believe in you.

Nefertari Vivi - Another One Piece character, haha. Vivi is an amazing character, most people know this. She's driven her Si duty as a princess, loves her people and cares deeply for others. She reads peoples emotions easily and is very emotionally supportive person. She's calm, introverted, and is a level headed person. She hates taking risks with his Ne inferior fearing negative possibilities all the time and can't understand in the beginning why Luffy and the other crew members like taking such crazy risks all the time. Si security is everything to her and playing things safe as much as possible. When she arrives on Alabasta she's overblown my memories from the past from every place she visits with his Si. Any person would get memories revisiting their hometown but Vivi clearly does it in a Si way and Si dom behavior and manner for sure with the amount of past details she remembers with her Si and treasuring and remembering past experiences with the places she's been in her homeland while they travel Alabasta and go to different places she grew up or talk about with her Si dom detailed memory of everything in Alabasta she knows and the places she's been as a kid there. She cares for society values and respect and manners, relates heavily to Nami who is ESFJ, there both Se users and SFJs so they get along pretty quickly as friends being ISFJ and ESFJ both themselves. She's political and involved in society and politically important matters, she takes them and these meetings at the Reverie very seriously and even made friends with Rebecca and Shirahoshi in an instant with his aux Fe easily connecting with them and emotionally bonding with them easily there. She clearly remembers people like Wapol when he shows up and holds a grudge to him for everything she did like she did when she grudged against Crocodile with her Si for everythign he did to her people in the Alabasta Arc. I don't think theres much more to say, its Vivi, she's an amazing character and an honorary straw hat in spirit for a lot of One Piece fans. She's amazing and such a lovable character that its not even funny. Always will love Vivi and here character, she's like family to One Piece fans and the Straw Hats, Oda did such an amazing job making us care and love for a what would like a side character aboard the Straw Hat ship the Going Merry in the whole entire Alabasta arc and saga. Overall Vivi is such an amazing and well written and great character that I don't know what else to say. If you want to see an even more in depth analysis on Vivi and her as an ISFJ in One Piece, check out my character analysis below here on her. Also I will link down below a very good Vivi character analysis video by Ohara, be sure to check it out, its an amazing video and Ohara is an amazing One Piece YouTuber and is one of the best ones, along with King Recon, Rogersbase, Mr. Morj, Tekking101 and so on.

Brock from the Pokemon Anime - You can't mention ISFJ without Brock from Pokemon. He is probably one of the most ISFJ characters of all time. Brock is one of the best ISFJs ever in anime history. He remembers details strongly with his Si, cares a lot about his duty as a breeder and person and Pokemon trainer. He can compare and contrast all the Nurse Joys and Officer Jennies apart easily down to the last detail with his Si detailed memory and comparing and contrasting insane Si abilities with comparing them and telling them apart easily with no problems or issues at all. He's emotionally supportive with his Fe and is a very caring person. He reads people's emotions and can read a Pokemon's emotional state very easily and does it all the time which goes hand and hand with his doctor and nursing abilities as well along with his cooking abilities too that helps Pokemon feel better with his recipes and remedy medicine he often makes for Pokemon to make them feel better or special healing food he makes for them as well. An Fi user can also be a Doctor and care for others too with their Fi empathy like Chopper an INFP from One Piece who's also a doctor himself in that series, but in this case Brock is definitely a Fe user and focuses and cares for and feels the emotional state of other people and Pokemon all the time in the series with his Fe and he emotionally sympathizes with his Fe aux a lot with different people and Pokemon in the Pokemon series and franchise often all the time as well, Brock is without a doubt a Fe user in his case for sure no doubt. His Si is definitely dominant though as I stated with my Si dom examples above his amazing memory and the ability to remember and compare and contrast women he likes and loves apart and never forget them and what they look like in great detail with his massive Si dom behavior as an ISFJ. Brock gawks over women a lot with his Fe aux and he feels their emotions and is very polite and emotionally supportive to woman and he cares about society values with his Fe and loves to respect women and make them feel good with his Fe again and his constant Fe emotional supportiveness he showcases throughout the series of Pokemon. He's an extroverted introvert again for Brock just like Coby, Brock is ISFJ who are known for being extroverted introverts again because of Fe so it all makes sense he acts this way but is still a calm introvert as a personal overall. He hates taking risks and fears negative possibilities with his Ne inferior and he has a good grip also on his Ti tertiary and can notice small logical Ti inconsistencies with things and can piece together easily when a situation or battle Ash is having doesn't add up logical and he's always giving advice and sharing the truth on the answers for a situation and makes accurate analysis and judgments once he analyzes a situation logical in great detail with his Ti ter analyzing any situations he gets in along with his Si detail careful observation of course working together with his care Ti accuracy analysis of situations. What else can I say, its Brock. He's an OG ISFJ anime character, we all grew up with him a kids and children back in the day in the 90s when anime boomed then worldwide, we love him for it and all his contributions to Pokemon, his calm and level headed personality and caring nature too, his emotional supportiveness and tasty Pokemon food and regular food he made always looked good and made us hungry to eat ourselves while watching, I knew you guys were thinking the same thing while watched and loved and wanted to taste the good food he made in the show! Haha, but yeah its Brock you gotta love him and his awesome character, one of the best ISFJ characters and anime characters of all time. We'll never forget him and he always will be in our hearts in all time as Pokemon fans. Thanks for reading, onto the next character description to type and write out for you guys, I really enjoyed this one and loved writing about Brock as a clear ISFJ here. Here's a great ISFJ Brock post if you want to see more on why he's ISFJ for sure and one of the best ones ever of all time too.

Here's the Brock ISFJ post for him, I personally type Ash Ketchum ENFP and Misty ENFJ as well in my opinion if your interested and curious on my thoughts on them:

Momo Yaoyorozu - My Hero Academia, the new school anime in time everyone has their own unique opinons on haha. Well mine is that it's a really great series, its not perfect but still very great. But anyways moving onto Momo here, I actually admit I had trouble with her in the past. For years I thought she was ISTJ but people online convinced me she's actually ISFJ afterall and I can see it. She actually has a ISTJ image at first though, but maybe that's just the Si dom know it all and bringing up all the details they know and remember well stereotype with them as Si doms they often have and believing in rules and everyone should follow them part of her as well and her thinking he has the right to tell people what to do and how to run things and enforce the Si rules on them and expect them to follow them as well in her eyes. Despite this attitude she gives off at first hand, she's actually very sweet and caring when you get to know her, she's very emotionally supportive after all and I guess she actually uses Ti logical inconsistency analysis instead of hard efficiency Te logic actually. She cares for society values, this could be Si or Fe but it seems she cares about it as well with her Fe too not just the traditional Si values she believes in from the past she grew up with and was raised on. She's the perfect student and plays by the book with her Si rules and following them at all costs and expects everyone else in Class 1-A to follow them as well with both her Si and Fe. She definitely is a Ne inferior though with her fearing negative possibilities all the time and always hating risks and risk taking with treasuring her Si security in every situations she's in and wanting and expecting others to not be impulsive or jump in and to save safe security based Si plan and to think things through before taking some crazy risk and be prepared for everything that could go wrong, Ne inferior and Si dom behavior in her and the Si and Ne axis as a whole in her for sure coming out here in all these scenes and moments she's in as a ISFJ in the series as well. That's about it, there is more moments I'll probably talk about her character in future posts. I guess I can post to Tekking101s character analysis video for her down below, he hesitates a bit on when describing her introversion but don't worry Momo is definitely an introvert and is a calm and level headed girl and person personality wise for sure no doubt as ISFJ and Si dom definitely. And I agree also on how she's awkward at first and fails to see how she comes across at the beginning of the series again when he know it all detail oriented Si kicked in that start of the series to tell people the rules and what to do and what happened in the past with test in great detail and what they did right and wrong during the test they just had, she fixed this trait a bit later on and stopped trying to be a know it all girl all the time and became nicer and more inviting to people as the series progressed as I mentioned all above again:

Tekking101s Momo character analysis, and yes again she is a introvert Tekking. Momo is definitely introverted and is an introvert and in this case an ISFJ introvert as well more specifically:

I don‚Äôt tend to relate much to fictional characters. It‚Äôs not something that often crosses my mind. The ones I get attached to are usually ones I really admire. I typically find some traits relatable but hardly ever a character as a whole. 

As for ISFJ online typings, I typically feel quite disconnected from them but I also generally don‚Äôt relate to some traits people tend to heavily attach to ISFJ as being these dutiful and conscientious individuals who are model law abiding citizens (starting to believe enneagram plays a role in that).

So I'm taking a summer chemistry class with my friend (who is an ISFJ male) and he's really struggling. He has slow processing and ADD, so I understand that it takes him longer to do things. However, helping him becomes frustrating when it feels like he's not helping himself. He watches all the lectures between the hours of 1 AM‚Äì3 AM and wonders why he does so poorly on the quizzes at 9 AM. When lamenting to me about his poor quiz grades, I give him advice, none of which he has implemented. Meanwhile, I'm here watching the videos at a much earlier time, watching extra videos on YouTube, and doing review problems. Of course I'm doing better than him! It was alright at first, but the further along we have gotten in this class, the more confused he seems to have become. This has led to him asking me an excessive amount of questions to the point where I'm basically spoon-feeding him the answers. It's not hurting my grade since I've stopped helping him while doing my own work to make sure I hand mine in on time. He helps me out OCCASIONALLY by sending me a website that helped him or comparing answers after a quiz to see how well we did (not that it really helps me much).

The fact that he is willing to help me makes me feel so frustrated and more conflicted about how to handle this. It's just that his willingness to help isn't helpful at all since he doesn't actually understand the material. He's my friend and I want to help him, but I'm sick and tired of having to basically give him the answers on assignments! I just feel bad and frustrated and I'm not sure what to do.",1595536313

isfj,"Hello.. first time posting here.
I just wanted to ask anyone here that is an ISFJ or knows an ISFJ, I don't know if this is a healthy one or not.

How do you deal with someone using you?

I know an ISFJ that would complain to me about some ""friends"" that only talk to her to ask for help and it's things that aren't necessary or urgent, they just do it cause they know she will help and then they poof and show up again when they need something.

But she doesn't confront them even when she knows they are using her, and sometimes when they are in distress she offers to help them when she knows they wouldn't even ask how she is doing. She tries to distance herself from some at some point but still helps whenever they ask which I find ridiculous ( Why invest in those people?) 

If you bend to people that don't care about you isn't that being naive instead of good?
Can you guys give me some perspective to understand why ISFJ (or if it's not an ISFJ thing) acts this way when they know they are being used and for a long time (years)?

I want to understand ISFJ's perspective better, any information is appreciated. Thanks!",1595441712

I wasn't even intentionally looking for answers here, but you made me realise I apparently mistyped him as ISTP. Reading all these posts answered so many questions, you can't even imagine.

isfj,"So here's the deal:

I typed INFJ and INFP for a very long time, but when I started actually learning about cognitive functions and started asking others about their perception of my behavior it sounds like SI/FE is a better fit. 

However, it seems like people's concept of what ISFJs are is SUPER rigid. Like, you are either a soft-spoken mom who hates anything exciting or nothing rigid. There's also a default assumption that they fit into society at large well and like mainstream everything. 

Anyone else out there feel like they do not fit that at all? Like, they've struggled with feeling like they don't fit in? Have hobbies or interested that make them a bit outside of the norm?",1595356223

I recently found r/MbtiTypeMe and decided to post some of my Crystalknows results to see what others would gather from it for laughs. Someone commented that my dislike for outside distractions sounded a lot like Ni, but I thought this was weird. On one hand, yeah, that does sound like something a Ni dom would hate because of extroverted Sensing being in a lower position, but on the other hand, that doesn't immediately rule out the possibility that Si dominants can also easily get sensory overload, does it?

There is not a whole lot of information that I could find online that supports this theory, but I've found plenty of fellow ISFJs on this subreddit that are also easily overstimulated because we process all of the information we take in.

I'll try to keep things short.  There's a really cute girl that works in a Mcdonalds near me.  I'm there almost every day to get my coffee (as we ISFJ's can't function without it.)  For the last couple of weeks, I've noticed that she holds her stare longer with me than with other customers.  From my past observations (I don't stalk her lol.  I do my observing whilst I wait for my order) I've noticed that she tends to hold longer eye contact with me when she gives me my order.  She's maintained eye contact while walking backwards away from me; she has also bumped into her co-workers as a result.  What should I do?  Is she just doing her job or is she interested in me?",1595285563
isfj,"I kind of need some advice here. I suppose I'm an anomaly amongst INTPs, but there is this ISFJ that I felt really attached to who was in my class extracurricular class for a year. I feel like ISFJs that are willing to engage in mental sparring, are fine with being roasted, and tend to be ok with constant complaining are pretty rare. I think she also really enjoyed my company as a friend, but I'm not entirely sure of her potential for other feelings.

Unfortunately, we aren't really in close proximity (in terms of location, of course).

Nevertheless, I figured trying wouldn't hurt. I tried hint to her that I liked her at first by basically talking to her every chance I got (which, to be honest, was not often because she didn't tend to check her social media a lot). Now, this is a pretty high honor from an INTP, but considering her ISFJ personality, I bet the idea didn't come across. So after a few months, I figured confessing would probably be the best way to go.

Right off the bat, though, she said that she was really worried about the fact that we didn't really have a lot of opportunities to meet. She also talked about how she was really swamped right now, but how she really wanted to take into account my feelings. She also kept saying that ""I'm not rejecting you"". She said that she was willing to meet up with me a few months later to see how things worked between us.

Give or take two months, and we go on a date (? she called it ""hanging out?""). Apparently, she had somewhere to go later (and this was legit) and so could only hang out for a little while.

So then we eat for a bit, and at the end, I asked her if she wanted to continue this thing. Unfortunately, she said that she doesn't feel ready, and that she doesn't think a long distance relationship would work out. She then emphasized about how I was a really great friend, and how she appreciated my courage + honesty.

This really begs the question: should I keep trying to pursue her? I mean, the people that qualify as my friends are far and few in between already, so... I don't know. But there's a definite possibility that I might be able to fix the long distance problem, so if it sounds like she doesn't have a fundamental issue with me, I might decide to continue working at it.

Really then, the main question is: are her words just ISFJ buffer or is she telling the truth?",1595284693

isfj,"I‚Äôve been thinking about a concept and I‚Äôm wondering others‚Äô perspectives on it. Is there such thing as a ‚Äúrighteous‚Äù or ‚Äújust‚Äù love? Of course, love can be selfless and/or selfish if taken to extremes, but is there such thing as a love that is moral? Maybe it‚Äôs my black and white thinking, but I struggle to think of ways love can be neither selfish nor selfless. Is the very act of falling in love selfish in a way? Of course, selfishness in a way is not inherently ‚Äúwrong,‚Äù likewise selflessness is not inherently ‚Äúright.‚Äù 

The reason I bring this up is because it‚Äôs been a year and some after falling out with my ex. I‚Äôve been contemplating for a year how I truly feel about her. Do I love her? If so, is it true love? I was not mentally or emotionally well during our time together and I hurt her. I did not care for myself, I hated myself and it manifested towards her. I think back and see my flaws and errors and I‚Äôm ashamed. I‚Äôm actively taking steps to correct those issues of mine. Is that love? Also, during our relationship, I was jealous of her accomplishments. I think back and feel so awful about that. I wish I could tell her how proud of her I am, even though she doesn‚Äôt need my validation. Is that love? 

Going forward, I really desire to try again. Still I ask myself, ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù Why can‚Äôt I stop thinking about her? Why do I feel a desire to learn more of her and how I can improve as a person, as a man? Is it wrong, am I selfish? Or is it right and I‚Äôm selfless? It‚Äôs just been on my mind everyday for as long as we‚Äôve been apart. In my own imperfect reasoning and introspection, I do believe I‚Äôm truly in love with her. Looking forward, I do see how I can leave the past in the past and strive forward. I can see potential ways to better go about difficult matters and I especially desire to walk together as equals. Though I do have to wonder, am I deluding myself? Am I doing more bad than good? Is my love, no matter how well-intentioned, harmful? I know that only she and I could say and there‚Äôs only so much internet strangers can tell me, but I just don‚Äôt want to feel lost. 

Anyways, if any of my fellow ISFJs have any success stories (preferably with NPs as my ex is), I‚Äôd love to read them. I‚Äôd love to have a little pick-me-up and faith restoration.

isfj,"Good Day fellow ISFJs and snoopers =), 

I just watched Ghibli's movie Howl's Moving Castle and was immediately captured by how beautiful, and deeply meaningful the movie was. Very briefly, the protagonist, Sophie, is an ISFJ and her story represents the closest thing I have seen to the [Hero myth archetype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%27s_journey) \-ISFJ edition.

So, I highly recommend this movie to you other ISFJs for 2 reasons. 

First, you are going to enjoy it because of the how beautiful Ghibli movies are, biased opinion here lol, and more importantly, how familiar you will find everything about the protagonist and her journey; it is hard to find shows and movies with an ISFJ protagonists &gt;&lt;. 

Secondly, this movie can provide you with the motivation and ways to step out of your orderly ISFJ life into the unknown, confront and befriend your Ne function, then utilize it to help you make order out of chaos.

Here are some of my notes about the movie.

The storyline:

&gt;!The beginning of the movie resembles the wakeup call which Sophie goes through. That if she does not stand up for herself and what she wants, like her rather social and independent younger sister or her mother who is enjoying her life, that she is going to age and turn into an old lady without experiencing any of the joys of life. This is apparent by how, in the beginning, she does to not care for her looks, is convinced that she is ugly, wouldn't go out to social events, does not know anyone in her town, and would sacrifice her life for others; work in her father's shop. !&lt;

&gt;!Then when she finds out that the bad forces of life will visit her, even if she is sheltered in her own house, she steps out full of determination but also feeling like an old lady, and scared of what could be. Then, as she progresses, she stays true to her character, helps the scarecrow, befriends the fire, cooks for the young kid, care after the lady who casted the spell on her, and cleans the messy house. She starts to feel more confident as she sees that what she was afraid of is not as scary as she used to think it was, and you can see that in how her visible age fluctuates throughout the movie.!&lt;

&gt;!She finally finds the injured bird which has been waiting for her all this time, and cures him. But only after she is ready to let her new house which has just been renovated to get destroyed, then even more, she has to step into the unknown, past the black door into the void. In the scariest of all places lies the answer to how she can save her love, Howl. !&lt;

My main take from the movie is here:

The call to step into the unknown is repeated throughout the movie, but is most emphasized in the last scene, and that is what the main message to take from this movie. We like to stay in our neatly ordered homes, help others around us and even put their needs before us. But if we do not face the world with its good and bad, at least the bad side will definitely come to visit us. 

This does not mean that we have to completely abandon the way we behave. An example of a good ISFJ attitude is how she takes care of everyone she meets including those who caused her misery. In a way, she knows that it is not life's fault that we will grow old, get sick, and go through all the negative experiences. As a result, we should not get mad at the world, and rather do our best to care for those less fortunate and in that that is the true redemption.

Of course, most of this can be said about other types and be true to them to varying degrees, but it was just a shock to me to see it in this movie because of how everything I saw about the protagonist I could see in myself.

I would love to hear your opinions about the movie if you've watched it, and your recommendations if you know of other ISFJiy movies :\]",1594955364
isfj,"I introspected and looked inside of myself and discovered how I cogitate.

isfj,"If Fe goes undeveloped and leaves SiTi to handle the majority of cognition, the ISFJ is prone to feelings of terror that his trusted support network will fall out from under him at any given moment. Trusting others to handle important tasks becomes an uneasy endeavor at best. 


Since the feeling of trust and security upon which Si depends so heavily is never connected in any meaningful way to the bonds and relationships defined by interaction with others, the SiTi loop ISFJ feels that no one but himself can ever be depended upon to bring him the sort of consistently reliable experience his dominant function necessitates that he have access to. 


Without a way to describe or objectively designate his feelings for others or theirs for him, no sense of faith in upholding mutual responsibilities can form--he must do everything for himself, or risk total ruination through the failure of other less reliable individuals to uphold their agreements and obligations. 


If you want something done right, you have to do it yourself--or risk facing the unknown, totally unprepared--which, of course, represents Si's worst fear of all.


This is an excerpt from the section on the auxilary function from this website: https://www.typologycentral.com/wiki/index.php/ISFJ


How do you relate? Here is an essay on my personal take, aha.


 I relate to this so. hard. I shared it with my ENFJ bestfriend, and he said ""That hit so hard *I* felt it.""  And that helped confirm that it's true for me.


I never really thought of myself as standoffish or closed off until I met my current friend group, and they got close enough to me to be able to comfortably tell me that I seemed like I had a huge wall up when they first met me, and it took a lot of steady prying to get me to come out of my shell and share what I was thinking with them.


However, even with as close as I've gotten to them, I've recently been in a bit of a spiral? Mental health issues because I am overworked and stressed? Where it becomes very hard to rely on them for help, because I feel like I have to do everything myself.
I isolate myself, and pretend like everything is fine, but then I get paranoid, and negative thoughts start filling my mind, and I start thinking they might want to get rid of me, that I'm not good enough, that I can't put in enough effort for them, I see things as give and take, and if I take even one small thing I have to give back double or more, and if I can't give back the double or more I should just deal with it myself and not to take.


I've had to take the reins in my life and marriage, both financially, socially, etc for the past 5 years because my husband has dealt with crippling depression. I've dealt with everything by myself for so long that it's very hard to come out of  that hole and Trust others to get things done or help to my own level of satisfaction. 


I'm terrified I will lean on someone for support only for that support beam to be jerked out from underneath me.

but lately, specifically with the idea of a female significant other, I find that I'm very attracted to those quite different from me...

It all started when I went to the bank recently and this woman around my age was working there and she helped explain a lot of finance related stuff to me, because I know hardly anything about all that..

It was just so attractive that she was more straight-forward, grounded, rooted more in thinking over feelings,
and just her knowing more about something I don't was super attractive...

And just really anytime I call this investing company where women usually answer, it's always so pleasant and attractive talking with someone who is quite different from me...

And then recently watching this suspense detective thriller, and one of the leads was this 30-something women who was just so grounded, analytical and a true thinker, but had this underlying sweetness ans gentleness which is incredibly attractive.
 
Probably something like a healthy ISFJ or even ISTJ.

My dad is a very unhealthy abusive ISTJ and most men I've encountered in my life are, so it drove me away from
anyone different from me, especially with romantic relationships with women,

but now I'm becoming much more attracted to thinking-based women who are pragmatic and more analytical then I am... I always thought all ISTJ's were insensitive and emotionally abusive.

But the healthy ISTJ's and ISFJ's are not insensitive or closed off from their feelings, which I learned recently.

It's extremely attractive to me, and I think being with a women who is like this is much better than being with someone who's so much like me.

In a romantic relationship, I think it creates a well balanced whole... and I can learn about different perspectives from a thinking-based analytical person, and she can learn more about feelings-based perspectives etc,

and all our fun hobbies rooted in our thinking minds and feelings- based hearts!

And two healthy individuals, where I personally am not without logic and analyzing, and she is not without feelings or sensitivity sounds amazing!",1594586682
isfj,"I‚Äôve had a hard time learning new things. Concepts often seem to go over my head and I rarely ever recall what I thought I learnt. Over time, I realized that it was because I never truly understood what I was learning.

The Feynman technique is particularly effective at helping you master difficult concepts. Named after the Nobel Prize winning Richard Feynman, the concept focuses on explaining a difficult concept in easy to understand language as if you were explaining it to someone else (or a child). By following the Feynman technique, you might just end up learning difficult concepts quickly, spend less time studying, and remember concepts longer.

The four steps are as follows:

1. Write the concept down
2. Explain it using simple language
3. Address (look up) problematic areas or questions that remain
4. Challenge yourself to simplify it further

I have found this to be a powerful concept that helps you cut study time shortly. The push to understand and explain a concept forces you to identify areas where you have a gap in your understanding. I‚Äôve broken this down even further here - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RleSyp16lLE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RleSyp16lLE).

Unfortunately, one of my hs friends ( she was tested as enfp but hey no hate to enfps this is all anecdotal) would only chat me up whenever I WOULD be the first one to initiate a convo. If i dont initiate a convo she just dips. She also comments but she never initiates a conversation like hey how are you unless it's me asking first how her life went.

I dont want to confront her because the last time i asked her about the boy she used to like and made comment about that boy not to be trusted based on the info she gave me ( i just wanted her to be careful), she somehow accused me of being judgemental.

Im thinking of cutting ties with her because i have other friends who give back but hey thats the recipe for evey relationship.

isfj,"Hi , I'm sorry if there's any grammar mistakes because I'm not a native English speaker.

I'm a 17 year old male , I got interested in MBTI about 8 months ago because I wanted to understand myself more.

I took the 16personalities test and other mbti tests including the cognitive functions tests twice , The results from most of them were always ISFJ or ISTJ.

But unfortunately the descriptions for both types don't really describe me so I read a lot about the other types and the cognitive functions to find my type but I failed so I hope someome helps me to find it.

Here's some information about me :
 1- I enjoy talking to the people I like , I'm also okay with meeting new people if it's one or two because more than that makes me feel uncomfortable and unfocused.

2- If I like someone I will try to make them laugh and I will try to find what do they like to do or talk about so I could learn more about it to get closer to them.

3- If someone is rude to other people I instantly dislike them , I stand up for the people I care about and I never forgive anyone who hurts them.

4- I get a bad feeling about some people because I feel like they aren't good people even though they act nice.

5- I enjoy organizing and cleaning my things , I get rid of things that are useless to me , I hate staying in unorganised or dirty places.

6- But at the same time I dislike schedules , to do lists and deadlines , I also procrastinate a lot by playing games or watching videos when I should study or do something that's boring to me.

7- People say I'm polite and nice even though I don't smile a lot or make eye contact enough but I make sure I don't offend or hurt anyone's feelings when talking to them.

8- I started trying new things like going to new places or playing new types of video games so I could improve myself instead of always doing what I already know.

9- I like imagining myself in stories I read or watch and imagining how I would communicate with the characters and how I would react to the events in these stories.

10- I hate pretending or faking just to fit in with others because it makes me very uncomfortable and unhappy so the only thing I can fake about myself is smiling.

11- I don't like social situations like parties or family meetings because I don't like talking too much or being around a lot of people.

12- I don't consider anyone my friend easily even though a lot of people call me ""friend"" after 1 or 2 months of meeting me , I don't have a lot of friends too and I even get the feeling that my friends dislike me sometimes.

13- I don't use or care about social media or online games if there isn't anyone I want to talk to there or play with , I enjoy games with good stories , design and atmosphere.

14- I care about details in things that I create or do , Like having everything organized and clean in my room or writing things without mistakes , I have a fear of failing to do something.

I hope I didn't write too much , If there's any questions then please write them in the comments and I will answer honestly.

Thanks for reading.",1593772222

isfj,"* So basically I told him about the MBTI before I learned about Dominant Functions. He took the 16personalities test and got INFJ. This kinda shocked us because he thought he was more extroverted and thinking, I was shocked because it was very different from my expectations. I asked him to take it again. He got ISFJ this time. I thought it fit him more, but we were still shocked.
   * I know 16p is not very accurate, but in my opinion, I think it gives a good startup for figuring out your cognitive functions later on. The first thing I got taking the 16p test, is one letter away from my actual MBTI.
* So I heard that ISFJs are the ""ambiverts"" of the Introvert community, well, he is an ambivert. He is both shy and outgoing, and it's not common to be both. In a social situation, he likes to talk a lot. He likes to go to parties. But when it comes to meeting new people he can be shy. He can also be shy when he is asked an ""iffy"" question, like in a personal sense. Sometimes when his friends are over he will either talk and interact with them a lot or he'll sit quietly and read a book.
* That brings me to the next point. He's a very smart guy. He reads a lot of books and watches documentaries for fun. He is kind of a nerd in this way. He gets really good grades at school, and I think he is the smartest guy in his class. He even **skipped** a grade when he was younger because he knew everything. I'm not sure how much this correlates to MBTI but it might help.
* He is also a sweetheart. You can tell that he loves his friends and cares for them. If someone is feeling sad, then he won't stop helping them until he's 100% sure that they're ok. He is also selfless and doesn't care about his own self as much as he cares about other people. He puts other's problems before his own and helps people with a smile. He doesn't like to hurt other people. He likes to defend those who he loves the most. He gets mad when someone makes rude remarks to him or his loved ones. He loves to make people happy and I really like that about him.
* These two quantities of his intellect and his kindness make him a really good leader. He has a really big heart combined with his intelligence are what makes him a leader of his class. He also likes to follow the rules, which adds to his leader point. His kindness allows his friends and classmates to open up to him about problems. He is a very good listener and helper that helps solves these problems really well. He also helps to tutor his classmates on subjects. He does a really good job, but if he has to do work for them instead of helping them, that causes him to overwork himself, then he has to say no, because he knows it's too much on his plate. 
* He also helps resolve conflicts in this way. If there is an argument/fight between his friends or classmates, he will do his very best to try to break up the fight. He hates to see fights go on. He also puts the rules before himself. One day, he was on my discord server when a toxic person said a really rude remark. He got angry at them, and then someone deleted the messages. I asked him what's wrong and who did it and he told me that it's ok and I shouldn't worry, it was just a joke. It's a joke so it's ok, because that's what the rules said, was what he said. I asked his friends instead. They told me who the person was and I basically told them off. 
* He thinks the head and the heart are both very important in decision making and thinks I should follow my heart more. He is very logical, and I think ISFJs are one of the most logical feeling types. Again, because of his intellect, he can make very good decisions. He is very wise. He likes to see the consequences of his decisions before he takes them. He doesn't like to take risks. He also doesn't want to hurt people. Overall, I think he is very rational and can make very effective choices.
* If you ask him what he wants to be when he grows up, he wouldn't know. He is very indecisive about his future, even though I think he's capable of anything. He is indecisive between a career that he would enjoy (that would benefit himself and he'd have fun) or a career that involves helping others.

I did some research on ISFJ and it seems to fit him well. But the problem is, I'm not an ISFJ, so I want to see what you guys think.

isfj,"Disclaimer: I wrote this post because I hardcore relate to Burr, I think he's a great example of an ISFJ who isn't the selfless/caring stereotype. But I also realise that he's *written* to be relatable - he's the narrator, a sympathetic villain, etc. so I'm open to other typings and if you have any in mind, let's discuss it! Also there are **spoilers for Hamilton**, as much as the life of someone who lived 200+ years ago can be spoiled lol

Here's my reasoning:

**Burr's Si and Fe conflicts with Hamilton's (probably) Ne and Fi**

Hamilton's argument against Burr throughout the entire musical is that he is inauthentic, he never goes after what he wants and never says what he feels. The strongest expression of this is after Burr's bid for President, though it's present in the dynamic between the two for a long time.

&gt;\[Hamilton\] Jefferson has beliefs. Burr has none.

Not 'having beliefs' isn't necessarily indicative of Fe- Burr could just be a self-serving politician who doesn't let his own values mix with his politics. We can look at earlier songs to see if this is the case.

*Wait for It* happens when the tension between Hamilton and Burr is just beginning to build up. Hamilton has been running his mouth, expressing his every opinion openly, acting impulsively, etc. (in Burr's view) but he is *successful* and catches Washington's eye. Burr has to start reconciling with Hamilton's way of feeling passionately and pursuing aggressively.

In Burr's response, he goes through all the relationships and experiences that are meaningful to him and then concludes:

&gt;I am inimitable  
&gt;  
&gt;I am an original  
&gt;  
&gt;I'm not falling behind or running late  
&gt;  
&gt;I'm not standing still, I am lying in wait

It's not just that Burr has strong opinions that he keeps to himself because of political expediency. (Though expediency is why he attacks Hamilton for sharing *his* opinions). He doesn't even *get* what Hamilton means by inauthenticity. His argument in *Wait for It* is essentially: ""I have all these deeply personal experiences that nobody else has. I've been shaped by them and they have made me 100% original, truly me. What do you *mean* I'm inauthentic?"" which is *such* a Si dom thing to say and also reveals a low understanding of Fi.

I can't think of an instance where Burr made a Fi-like value judgement about anything. Yes, he calls Hamilton prideful (""your pride will be the death of us all"") but Fi users castigate others for pridefulness because it's morally wrong. What *Burr* doesn't like is Hamilton's audacity in thinking he can do whatever he wants, which reads more like Si discomfort with Ne. Burr's anger is reactionary, not based in a value system. What makes him truly mad is when Hamilton calls him out in front of a bunch of people ""just to keep \[him\] from winning"". This reads like a (very egotistical) Fe user.

We also see the conflict between inferior Ne and higher Ne. Like most Si doms, Burr actually craves and seeks change. He wants to rise up in the ranks, become Washington's assistant, etc. Later in the musical, he capitalises on the opportunity to run for office against Hamilton's father-in-law. But he just doesn't get using Ne as a primary way to do things, which is the tension in the following lines:

&gt;And if there's a reason  
&gt;  
&gt;He seems to thrive when so few survive  
&gt;  
&gt;Then Goddamnit I'm willing to wait for it.

In other words: this guy comes in and impulsively tries to change the whole system, and Burr *doesn't understand it*. His own way of doing things, his understanding of how the world works - it's served him well all along, and now Hamilton is seemingly dismantling it and succeeding. In the end he's like f that, I trust my own experience, I'm willing to wait for it to show me what the secret behind his success is.

I've seen him typed as INTJ a bit, but I'm seeing a lot of familiar Si dom patterns of thinking. What do you think?",1593662312

But more speed equals more quick decisions on the fly, and it's just so satisfying I can't help myself. Staying indoors for a couple of days working or just chilling out and reading books results in this 'walls caving in'-thing, and there is this strong urge to move again.

She mostly fits the mould of an ISFJ but weirdly we struggle a lot with the balance of ‚Äúgiver‚Äù and ‚Äútaker‚Äù. She is CONSTANTLY asking me to do things for her (can you refill my water? Can we go do X activity this weekend? Can you write a resume cover letter for me? Etc.). And conversely when I ask her for things (which I don‚Äôt do as often) she won‚Äôt do them at all or will do them in a way where I don‚Äôt feel like she really cares. Even for things that I have stressed are really important to me. Sometimes she will do the exact opposite of what I ask just to try and get a rise out of me. 

She insists she‚Äôs a true ISFJ and has taken tests over the years. Deep down I know she cares and she does do a lot to help me, but it‚Äôs always on her terms. Sometimes the ‚Äúhelp‚Äù isn‚Äôt very helpful like when she stands over my shoulder on the computer and tells me what I should have written in an email, that sort of thing. 

What am I doing wrong?? How do I unlock more of her selfless giver side to bring our relationship more into balance? How can I get her to be more responsive to what I actually need vs what she thinks I need? Thanks for your thoughts and advice!",1593165435
isfj,"My INTJ friend and I (ISFJ) used to go to the same university together in my hometown, that's where we met for the first time. I could say that I befriended him first since he didn't know anyone and seemed shy. Truth be told, I was also kind of attracted to him, as well. We attended absolutely all the same classes, sometimes we'd spend more time together because of this than with my then SO. He was single, but I wasn't and he knew. Although he was quieter and more reserved, we got along really well and I started to develop feelings for him over time. I never shared this with him since it wasn't fair and I didn't want to ruin our friendship, but still, in subtle ways, we made it clear between each other that I'm not thinking about ""switching over"" to someone else, and his taste in women, lookwise at least, is extremely peculiar (I really didn't seem fit that type).

A few years have passed since then, our ways have parted (however, we're still great friends), we've matured, and with maturing I look back at myself with somewhat shame. I've never been the hot chick, I've always been the witty, kind of a cute tomboy, but I've always been protective, a bit clingy with my closest male (and female) friends and somewhat courteous (with kind gestures, helping them, or walking them to the bus stop where we parted for the day). I feel as if there were specific moments back then when I was aching to break our friendship without thinking about the consequences, but luckily, I held my instincts back. He had another, a few years older close female friend (who I actually worked with) to whom I'm pretty sure he shared more stuff with than with me. One day all 3 of us were out and they told me that he found someone he really likes. He chose to share this with her first, instead of me, which seemed to be a bit suspicious, I guess. Stupid me, I couldn't hide that both of these things hurt me and I instantly became distant and quiet right in front of them. I was young and selfish, thinking that this platonic thing can go on for a long time, but it ended right there and then. At the end of that day, I cried myself to her friend, told her about my feelings, and I assume that she might have told him without me knowing about it, but I have no way of knowing this.

Is there any reason for me to be honest to him about this, that I feel like I should have acted less of a ""platonic girlfriend"" who couldn't choose him anyway? To be really honest, I don't think there is since we're in good terms despite that weird incident (which he probably forgot since then) and I feel like I'm walking on eggshells when it comes to any emotional topic with his type of personality - so, I think I already have my answer... I know you detest these kinds of mushy sentimental topics but I need a more objective and logical viewpoint to this. Sorry if it seems like I'm rambling :(.",1593124697

I've never done this before, and finding a carrier to do so is causing me stress. Apparently its not a cut and dry process. You give a pickup date and delivery location to a shipping company, they find a driver &amp; deliver it. But right now, covid 19 has driver availability lower and business slower than usual, and ever-fluctuating market rates make prices go up after initial quotes.

I've been lookin online... (here on reddit mostly) to read about other people's experiences shipping cars and someone posted a recent but very bad experience of the company that I had made the decision to place an order with today. They followed up to say they found another company last minute and had no problems. I called the second company and the representative was constantly cutting me off when I was asking questions about their process, and this also made me uneasy. I felt like he was just ready for me to make the order and take my money, only to leave me in the wind, giving vague updates along the way, like so many people have said happened to them.

At the moment I just need to calm myself down. Therapy has helped me be able to step back and assess when I begin to panic and trace back where the feeling came from and whether or not its a logical or emotional response, but I haven't tapped into stopping the actual panic and anxiety. It's frustrating me to the point where I am in tears. My lease is up next month so I need to figure this out but I don't want to get scammed and everywhere I look I am given a reason not to trust it.

Webster's Dictionary defines Selfless as ""Having no concern for self"" 

The old saying, ""I would take a bullet for ____"" ...would you? Really?


Being an ISFJ is very troublesome in some instances. 
As a childless woman, its hard for me to think this way, and since I had such a strange upbringing I have only 1 person outside of my husband that I would honestly call a friend, and honestly she and I are related. 

My husband however... I cannot ever imagine loving anything stronger, harder, more deeply... I would imagine that if it came to ""taking a bullet"" I would because I honestly could not live without him. 

I also think back to a few past relationships or friendships. No matter how dirty they did me, I am still concerned for their well-being. I wouldn't ""take the bullet,"" but I would likely feel sorrow, and likely feel guilty for not taking it.

Long story short, I took Jung's typology test around 7 or 8 years ago. I'm not entirely sure, but I might have taken the test [on this website](http://www.humanmetrics.com/cgi-win/jtypes2.asp) since I remember it looking outdated. After I got my result, I even typed my grandmother - turned out we had the same type (just a wholesome fact).

*Anyway*, a few years have passed, I took the test about 3 more times since then (because self-doubt, I guess?) -  yaddy yadda yadda (saving you time) - and I realized that I feel most ""home"" typed as an ISFJ, as I was ""originally"" typed.

I really love this subreddit compared to a few others that I followed for quite a while, and I definitely relate deeply to your posts. Of course, this doesn't mean that I'm going to go right ahead and blame my behavior/decisions on it or find excuses because of it - but besides wanting to understand myself better, it's amazing to know that there are other people like us together on a forum where we can discuss things, where we can closely relate to each other and even help each other out if needed.

End scene.

 We used to be good colleagues/friends at work for a couple of months and can talk about lots of different things outside work. I fell for her after a while and casually asked if she wanted to hang out for coffee two maybe three times and was always given ""introversion"" as a reason for refusing. I felt being treated unfairly and started distancing myself from her and at the same time giving her space to recharge and have her own time. As time pass I confessed my feelings to her and apologised for my behaviour, she politely thanked me and refused vaguely. (While still wanting to be friends?) While Im okay with this since we used to be able to interact really nicely, however now she is completely avoiding me, ignoring texts, avoiding me at work, or being very awkward during our interactions, while able to have even longer deep conversations with our other colleagues.

most of what fits me as an isfj (not talking about cognitive functions cause I still don't understand all of them) is that I'm too good at remembering everything from everyone (things nobody would care enough to do so), I'm an empathy, I don't really like to talk about my feelings with people, I'm really family attached and I crave for long term relationships (I have the same bffs since I was 12) I have a big sense of right and wrong based on my feelings and my past experiences and values.

I'm not the selfless butterfly everyone pictures isfj. I actually know how to say no to things, I don't to good everytime for the sake of everyone cause I know it's not possible (I have a voice that screams ""ME"" in the back of my head and I listen to it).

So ISFJs of reddit what is your type of humour so that we can joke together without it ending in arguments where she feels as though her or others are being attacked?

(4:40) - starts his response.

His answer for those of you who don‚Äôt want to listen.

...you initiate first and give them what they want which is ‚Äúa want to be desired.‚Äù This ‚Äúwant to be desire‚Äù comes in the form of choosing them; meaning they want to feel that they were chosen above everyone else.  You must also provide comfort and be kind. ISFJ loves it when you‚Äôre nice to them and nice to other people; behave in a principle manner. Gift giving seems to be high on the love language for ISFJ ‚Äî not necessarily the gift itself, but if you were to go and buy something unique to the ISFJ (ie. a certain coffee from a certain coffee shop, food, etc). This implies that you did some research. Other good gifts idea are gifts that ease their burden; ISFJ tend to carry people‚Äôs burden and obligations so if you could ease that, it‚Äôll really help in your favor. A sense of humor is probably the number one factor in attracting an ISFJ. The ideal relationship type for ISFJ is ESFP. Rapport is something that is important to the ISFJ. The gift of food goes a long way; their favorite food makes them comfortable. The last important thing is to listen to them, regardless if you disagree or think they don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre talking about. If you spend the time to listen, and considerate it, maybe even experiment with what they‚Äôre saying to see the truth or false...it shows that you‚Äôre not overlooking the ISFJ. Listening to them makes them feel wanted and intelligent.",1592111676

isfj,"Hi all, so I (ENFP 31) met a guy (ISFJ 29) on a dating app. Started with him liking me more, we met 5 times and talked daily for 2 months and I grew in respect and attraction for him. But we kissed and I freaked out because I thought I passed Lyme Disease to him, passed him some meds and immune booster and his symptoms disappeared. (He lied about taking the meds and only took the immune booster specific to Lyme disease.)


On our last date he said his attraction for me was fluctuating when I sensed smth was off and asked more deeply. And that he said we could go out more after this whole covid19 thing ends and see if attraction could be nurtured. I freaked out and said it wouldn't work because it's not sustainable if the guy is less attracted whereas for a woman attract for a man can build up. He ghosted me for a weekend and expected me to be angry but I was understanding. Felt bad that I was understanding. (Almost like he wanted me to be angry and dump him?)

SORRY FOR THE LONG ASS POST just wanted to add as many details as possible if it helps you evaluate:

- He wants to be friends and just call me when he feels like it.
- He was quite upset during our big conversation and said ""sorry but you can start talking to other guys"". I was so crushed :(
- He asked if it's better if he said he didn't like me at all and that we won't have a chance, or that he still liked me a little. I asked him to be honest. And he said the most 'suitable' answer is probably he still likes me but the attraction is fluctuating. Was he pressured to answer that since I kept pressing him? -___-
- When he replies texts he remembers events or things I've mentioned and wishes me luck, or he'd see my instagram story and text ""hope you're enjoying myself"".
- I initiated most of our calls. He initiated once. I stopped texting and calling and it's been 3 days of zero texts and calls from him.
- He said his attraction for me was strongest on our first date. Strong on our FaceTime calls. After the health scare he said attraction dropped and didn't know why. Not that I wasn't physically attractive, or had a good personality, the 'vibe' changed.
- He said he felt he 'should' give me a wake up call like when he was courting me, and that he would think if i was ok and missed my calls to him in the first week after our big conversation. I don't know if it's pity that he's wondering if I'm ok health wise and not real love and attraction.
- He's stopped all terms of endearment. But he is comfortable and joking/teasing with me in calls.
- He had anxiety about whether he caught Lyme from me.
- We joke about sexual things sometimes. Not sure if that's a good sign. He said sexual tension and attraction/connection was different. And that his exes were never open about talking about sex.
- I post workout pics on instagram stories and there was once I asked him and he said he found one too revealing. Is that a minus point?
- I asked if I'm a friend, he said yes. I might have just friendzoned myself. *sad* When I looked sad he asked why and I said 'nothing' though it's written all over my face lol.
- I asked why he stopped replying my texts, he said he doesn't text much and would just call me. Hasn't called.
- Calls his guy best friend and female best friend about once a week. His ex girlfriend calls him as well.
- Is an auditor and is busy working from home and on site so I'm trying to account for that.
- In his past relationships, he had two gfs where he was the pursuer, the girl wasn't as clear about her feelings, but they built over 3 months to the point of sleeping together and that's when they made things official. He had one gf where she liked him more than he liked her, she broke up because she sensed that he was slowly neglecting her. He said he would have stuck with her if she hadn't broken up. He's said he doesn't want us to end up like that. Because I've mentioned it's sad that she liked him more. He did make the distinction that he never felt intense feelings for her like he did with me once.
- Has mentioned that if I was working in an office he would be too intimidated to approach me (RBF? My beauty? Above his league?) but because I'm quirky he feels comfortable with me.
- He said that no matter what, he wants me in his life because I'm unique (even if I threw 1000 stones outside they won't hit someone like you).
- He said he didn't mind my low income as a freelancer.
- He said he didn't mind my Lyme disease. (Don't know how true that is given ISFJs are so considerate about ppl's feelings)
- He said he didn't mind delaying sex until I cure my Lyme disease and not pass it to him.
- He talked to a friend and said that he might have rushed into things because he feels like he's at an age where his friends are settling down. His friend advised him to go out with more girls.
- He told me he's deleted his apps though and if it doesn't happen it's ok. I asked if he was doing that to be nice to me and he said he didn't know and looked uncomfortable.
- I shared with him that some ISFJs here posted that their attraction for a woman dropped when she declared her feelings maybe because the chase is over. He chuckled as it never occurred to him. Just gave me the impression he's not very aware of his feelings or why his feelings changed.
- He wanted to marry his ex gf after 3 years but she dumped him. He's over her and she asked to be with him again but he rejected that. She still calls him a lot though even though she's in a relationship now because ""he's the person who knows her best"".
- He's said that he wants his next relationship to end in marriage. That's my attitude as well to every rs I've been in.
- I told him after our kiss that I wasn't physically attracted to him somehow although I very much liked him as a person. He was pretty calm about it and said fluctuating feelings happen sometimes and we could see how it goes. Now that his feelings are fluctuating it seems that things have cooled off a lot.
- He asked me what I was looking for and I said someone who is patient and understanding as my Lyme Disease is unpredictable, able to give emotional support, he started out saying he's the type to stick through thick and thin but now....

I'm at a point where I'm sad that things degraded so quickly. If I hadn't been so anxious about him getting Lyme and spooked him we might have progressed steadily. I feel tired of initiating most of the time, though I'm happy he responds well when I tell him sweet sincere things like ""I'm glad I managed to talk to you for a bit."" and he makes an effort to text the next day, he would say ""I enjoy having someone there when I work even though it's slightly distracting"" and I make an effort to surprise FaceTime him. I share good news with him when I've got a gig and he's encouraging to me.


This experiment where I stop texting calling him for three days is not turning out well. He isn't texting or calling me and it's the weekend.


Much as I like him, it really hurts if he isn't that attracted to me. The tables have turned where at first he was the one initiating and now it's only me initiating. He's a good person: stable, caring, funny, loving to his family and friends, willing to explore my interests. I feel so much peace and consistency with him (at least before this THING happened). I just don't know how I can build this friendship/relationship without further friendzoning myself. It sucks that covid19 is happening and we wouldn't be able to go out and do normal date things too. It's been a month since our big conversation and new status as 'friends'. Do I keep putting in effort to text and call him, or would that make him value me less since I keep initiating? If I stop and he doesn't pick up the slack would that cool things off to the point of no return? Do you think he still likes me or is too polite to say I'm just a friend and he has no feelings whatsoever? Can feelings be rekindled or once it's off it goes on a downward trajectory? I don't know what I can change given that I've asked him what concerns him or is stopping him and he doesn't know. Any ISFJ men in relationships with ENFP women? So far I've seen a fair share of happy relationships/marriage and also an ENFP girl hanging on as a FWB, I don't want that. Really hoping our friendship will continue to a proper relationship. Tempted to keep this experiment up and see when he finally texts or calls me.


Please advise! He's probably the first ISFJ man I've met, I made him do the test and he's in the 50-60% range for all 4 categories so not an extreme ISFJ. He might see this since I've enlightened him about MBTI but I don't even care now. Just hope to have the best chance of working out with him.",1592042080

isfj,"A few years ago I realised that I've spent some 6-7 years just helping people around me and putting my own interests aside. Always running around helping my friends for whatever needs they had meanwhile my mental health was slowly getting worse and worse each year. I had two severe depressions in the past, one was when I felt worthless because I thought my friends would just leave me for others and whenever they met someone new and told me about their new friends I would be frustrated and jealous. The other depression was at a time when I realised my friends from high school were all drifting apart and my closest friend and I stopped talking. I couldn't accept the fact that everyone was moving on with their own lives, pursuing whatever goals they had etc. It was only after I accepted this that I myself moved on but I've changed considerably. Now I'm mostly staying away from people and avoiding making new friends for the last 3 years. I'm usually cold when someone approaches me and it takes a lot of time for me to get used to them. I guess I've been kind of cold anyways but not to this extent. Except for my two close friends, I'm not calling or texting anyone too. At the same time, whenever I get to help a dear friend I feel accomplished and happy. However, if someone else is helping them with anything then I would feel jealous again so I can't seem to get over this feeling though it is not as severe as in the past. However I must say that I don't like the person I am right now and definietly need to change. For the last few years I feel like I've been missing out on a lot of things in life too.

isfj,"Wanted to post this here and see what people thought on it. Vivi's a great character and deserves some justice and spotlight for her character. Tell me your thoughts down below and opinions.

Myers-Briggs One Piece Character Typing

Why Vivi is an ISFJ in One Piece:

Vivi is driven by duty, honor, and her desire for security in rough situations and fulfilling her duty as a princess and stopping Crocodile, who is ENTJ, trying to stop him at all costs to save her country and her people from his evil plans. She cares about tradition, rules, and her duty as a princess and really holds herself accountable for that. The entire Alabasta saga she was worrying about Alabasta and past events and she constantly thought about past memories, past events, and experiences when she arrived and traveled through Alabasta and the arc when they got there. Vivi's duty as a princess is everything for her and she loves her country and puts the needs of others over her own and is always thinking of other peoples emotions and well being and constantly wants to help others and feels its her duty to help others and her people explaining her Si and Fe in the story.

Vivi is very humble and calm and she's a very level headed character. We even see this in her as a child when she was a kid during the Drum Island Arc flashback in the Reverie with Wapol, Dalton, and King Cobra and we see how she stayed perfectly calm and apologized to Wapol when he hit her even when she did nothing wrong and only cried later behind the scenes after the conflict. We see her look down on Wapol for not doing his duty as King and for being a bad person. She hates taking risks and values security above all else to the point she gets surprised at Luffy's bravery for adventure and risk taking with him and the other straw hats as we saw in arcs like Little Garden when we meet her first besides Whiskey Peak and Reverse Mountain in the story. There's my evidence and discussion for why Vivi is a clear ISFJ and how her duty as a princess, fixation on past experiences to drive her actions moving forward, and constant desire for helping others and thinking of other peoples emotions over her own explain her Si and Fe showcased in the story of One Piece and further explain clearly why Vivi is an ISFJ. Her Si and Fe is so strong that she felt she couldn't possibly leave her people behind and abadon her duty as Princess of Alabasta just to be with the Straw Hats, which is the very reason she decided to stay behind in Alabasta and stay the princess. She's definitely not ESFJ and uses Si way more, an example of an ESFJ in the series is Nami to contrast her character, Nami's an Fe dom not a Te dom but that's a discussion to talk about for another day and time. Vivi is definitely ISFJ and uses Si way more often for the reasons I stated above. Hope you enjoyed the read, will write some more character analysis in the future.

Sometimes we INFJ‚Äôs get called ‚Äúunicorns‚Äù but I am here to tell you that an ISFJ man is something magical. I have worked with this guy for 2 years. He is so genuinely kind, sweet, and patient. (He‚Äôs also a little awkward and shy.) At one point I was certain he was the nicest guy on the planet, then I slowly realized that he was treating me ‚Äúextra nice‚Äù and might have feelings for me.  At the time, I was in a relationship, and treated him just as a friend. 

He kind of keeps to himself and is quiet around most people, but sort of ‚Äúlights up‚Äù and act more outgoing around me. He actually makes an effort to engage in conversation and smiles and laughs a lot when we talk. He is always over-the-top helpful.  I‚Äôve also caught him looking at me quite a few times, so I feel pretty confident that there are some feelings on his end. 

Several months back I separated from an abusive relationship. I am still in the midst of that, and was just enjoying chatting with him more and getting to know him even better.  The more I thought about how great of a guy he was, I started thinking that maybe I would tell him how I felt if I reached a point where I was ready and able to date or even just get closer (outside of a work setting).

Then I found out he‚Äôs getting transferred to another building!  

I feel like I am still only able to offer friendship at this point, but I‚Äôm afraid if one of us doesn‚Äôt say something, I‚Äôm never going to see him or talk to him again. :(

I have been chatting him up more or finding excuses to talk. I smile at him and laugh a lot when we talk - even if his jokes are cheesy. lol! I tell him how much I appreciate his help all the time. (Clearly I suck at flirting). 

I kind of think he‚Äôs getting the message, but he has not said anything. He just smiles at me with a sort of ‚ÄúI can tell you like me, too‚Äù kind of grin sometimes. 

What should I do?  Am I going to have to be the one to confess my feelings first?  And what do I even say? I mean, I think you need to finish one chapter before you start the next, so all I can really offer right now is friendship.  Should I just say nothing at all and let it end like this?

Any advice is appreciated.  Thanks!",1591675247

isfj,"Hi, everyone! For just over a year I have been reading/studying MBTI, and it has explained a lot about my behaviors. 

I have joined several MBTI groups, and while I enjoy them, they seem to be focused more on Intuitive thought and behavior. This reddit group is one of the few exceptions to my experience, and the people I have interacted with so far have been great!

As an ISFJ, I love meaningful discussions and getting to know others. This is why I decided to start a Facebook group.

The group is called, ""MBTI (Myers-Briggs) Chat and Support"". It is private, but not secret. I will happily accept anyone who is interested, but I would like to focus on ISFJs/sensors like us.

isfj,"So generally I'm the type of person who avoids confrontation and conflict - I'll just bottle things up and internalise things. As an ISFJ, I also tend to dwell on past experiences, interactions, scenarios, etc.

Today I was waiting in a queue to enter a store. With all the precautions for coronavirus, it was a reasonably long queue, perhaps 5-10 minutes wait in length. As the queue was moving along a woman jumped the queue right in front of me. Usually in these scenarios I'd just act passive aggressively and hold a grudge. But today I had a burst of energy and the courage to just not give a fuck and instead confront her. Being completely new to me, I mumbled out something like ""excuse me, there's actually a queue"" as I gestured to the end of the queue. She understood and moved to the back without hesitation.

Naturally all I could think of for the rest of the day was this brief (and successful) interaction I had. But it was relieving to be the person I aspire to be, even if it was just for a brief moment. I've learnt that sometimes I need to be a bit more confrontative, as long as it's civil and polite. It's certainly healthier and more productive than bottling things up and internalising things.

I'm keen to understand how others usually approach these sorts of scenarios or how you've learnt to minimise internalising things.",1591610214

isfj,"i have brought up somewhat of a similar thread related to whether anyone ISFJs had severe depression accompanied with schizotypal personality disorder in specific ( excluding dependent and avoidant PD for one ), but i didn't get anyone who mentioned they did. only one person who had generally gave information that ""mental illness"" runs in their family, and they had an ENTP schizophrenic family member, but not specifically for the things i was addressing.

i was just wondering if there are any ISFJs, which this probably would only apply to male ISFJs, since it would be more ""rare"" to find ISFJ females exhibiting these behaviors, but any ISFJs as mentioned, feel endangered more towards others, in the sense that you're vulnerable to be provoked or triggered, you ended up having episodes of physical violence and hurting other people that provoked or instigated you, etc. 

it also doesn't have to be directly, but could be from being in a situation that you become belittled over time repeatingly, while simultaneously not having anyone else to be supported by or relate to, and so, this makes you feel so weak and stabbed in the heart, that you can't take it anymore and lash out violently, breaking things physically in the environment, throwing chairs, and almost unintentionally hitting someone. at least, this experience happened for me when i had spent time in mental health case management setting many years back, that i had attended because i was hoping i could eventually meet like minded people or a diverse enough group of people where i could get a more ""good"" experience, but unfortunately, all the groups did were worsen me and made my mental illness worse. i didn't relate or like the people and finally, after one year or so, i had a violent episode, breaking things, throwing a chair, etc, as the group members walked out and then the police shortly arrived and had escorted me out. 

i was wondering if there are any ISFJs who had similar experiences. because from my experience of spending time in mental health groups in person for many years, i have yet to come across ANYONE like this, regardless of whether they were an ISFJ or not. do note, most of these types of experience only had occured in my household, caused by my ESFJ brother who i hate and don't get along with, as well as my narcissistic ENTJ father who is abusive of course to everyone. luckily, after a violent episode that originally was initiated by my father that provoked me with his whole nasty lecturing and communication, i had to shut him up and teach him a lesson, of course, regardless of what i do, people still don't change, yet this is what i find ironic, because there is all this bullshit that other MBTI types say the ISFJ does wrong, yet they are too ignorant and stupid to realize that what they are doing is actually the wrong thing, not the ISFJ. so in other words, the whole ""ego syntonic'"" thing people say about those with PD is actually totally misleading, because if anything, this whole concept would apply to typical people who don't even have a personality disorder, but again, because typical people or ""normal"" people who are like this, are that stupid and ignorant, this doesn't affect them one bit. 

but anyways, with that initial episode with my father, my brother also heard what was going on and then became part of the picture. while in the episode, i punched a hole in the wall, and was screaming and my brother made my emotions come out more pronounced, as i was crying, i was telling him while my mom ( mediator ) was standing next to us, that you are the most unreasonable person ( and he is ), ESFJ like him, are not only the most unreasonable, but also very ignorant, disrespectful, shallow,  guilt tripping horrible people..., so after all this happened, what happens? me becoming more abused and traumatized and scarred, where as my brother and father remain functional typical people as they are, unchanged, still displaying these shitty traits. i actually feel that Extroverts in general are the ""ego syntonic"" type of people in the sense that they do more harm to others than to themselves, although, it could also be pretty much anyone else that's not like me or isn't an ""ISFJ"", but i don't like the ISFJs i've met either here on reddit, or other forums, and real life ISFJs, the majority of them, i don't like or relate to, and envy them, and unfortunately, since no other MBTI type matches me, i have to go back to seeing myself as an ISFJ...., despite not wanting to connect to them...., an example would be one of my cousins in particular, who is i'd say ""relatively healthy"" or ""functional"", and married, and although when she had visited, it may have been more pleasant with her around that the typical people i have to force myself to spend with usually, i still do not like her. 

with my situation, i'd feel more safe and less ill if my brother and father took off and lived somewhere else where i didn't have to worry about them having any sort of impact on me, either directly or indirectly, or having any sort of indirect or direct influence on me, because as long as they are around in the situation and circumstances present, from past, present, ongoing, things won't get any better, and only will get worse, and i'm afraid that one day, will be so bad, i might end up sending one of them or myself to the hospital from anger and rage, where as if they were not within my vicinity, maybe i could feel more at ease and perhaps do things for myself to be more comfortable with my existence and functionality. it's sad that the only ""ISFJs"" that were more like me, were usually people i noticed being either portayed in reality tv shows and / or those who were from likely very poor households and / or living circumstances ( most of them from the same nationality or similar background as me, Persian / Iranian / Middle eastern ), and / or were random encounters in real life, and although you didn't get the full picture of their lives more personally, i felt more connected with them because they were more inferior and troubled with real problems, and endangered to both themselves or others, so either they could get physically or emotionally harmed by others or do the same back to others. 

but in mental health groups, i did not meet any of these types of people that i had bump into in real life or open world random situations. and for any ISFJs that i did meet in mental health groups as mentioned, i didn't like them, relate or connect with them. and nobody with specifically schizotypal personality disorder mentioning their diagnosis and commorbid with depression, even if they did or didn't say their diagnosis, it wouldn't have mattered, because if there was a connection and like minded individual, then it would have been clicking or felt, but there wasn't any experience like that, and for any potential ones, the individuals didn't come and stick around as much as i did, this is also what i didn't get, because one one end, it would seem that ISFJs for one, being more common, should expect more variation, and two, they'd ought to be more common in ""social"" settings, and that might have been the case with the ones i DIDN'T like or relate to, but for the rare encountered ones, these guys were no shows usually and only stuck around for a very short period, but me, i had attended the same place on and off for years, up to several times a week, but the type of people i bumped across where no different than the usual type of people i didn't already like or relate to online in these types of forums. 

long story short, been seeking mental health services since 2011 till now, seen many therapists, psychologists, tried many different types of mental health groups in person, venues, online forums, etc. i didn't get diagnosed with major depression +  schizotypal personality disorder until 2013 or 2014, before that, it was just diagnosed as ""anxiety"" and ""Depression"". i've been seeing my current psychologist for about 2 years now. i do not take any current psychiatric medications and have already done a lot of extensive research on the appropriateness of them as well as the types, etc, and have been prescribed a few before and tried them. one psychiatrist wrongly attributed how i mentioned to her as having anger to symptoms of ""psychosis"", at least, thinking that a antipsychotic would help my anger, not only did it not do anything helpful, it made me barely able to eat, sleep, etc, and on the third night, i ended up being rushed to the hospital from it's ""side effects"" that developed to convulsions, brain shaking, screaming and crying, unable to breath, etc.",1591560406

isfj,"I think I'm really stereotypically Ti when I encounter something NEW or that matters a lot (eg. information for an important exam). I want to figure out the reasoning behind things and explain them to myself procedurally before I'm ready to accept them and move on. 

However, if it's something I have enough experience with to know generally how it goes, or it's an overwhelmingly large and complex project, I'm pretty happy to just pick a solution or let other people take up different parts of the project and 'just get it done' (without needing to know the nitty gritty). I also like modularising and scheduling things at a higher level before zooming into the details. I've read that SJ types like controlling the environment around them, and I guess our fear of unexpected possibilities (inferior Ne) would lead to us making plans, managing people, allocating resources, etc. If we've worked on similar types of projects before, Si/Ti creates internal scaffolds in our heads of how to organise people and tasks, so we can be pretty good at this. Also, if we've had past experience with this going too far and turning into anxiety-driven micromanagement, we might choose to consciously take a step back and accept solutions that work and get the job done without worrying about if it's the Optimal Solution. 

Not trying to suggest that ISFJs would get mistaken for Te doms, lol. but I've noticed that a lot of (more superficial) descriptions of Te - liking managing people, getting things done, implementing solutions out of the box- can feel relatable because of these reasons. 

I'd love to know if yall feel if this applies to you! Or if you're a Te user/ have experience with them, how would actual Te feel different from the ISFJ way of implementing tasks?",1591518318

I fuss over my friends a lot and worry about them quite often (I swear I‚Äôve aged 50 years) because I do genuinely care about them, but they rarely ask if I‚Äôm doing okay. Maybe it‚Äôs because I put on a very good facade of being okay and great or whatever (even if I am not okay lmao), but I don‚Äôt really get asked. 

I know it‚Äôs not because of who they are because they quite often worry about other people and express their worry about them to me, and I don‚Äôt blame them.

Had a close friendship with ISTP coworker. About 2 years ago, ISTP slowly started cutting me out of his life. I tried asking on several occasions what I had been doing wrong as a friend that was upsetting him, but kept getting ""you're just overthinking things"" every time. ISTP continued to cut me out which caused me more stress. Eventually he started lying to our boss on a couple occasions to get out of some responsibilities he didn't want to do knowing full well it would land on my shoulders. This caused me to come uncorked at him and make a scene at work a couple times. I have since then turned him in to our boss on several occasions for screwing around and passing his work onto others. Needless to say, we are not friends anymore. 

His birthday is coming up and I have an odd desire to try to get him a present anonymously somehow. You know, just to try to do something nice for a change. Not to open up a religious debate or anything, but I am Christian and a key command is to do good unto others, even if they hate us (I obviously haven't been doing a good job at that).

You said that you weren't intending to conceal that account from your peers, that you were unconcerned even if your coeval friends found out about your secret stash-- that's utter bullshit. All of your actions from what I experienced contradicted with what you blurted out before, and you truly want to keep all of your stan feelings to yourself, and distrust others.

3.) I have deactivated my Twitter accounts as Twitter does not pique my interest anymore so you just feel free to post whatever shit you like. I couldn't possibly read your post anymore especially if you change your tag and make your account private.¬†

4.) You should be more strict and rigorous in saying ""NO"". Don't be overly polite in places where politeness is gonna hurt you. This will make you extremely vulnerable to harassment and unrighteous manners from other people, as you always give people a false sense of consent and welcome. It could be dangerous.¬†  


Instead of saying, ""\`\`\`idc if other people find out\`\`\`"", try saying, ""\`\`\`Don't harass my privacy, go suck your dildo elsewhere.\`\`\`""; instead of saying, ""\`\`\`Sure\`\`\`"" to a request that you don't admire, try saying ""\`\`\`FUCK OFF\`\`\`"";¬† \~instead of saying, ""I'm horny"", try saying\~ ... wait, that shouldn't be there. Unread that.¬†

5.) Be honest.¬†

If you be honest that I'm unwelcomed to your fan account in the first place instead of just trying to give permission to anything, I would have left you alone earlier. I don't want to be in a place where I'm not welcomed either.¬†

You will just hurt yourself and others more whenever the truth isn't there. If you just say that you blocked me when I asked you, I would just accept it that I'm predating your privacy and would be significantly less upset. When you didn't point it out, you leave me hanging, you filled me with uncertainty, you make me feel in the wrong yet you don't specify what, you make me lost trust in you as your words are contradicting.¬†  


Just be honest, honesty is the best policy.¬†

6.) Let's not talk about this any more unless if you really wanna share your interest to me for some odd reason. (Which I don't mind btw)

7.) You made me write an apology letter at 4:40 in the morning and I don't know how I feel about that.¬†

8.) Lol the way you write stuff on there is adorable btw

9.) Goodluck.  


10.) When will this end?

11.) Seriously I'm tired now.

12.)...

13.) ???

isfj,"ENFP here. Yesterday, I accidentally found my ISFJ friend's secret Twitter account. I asked him about it, yet he kept denying that it was his and made a lot of stuff up. The similarity was just uncanny, it couldn't not be his.

Alas, I got to make him speak the truth (I didn't abuse him). 

It was a fan account, he got a pretty impressive amount of follower counts and the people he's stanning actually followed him back.

I then asked him if I could follow him, he agreed so I did. It went ok at first, he asked me about my opinion on his recent posts, informed me about some drama that had happened and stuff like that. 

But today, he blocked me, and made his account private. It didn't say that I've been blocked, it just that I couldn't follow him. I confronted him about that, he lied once again that he didn't block me, and he made his account private was because of the backlash he was getting on his recent posts. 

I experimented, of course, try blocking my other account, and was able to make it have the same effect that it didn't specify that I've been blocked yet I couldn't follow my other account.

I informed him that, he immediately unblocked me and made his account public again, yet I already acknowledged that he didn't want me there, so I unfollowed him. I still checked on his tweets, however, to see if the backlash is true, yet I see the most recent post that he forgot to delete, saying that the reason he had made his account private was that someone was stalking him. 

I knew it was directed at me. I became upset, really upset. I was just supporting him for his interests and even listened to him when he was telling me the things about the people he's stanning. I never shamed him or told anybody else. 

I replied to his post, saying that I was just trying to support him and now I will leave. He proceeded to delete that post and blocked me again. 

I'm currently still very upset and have lost trust in him as he lies so much. Idk what to do.  I know that he might be ashamed that someone who knows him personally finds out about his fan account, yet still is a bit unhappy that he didn't just say no to my following request the first time, and for not being honest.

Simply put, this means that our work often tends to increase in complexity and get drawn out with more and more time. And so, self-imposed time constraints could possibly change the way you approach your work and thus, help you optimize your output.

This would agree with the fact that my ennagram comes out with a typical number for infj and infp, I'm 4w5.

1. I don't know who am I ! I used to the MBTI test on 16personalities website but I have always thought about the ways I get questioned is really boring that I can't actually give any accurate answers and always ended up INFJ/ENFP - T (One of both everytime I get a different one). I Stumbled on a website someone gave away the way the questionnare was written, was in a really good way, I got ISFJ/ISTJ in a really close cognitive score. the description of the ISTJ and ISFJ and it really was so close to who I am ! but how do I know ? I have deluded myself for years as being an extrovert while I actually end up dead dry of energy after any meeting, I always want to be alone and I enjoy it !
2. I am suffering some weird symptoms and they have been increasing furiously for years, I am almost losing any sign of control over them !

When I was a child I was exposed to 3 consecutive deaths, to the people who raised me which were my grand parents, then I was exposed to kidnapping and street mugging... all when I was a child and my dad was a really furious guy and unbearable to be around, he always mocked me when I spoke up about my feelings.

I grew up really nice on the outside, always smiling and I have nearly mastered how to smile and how to glare scaring anyone, but in reality I always enjoyed being scary, I have always wanted to kill everyone and rage like an animal. I have been containing myself because I don't dare to hurt innocent individuals, but I have grown really furious and  with every year added to my age I became the bully for the muggers and an enemy to my father, I distant myself from the world. Every year I get a frenzy of losing everyone, I keep a very few amount of people and I start deleting everyone else and getting them out ! Now what is scaring me Is when I do that, everywhere I go I see them ! I hear them ! as if they are chasing me ... I keep sitting in places they were once there with me before, I hear them and see them... I feel like exploding and crying, I hear my grand parents and feel them but it's nor realy.

I feel like I have psychosis !! And I have been spending most of my time now listening to (Anime music videos) and focusing on the expressions of those kind characters that end up raging so hard like for example (Kamui from gintama) and I feel so related, I feel so like exploding and start hurting myself and everyone else along the way....

isfj,"and if you're diagnosed with any, what exactly are your ""Symptoms"". from what i observed, almost every single person if not all of them i met online or in person ( mental health groups ), were not ISFJs, but different types for either schizophrenia / schizoaffective disorder. there might have been some ISFJs in real life or elsewhere who have been bipolar II / had dependent / avoidant personality disorder, but not specifically schizotypal PD, or even paranoid PD for the matter or other conditions that typically wouldn't be found in ISFJs.., the only source i found of what potentially could have been an ISFJ with schizophrenia, was from a youtube video of a lady with simple schizophrenia and i somewhat related to her, at least with her demeanor ( i'm a male btw ). 

almost every single person i've encountered that had schizotypal PD was stereo typically either an INTP, INTJ, INFP, ENTP possibly, but not ISFJ..., my conclusion was based off them reporting their types but also observing the way they talked and communicated ( i didn't relate to them ). and i understand that not relating doesn't necessarily mean that for some of them that you didn't relate to, that they wouldn't be ISFJ, however, i'm very specific in what i mean by not relating ( hard to explain ), but hopefully if everyone factors in all the details and questions i asked and answers them fully and ""properly"", then i can get my points understood better...

and to be able to have a proper answer back, ,i need people to give exact symptoms of their condition. so specifically if you have a form of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, please give the full details of how you got your diagnosis and symptoms, what you have and what you apparently don't have. like if you have delusions of hallucinations, please specify this in detail of what it looks like, and which exact type of schizophrenia you have, for example, simple schizophrenia or paranoid schizophrenia, for schizoaffective disorder, whether it's the unipolar depressive type or the bipolar type. 

also, for the sake of the matter, i'm just gonna treat schizotypal personality disorder as a NON psychotic disorder, because sometimes it may get confused as being somewhat a ""psychotic"" like or on the schizophrenia / psychotic spectrum or having periods of brief psychosis, etc, however, i'm gonna base it off my own phenotype which doesn't have the typical odd symptoms and ways of being / communicating, because i don't relate to the majority of people with schizotypal PD.",1590698822

I have trouble deciding on a career path. I have so many interests and it‚Äôs never ending what I want to do, become and learn. I envy people who stuck with their degree in school and have jobs in that field :(

Hello, everyone. I've been extremely conflicted about my type for years now, yet the constant quest for who I am still lingers inside because I feel a desperate need to discover who I am. It‚Äôs strange, the mystery of who we are. So hauntingly beautiful, like a ghost. We live and die, a constant cycle of learning and growing and perishing. What especially confuses me is that I keep seeing different angles, different shadows of who I am. It‚Äôs the strangest paradox. In preschool, I wished I could wander alone with my thoughts for companions, away from my peers, so comforted in who I am. Yet I grew into a monster and lost myself, became ensnared in a world that clouded me from who I was. It took so long for me to learn, to expand my mind and heart, to become who I am today. The little glimmers always danced inside but time has ignited them and I‚Äôve become so much more. So much more understanding, compassionate, open minded. I‚Äôve transcended and learned and on this journey everlasting, I feel an unquenchable need to find myself. I was unsure of how to write this post and what approach to take but I think I will try and describe myself based on the thinking, feeling, intuitive, and sensing spectrums, and hope they can capture this wild enigma that I am.  I‚Äôve attached a poll but also it would be helpful if you could explain why you perceive me a certain way.

-Thinking: I‚Äôve never found myself particularly logical, but I‚Äôve always been dazzled by the world of knowledge. As a child, Wikipedia to me was so beautiful and infinite, a galaxy of anything and everything. I loved wandering there and letting myself shift like a tide. I didn‚Äôt feel the need to probe into the entire website but whenever I felt curious I loved visiting there. It was like a refreshing little haven, so intriguing. I became particularly fascinated with rocks and minerals for some time and obsessively researched about them. I‚Äôve always felt more sentimental but recently I‚Äôve begun to feel more rational, and it frightens me. My mom and I were walking and I felt myself at first get lost in the beauty of nature but I began to wonder where the wind came from, how it seemed to be alive. My mom said that it was God moving but I was curious about the scientific explanation too. I‚Äôve always felt that nature could be an expression of God but that it always held a scientific veil too, an orchestra of equations and laws beneath that. I struggle with efficiency and have a tendency to procrastinate intensely, I just feel terrified deep down of imperfection and that causes me to prolong anything until the last moment because I feel that I need the pressure to shape my work into a diamond. To be as valuable as possible. In Freshman year I did become a little Machiavellian which I despised myself for, a boy in my group didn‚Äôt seem to care about my project as much and it ignited my frustration because I felt that the project could have become so much more beautiful and better but he didn‚Äôt seem to care, so I interrogated him about why he didn‚Äôt care about the future. It hurts now. Not everybody feels the same way that I do, why did I have to be so narrow minded? I used to be so black and white but now I‚Äôve grown and understand that different people have uniquely different minds, and I‚Äôve come to embrace that because there‚Äôs such a beauty to it.

-Feeling: I‚Äôve always been a fragile child, the stars of my emotion combusting constantly inside of me. I have a sentimental heart and yearn for one day finding sheer, pure love, the way it felt so long ago beneath glowing Christmas lights and a warmth wrapping me. Even though I hide beneath an icy veil because the world seems so hard, deep down I long for fields of love and growth and hope. I just want to become a better person and bring compassion and truth into the world. I just want others to see how deeply I love them and for my emotions to thaw the pain inside. As a child I‚Äôve always craved for affection. Sometimes it feels like I used to be an Fe user because I was attuned to the feelings of others. When a girl in preschool cried, I wandered to her when I wasn‚Äôt supposed to and befriended her because she seemed so lost and hopeless. But over time that thawed and my emotions drowned in the coldness. In elementary school I felt so estranged and ostracized by my peers, so I hissed at them. I felt that they were constantly laughing at me and I was so wounded. I used to care too deeply about what others thought, telling my brother to stop crying in front of guests because it felt impolite. I became terribly ensnared in a world of gossip and drama in middle school and shattered so many beautiful people, I still feel the echoes of those monsters today. My emotions have become deeply internal and although they feel so ghostlike and detached from me at times, other times it feels like constant streams of feeling pouring inside of me. Pain, anguish, terror, hope, all restless birds inside. My diary became my closest friend because I could confide in it. I am sometimes good at noticing the emotions of others, other times I can be oblivious. I have a deep desire to grow and to become a better person. When I saw a video of the horrors of the animal industry I became so alarmed that I became vegetarian the next day. My mistakes constantly torment me and I feel so disgusted with the person I used to be, sometimes I wish I could brandish the past forever. It aches.

-Intuition: I feel like my intuition and dreams have died over time. Everything feels so far away. As a child I had a shimmering imagination and loved to craft little stories in my head, they weren‚Äôt extremely fantastical like horses slaying unicorns but they were little scenarios. Daydreaming, even just for a few minutes, felt so magical and natural to me. I always used to dream of a better life. I lied to my teachers that we had a hope diamond in our backyard and that we mom was a famous actress because deep down I felt unsatisfied with who I was. It was a constant gnawing inside. When I gossiped in middle school, most of the stories I made up were from my imagination or had my own twist (I still feel disgusted with that girl). I loved looking at magazines and creating stories behind them, my own systems and laws. In middle school especially I loved daydreaming about the future and who I would marry, who I could be. But over time I‚Äôve begun to feel constricted by my future because of my parent‚Äôs black and white expectations for me and the beauty has withered. Even though I veil myself inside thousands of poems tumble inside of me, waiting to come alive. I don‚Äôt speak in metaphors but when I write they come naturally to me, like waves, especially spilling from myself when I write poems. I used to find such a fascination with conspiracy theories. I would spend so much time watching videos on YouTube about conspiracies about the government, paranormal stories, and debates about certain issues. I loved to consider different perspectives and debates always intrigued me for that reason. Even now my heart leaps when I get notifications for videos about debates about aliens or wars, I just love getting lost in different points of view because the discussions ignite that old fire in me. But now I‚Äôve felt so empty and hollow and detached from my curiosity. Everything feels so glaringly empty. I still wait for my heart to leap again because that feeling makes my life feel so meaningful again.

-Sensing: I‚Äôve always found nature beautiful, entrancing. Pictures of autumn were so magnificent to me that I spent days saving them, they warmed my heart with their kaleidoscope of colors. Starry skies and swirling winds and sparkling lakes, like breaths of stories. But sometimes I have to tell myself to appreciate them inwardly because they don‚Äôt capture me. It‚Äôs strange. I‚Äôve always been quite detailed while writing and can write extremely vivid descriptions, but they come from within. For example, I could describe an emerald lake frosted with envy and years of lurking secrets, but I don‚Äôt describe them from the outside world, they stem from my imagination, from my heart. I‚Äôve always been quite talented with singing and music and have a fairly good grasp of fashion (I became obsessed in middle school), but they never felt fulfilling to me the way that writing did. I struggle with hygiene and brushing my teeth and combing my hair because it feels so agonizing and meaningless. I was extremely uncoordinated and clumsy to the extent that my janitor teased me for spilling chocolate milk in elementary school, but I was strangely elegant with ballet, the music almost seemed to let my curse vanish and I became like a swan. Whenever I feel stressed I love to escape into warm showers because they feel so healing to my thoughts and like a home for me, liberating me from the fright and clamor of life. As a child I remember associating the feeling with Chopin by Nocturne, like an autumnal catharsis. I can be aware of my environments when I try and can be strangely observant but then there are times when I‚Äôm holding my loofa in my hand and wondering where it went in the shower. As a child I was notorious for constantly losing my glasses and important possessions, I still struggle with being absent minded and leaving my coats behind, to the extent that I aggravate my teachers. I‚Äôm quite nostalgic and find the past lovely and enchanting, sometimes I wish I could escape in that realm but it also feels monstrous and suffocating when I think of my mistakes. I tend to romanticize the past, falling in love with old novels and music and the feelings I used to feel because they all carry a depth that feels so long ago. I love letting them wash over me because it feels so healing and reviving. Especially Jane Eyre. It felt like a balm to my heart, the thunder and story of how Rochester and Jane met and her thoughts, swirling and capturing me forever.",1590194372

In the event I saw one of his friends, who is a man too. The guy initiated talking to me and he hugged me to greet me. Apparently, my friend did not know I knew this guy.

He kept kind of staring at us from afar as I talked to this guy ( I could tell by my peripheral vision), and after some time, he came up to us and said this:

‚ÄúHave you met, ( name of his friend), then?‚Äù After that, I greeted this friend and he stayed with us for some time, Idk If he was trying to find something to talk about, but things got awkward and in the end we all went to talk to other people.

I‚Äôve been experimenting with ways to reach a state of flow, in order to improve my focus and increase my output.

Little did I know that this has a lot to do with the challenge that a task presents, as well as my ability to undertake that task. I‚Äôve realized that the sweet spot where you tend to reach your flow is when your skills are fully involved in overcoming a suitable challenge.

If you‚Äôre wondering how you can attempt to enter a state of flow with whatever you‚Äôre working on, this is what has helped me.

1. Eliminate Distractions (Both Internally and Externally)
2. Avoid Multitasking
3. Use a Time-based Productivity Technique
4. Have a Clear Outcome or Goal in Mind

isfj,"As a concerned older brother, I need some advice. My sister (18), who I'm at least 90% sure is an ISFJ, has been almost unbearable for the last few months. It's honestly like walking around on eggshells trying not to make her upset because when she does, it blows up into an explosively huge deal. 

She can also be incredibly emotionally domineering, and when something even slightly irksome happens, her mood sours immediately and all of a sudden she decides to lace an otherwise innocuous activity with barked orders and demeaning insults for seemingly no reason.

Also recently she's taken to dishing out incredibly biting personal attacks (again, pretty much at random) when I decide to relax and be a goof while I let my guard down , which as an ENTP is already kind of a hard thing for me to do. And then she has the nerve to say behind my back that *she* doesn't trust *me*, which, again as an ENTP, is a sensitive spot and saying that is like twisting the knife.

Even when sometimes I just need some space to quietly process things, she'll come charging in berating me for 'stewing' and telling me to 'get over yourself', completely unaware that I'm not even upset. Not that it matters, even when I'm upset and I kinda close up a bit the reaction from her is still the same. And then she'll (ironically) call me selfish and insensitive.

Also pair that with the fact that she doesn't do ambiguity at all, listens to literally only 20 songs, won't listen to alternate points of view (because you *obviously* didn't hear my point, so I'm going to say it louder), has a plethora of unhealthy habits, is completely insecure and compensates by having to be the best most-perfectest-at-everything-how-dare-you-challenge-me-now-I'm-coming-for-your-blood, and what you get is a percievably incredibly toxic individual. 

Honestly, I could completely dismantle her precious ego and values and all that, all in one fowl swoop. But because I care way too much for her and for the rest of my family, I hold my tongue because I know that doing that wouldn't do anyone any good.

I'm honestly really worried that my sister is unhealthy and doesn't want to try and get any better, and that there's nothing I can do. But I hate seeing her this way, and it makes me incredibly upset because she's old enough to know better than to treat the people she cares about like this.

isfj,"Hi everyone! I'm Derek (ENTJ). My friends and I just recently launched an MBTI based dating app called Boo, but have gotten thousands of sign ups already. After much tweaking, we finally wanted to share this with you in the hopes that this may help you find like-minded friends and loved ones.

We felt like current dating apps were really inefficient. They help you meet more people, not more of the right people. This means wasted time, money, and emotional preparation on bad dates with no chemistry. It's not just bad dates; the time and effort from swiping, messaging, arranging dates, and preparing both emotionally and physically, just for dates to continuously not work out, has led to dating fatigue and the sense that online dating is hopeless. It's also hard to tell what a person is actually like through text, only to be disappointed after meeting or the first month of dating.

What we as MBTI enthusiasts have always known is that who we are (personality type) tends to influence the kinds of people we're attracted to, and it doesn't make sense for this not to play a part in mainstream online dating.

We wanted to create a radically authentic, transparent, and empathetic dating experience where people can feel free to be themselves, because it is exactly by being yourself that the right person will come along and like and appreciate you for who you naturally are. On Boo, if someone matched with you, they‚Äôre already aware of your best and worst traits, and still decided they‚Äôd rather have you over any other type. On Boo, you‚Äôre already what each other are looking for.

As an ISFJ, you're supportive, reliable, patient, and shower the people around you with your kindness and altruism. But at your worst, you can be conflict avoidant, repress your feelings, and can be reluctant to change tradition. You‚Äôll want someone who sees the world as you do and loves you for your best, but also understands and forgives you at your worst, and would have it no other way. 

Our app is completely free, and you can download on

* Very scared of upsetting others and having them think negatively of her. Also hates people fighting and gets uncomfortable or anxious around people who are arguing.
* Tries to stay in the middle of arguments instead of choosing sides. 
* Often will hesitate when asked for her opinion on things.
* Easygoing, goes along with what other people want, allows them to choose where to eat or what to do or when to hang out. 
* Easily upset at times, but always lies that she's fine. She tries not to vent about things frustrating her too often in case she's being annoying to others.
* Loves holiday traditions, baking, cheesy gatherings with loved ones. For White Elephant last year, she bought a book full of baking recipes along with a bunch of ingredients included then once everyone guessed her in the end, she said she wants us all to have fun baking together.
* Can sometimes guilt trip people during arguments, talking about how she was just trying to be nice or how she didn't know anyone had a problem and she's sorry she was just being herself.
* Has many friends, prefers to be around people, likes hosting small parties, extremely good at complimenting people, very smiley and cheerful.
* Feels really uncomfortable and sad if someone dislikes her, and often overthinks certain social situations.
* Easily taken advantage of because she's a big pushover, is naturally flirty, and super affectionate.",1588645502

I‚Äôm a female ENFP with an ISFJ bf, who seems to be having a difficult time opening up during this time period. We‚Äôre social distancing separately and haven‚Äôt been able to see each other in 8 weeks. 

At first he responded to the challenge with enthusiasm, with lots of video calls and finding a game for us to play together online. But slowly over time he‚Äôs becoming increasingly distant, only wishing to talk over the phone 1-2 times per week. This hurt me, because I miss him and love talking to him. 

When I‚Äôve brought this up, he says it‚Äôs because he has nothing to update me on and he‚Äôs tired of all the online communication. He seems so sad and bored. :(

When I tried to get him to open up on how this time is affecting him, he lashed out a bit and said he doesn‚Äôt usually open up about his problems and he‚Äôs not very introspective. After that I stopped trying and let him be the one to reach out to me. That‚Äôs helped a bit and our calls have improved. 

I believe he still cares deeply as he makes it known it subltle ways like making plans for when we reunite and sending me silly memes. Unfortunately I still miss him and crave more communication. I feel very alone right now, like I don‚Äôt even really have a partner. Any advice on how I might be able to get him to open up?

I'm VERY far leaning on the party I affiliate myself, where this ENTP is more moderate, swinging left and right depending upon the topic. Despite how passionate I am about my own beliefs I do enjoy listening to the other side and what they say, and try to at least get where they are coming from. This has lead to long political talks between the ENTP and I even though he know he won't change my mind. That's fine.

Today in text he says that he gives anyone with my party affiliation the side eye and that they are the more evil of the two parties. Now hold the phone. There is a reason Superman and Captain America are widely considered ISFJs - we believe in justice and being good. I was also shocked he would so casually give me, essentially, a label of 'evil' despite all of our talks. 'Oh, but he didn't say YOU, he said your PARTY.' My party is in no way perfect but it is an extension of me and he knows that, and essentially, called me evil as a result. I called him out on that and told him how that insults me, and to speak in absolutes is not fair. You guys like being called on your bullshit right? Well, I did that, and asked why he would lump me into something so awful. Do you consider me to be evil? A whole hour and a half later I get simply 'no.' When I asked him to discuss it further he said he doesn't want to right now.

If this is the end of us so be it, but what the fuck, man? Why would someone that will argue anyone into a corner suddenly back down from me when I ask for an explanation on why I am evil?

We are a couple of guys who have started an MBTI subreddit. We have made it because we think that all the other MBTI subreddits are more about having fun and less about advice, at the expense of encouragement for personal growth. We aim to fill that neglected niche of people who want to grow as a person. 
This subreddit is different from the others in how we prioritize personal growth, better communication, advice, and a deeper understanding of ones self. We want to be where you can go to help each other out and better understand what makes us different, and what we all share in common. We are aiming for everyone to be friends(even when we disagree), and where you can ask questions about different types or about day to day things that affect you.

I‚Äôm not going to analyze why it happened, but my boyfriend (ENTJ) broke up with me three days ago, and he cited these as some reasons - in addition to me not being assertive or dominant enough.

isfj,"Hello fellow IxFJs! I would love some input on a current situation that I, a female INFJ (27) am in with a male ISFJ (32).

So there is a male ISFJ I am romantically interested in. We first started talking back in December, when he messaged me out of the blue asking if I'd want to go on a date. I wasn't sure I liked him at the time, but decided to give him a chance. Before the date, we're getting to know each other really well, talking constantly, conversations are interesting and engaging. However, after the first date, communication slows way the fuck down. I start to think he's not into me, so I express this to him, but he says he's still into me and wants to hang out again. So we do, and things are great in person. Honestly couldn't ask for it to go better in person, and he seems really interested and even cuddles with me. Afterward, same thing happens, communication is way lackluster again, and he seems much more distant. This continues on for a while, and I start to get to a point where it just feels like he's not into me at all since he wasn't even texting me once a day, and I got frustrated and ended it. I told him I felt like he was playing games with me because of the mixed signals, and he never corrected me, so I assumed it to be true.

Fast forward to now. We start talking again because of a common interest I messaged him about. Same thing is happening again. He was really engaging and talkative, and it's slowing down again. Yet, he tells me several times how much he admires me and thinks very highly of me. Based on these comments and how we interact in person, as well as the ""feeling"" I get about him, I really do think he's into me, but I don't understand why he is so slow to respond (I'm talking 24-48 hours between responses). From what I can tell, he seems extremely reserved and shy. I get this feeling that there's so much more depth to him, but he's holding back. And this seems to happen in our communication too, where he will start to open up about his life and be more talkative, and then will just suddenly withdraw again.

I just don't understand this inconsistent behavior and I want to know what I'm missing. Is this an ISFJ thing? How should I proceed? I have such a hard time reading him, and I can normally read people very quickly and accurately. I don't think I have a good grasp of what ISFJs are like, so I'd love some input from other ISFJs out there.

Side note: It's funny to me that ISFJs are so much more common than INFJs in the real world and yet far fewer of y'all here on Reddit. Interesting!",1588029492

The app has only just become available in the app stores (iOS and Android), but we've had thousands of sign ups already.

Firstly, we wanted to let you know about it because we thought it might be of interest. We've had lots of people get in touch to say they are having some amazing conversations and they've never connected with such great people on a dating app. Most people aren't meeting up in person at the moment due to coronavirus, and of course, safety comes first, but the app usage has gone through the roof as people get to know each other better online and make meaningful connections.

Secondly, we are refining the UI/UX at the moment and we'd really appreciate any feedback (either on here or at [hello@sosyncd.com](mailto:hello@sosyncd.com)).

It's free to sign up and it only takes a couple of minutes to do so, if you know your personality type already, which you guys obviously do! You also have the option of searching for specific personality types. You just need to search for So Syncd in the App Store or Play Store or follow the link to the website below.

We hope you are safe and well during this challenging time. Jess and Lou x

As long as they are both healthy and don‚Äôt try to project certain things on you like morals/values (INFP) or viewing a situation in a wrong way‚Äîwhich they view as the only right way‚Äîand trying to give you unsolicited advice about it (INFJ). 

I seem to have the most INTP friends (even a romance) but we never seem to connect in the common values department, so the chemistry fades over time. Also, INTPs are so hyper focused on their interests that it can be hard to talk to them about other things. This makes the relationship hard to escalate to a close friends ordeal because both intellectually (if you don‚Äôt have similar interests) and emotionally (they tend to disappear off the face of the Earth for a weeks at a time) aren‚Äôt fulfilling sometimes.

I‚Äôve realized that part of getting over boredom is to begin to get things done that give you a sense of pride or accomplishment. In other words, finding a way to progress with your goals and ambitions.

Often when we have time on our hands, we fall into patterns of behavior associated with filler activity, otherwise known as ‚Äúbusy work‚Äù. We send countless emails, browse social media, or jump from task to task. Instead it would help to let our mind wander so that we can understand exactly ‚ÄúWhat is causing our boredom.‚Äù While boredom and the constant restlessness can be frustrating, I‚Äôve realized that there are also a few benefits of it as well.

1. The mind relaxes and allows for more focus eventually
2. We start to think of how we can improve our lives
3. We begin to identify what is causing disappointment in our lives

Another thing that I want to highlight is the difference between doing and thinking. When we‚Äôre bored, we‚Äôre only thinking for the most part, but not doing things that are more aligned with our self-fulfillment.

isfj,"Today I was broken up with by my ISTJ boyfriend of a year and 6 months. We were ethnically very different, he came from Hong Kong and I was Pakistani, we were different religions and somehow we still convinced each other it would work out for us because although in sixth form, we both didn‚Äôt want to be heartbroken in the long term. Sucks to be us now.

We were both trying to get into university to study medicine, both workaholics but I was the sociable loving one and he was the awkward, somewhat charming dude. It was a love story. We went to a private school, I was there by accident (my grammar school didn‚Äôt let me in with a B) and he was there because...his parents were rich. This immediately should have been a flag too, the societal differences. I‚Äôm not saying it can‚Äôt work but it definitely helps to be similar! 

The first months were good, although I found myself cringing and have doubts in the first weeks about his intentions. He‚Äôs what you call a gentleman, charming and sweet and extremely posh. My ex was horrible, and he was an absolute cunt to me, so this chivalry was amazing to me. I was at the height of my popularity at this time, so when we got together it was amazing - everyone was supportive etc and I felt like the luckiest girl, he spent ¬£110 on me for roses, and for simple gifts time to time. The problem came where I reluctantly accepted them but found that I was unable to pay him back for these expensive gifts. I don‚Äôt come from a rich family at all. I didn‚Äôt even have my own bank account. I couldn‚Äôt afford to gift him things. I couldn‚Äôt even afford the bus home in London at times. He was too fast at wanting to have sex with me, too rushed! I was a virgin. It makes it worse that I lost it to him.

He had this allusion that every single guy was hitting on me, flirting, wanted my number and made me distance away from a number of my guy friends, even the gay ones. This was saddening but I rolled with it, I told my friends what was happening once and they called it a toxic relationship, how I wasn‚Äôt allowed to be with Jack because he was a guy, and my boyfriend would get jealous and the mood would be ruined if I did. 

Fighting happened on and off, and the days it did it was so bad, but not as bad it would be in university. I let myself feel really down and bad about things that weren‚Äôt even horrible at all, things like talking to any guy at all, things like saying he thought I was a slut at first. It was not nice but I didn‚Äôt have the guts to end anything so I rolled with it.

A levels ended, I didn‚Äôt get into medicine. He didn‚Äôt either. I became completely distracted by the guy through the year, so much so that I completely little to no work in the day even though he did. My self esteem was fluctuating but at this point I wasn‚Äôt scared to argue with him, I didn‚Äôt feel like he would BREAKUP with me if I so much so dared to lift a finger. That happened later.

My friends left me because I was deluded with him and I always hung around him. I was always just with him, and never had time to call them because he would get mad or moody and that was just the worst. These were subtle signs because he would never tell me of course, never tell me what or how he felt. I had to use my intuiton to infer. 

At university, I went to one party after telling him. He was so so so so moody and jealous and angry and threatened a break. He was impulsively yelling in the chat, saying I broke a promise of how I said I wouldn‚Äôt party 6 months ago. It broke my heart and I intended to never tell him again, if I really had to. The best thing to do was to stop partying altogether right? Even though at the party, I would text him every 20 minutes to let him know I‚Äôm okay. I only did that because of Freshers, I wanted to make some friends.

I didn‚Äôt have the energy after break 1 to continue being some anymore. I cried and cried in my room depressed and upset, about life and how unfair it was and I had this one chance to get into medicine and all, and here I was, right? He already wasted one year of mine and now he‚Äôs on a break? It was my fault where I should have ended it right there but I refused to. Out of fear.

He got back together with me and I immediately felt relief of having someone with me again and not feeling alone. I hate hate hate when I feel hated or disliked by anyone and it felt unjustified because I gave him attention and love and everything he wanted when he wanted. Except that one mistake I made.

Went to his flat, in Preston, made a lot of good memories everywhere and I loved it. But then it became toxic behaviour. From my side, arguing and arguing hurt through the week so I planned trips to his flat every-time on the weekend, or whenever the disagreement was. I became more and more scared of being broken up with. But he seemed happy after the arguments, I tried to resolve everything when we did, I treated him with the love and care of a king, because I knew what it‚Äôs like to feel emotionally abused. 

A big part of our life was FaceTiming, while working and studying. Medicine was a joint aspiration, he helped me so much with chemistry and biology and he honestly helped me pass with good grades. Now I have no one and I‚Äôm probably going to fail.

The breakdowns came later, in quarantine. While lockdown was happening, he started to say after any argument (which weren‚Äôt often by the way) but increased, that he was sick of me and the way he was being treated. I didn‚Äôt find anything wrong that I was doing, until later when he broke up and said I wasn‚Äôt buying him enough physical gifts and I called him out for gaslighting me due to a friend noticing.

I tried and tried to treat him with love. Yesterday, he said it was funny how I used to self harm and was suicidal and when asked why he would say that to me, he said it‚Äôs funny when I intentionally hurt you. I was crying on call, and he just stared at me. He said I made him insensitive, because after our break, I said I wanted him to communicate more and be more dominant with how he felt. I did not mean to desensitise into a MONSTER. 

The breaking point came today. In the morning I had a horrible gut feeling that something was going to go wrong, and it did. I wrote him a 60 word paragraph asking if we could work through issues together, instead of alone, because I feel like it‚Äôs tearing us apart and I feel unloved because of it, I feel unloved from the way he never says anything romantic or complimentary or nice anymore, barely texting me if it isn‚Äôt about himself. 

I felt ignored. Humiliated. Lied to, deprived of affection on purpose when he felt like it. He said it was to punish me to teach a lesson for making him feel desensitised. 

2:40pm he says listen. It‚Äôs over, I‚Äôm never going back on my word and it‚Äôs not a joke, goodbye. You‚Äôll find someone better.

I breakdown. I completely scream silently and cry and hit the wall and breakdown in silence, with my family oblivious downstairs. I rock back and forth and I lie silent on the ground, I try to call my friend and she tries to make me better and it helps for 2 min approximately. I‚Äôve felt this pain 4x before over this relationship and it‚Äôs the worse one yet because this time it‚Äôs for real and he‚Äôs gone. I feel unlovable and like I won‚Äôt be able to find love again, and that it‚Äôs over forever for me. I have exams on the 1st and I‚Äôm breaking in every way.

I pray to God, I turn to religion. I try to rationalise pain, systemise it. Blame myself for not sticking to ‚Äúno sex before marriage‚Äù. Hate myself for losing my virginity to him. He‚Äôs not texted, I send a love filled email to him saying I‚Äôll always be there even if it‚Äôs a year later for him, because I love him. This time I don‚Äôt beg him to take me back like I do 4x before in the relationship.

I feel weak after praying, it didn‚Äôt help that much. I call his flatmate and try to explain before he explains to everyone, in desperation. I‚Äôm panicking now, it‚Äôs gotten to me. It doesn‚Äôt make sense. I call the damn girl I was jealous of in the relationship, that‚Äôs how low I go. I explain how he fucked me up, but I can hear the glee in her voice. I hate her. I feel horrible after that.

My friend says she will call me on FaceTime and work with me for the exam, so we were sitting in silence for about 2 hours just ‚Äúworking. I cried two times and she told me to toughen up and work, and not use him as a power to fail. I don‚Äôt want to fail another year because of him. He can‚Äôt do that to me.

I don‚Äôt know how to move on but writing this has helped. I feel hot and heavy hearted, with a lot of body pain. It feels bad. I‚Äôm sweaty, got headaches and fatigue. It‚Äôs not corona. 

I want him back. I just want to know what‚Äôs going on in his head rn from an ISTJ perspective.",1587749100

isfj,"I just started reading about HSP (highly sensitive person) and I swear it would explain so goddamn much. Are there any other HSP's here who can relate to the following things?

- I get extremely irritated by noises that don't seem to bother others, at least not to the same degree. It can be people making snorting noises or eating loudly. If it goes on I will actually cry because of how much it irritates me.

- Kind of related to the first one, but I cry REALLY easily. When I was a kid I would literally cry everyday and get mocked for it. I don't cry everyday now but I still find myself struggling to hold back tears when I get mild criticism or someone raises their voice slightly at me, in other words, situations where I as an adult am not expected to cry.

- I get very affected by hunger. I either cry, lash out at others or go almost into a depressive mode. 

- I get affected by loud noises. For example, I find it difficult to be in the same room as someone who speaks very loudly on the phone, or sometimes I walk inside a room where my family is watching TV and the volume is just too loud for me. It's not too loud as in it hurts my ears, it's just kind of too loud to handle mentally. 

- I HATE violence. I am extremely sensitive to it and get really nervous when I am forced to watch anything that I know contains violence. I saw some very graphic images when I was very young and they've stuck with me until this day. I'm always scared I'll see something as graphic again and that it will affect me in the same way.

Then there are things that apply to me too that I don't know if they're specifically HSP things, like being especially moved by art and music, being conscientous and perfectionistic, getting overwhelmed when there's too much to do, needing time to relax and recover from a lot of social interaction or general stimulation, and disliking being in the spotlight and finding it hard to speak and think clearly when that happens.

But if there's anyone who actually knows they're HSP, do you relate to this? To be completely honest, I really want these to be signs of a HSP, it would just feel sooo good if there's actually a name for the way I am and that I'm not alone in it and I could learn how to handle it. Up until now I've tried to take really good care of my health and meditate everyday in hopes of being more in control of my emotions, but since not even that has worked, I would just want some sort of explanation.",1587717077

isfj,"So, I‚Äôm in high school, and for the longest time I mistyped myself as a perceived. This had to do with the fact that, from elementary school to middle school, I was homeschooled. My mother is an INFP and was really into ‚Äúunschooling‚Äù (minimal structure, letting kids learn on their own without really pushing too much), and there weren‚Äôt really any issues with this for me‚Äîuntil around the 6th grade. Suddenly, I had no drive to do my schoolwork or learn new things, and I would fight with my parents about this constantly. This continued until the 8th grade, when they decided they should enroll me in high school starting freshman year. End of 8th grade, I found MBTI and typed myself first as an ENFP, then an ENTP. Once I started high school, I adjusted and made friends quickly. My grade average was high 90s, and despite struggling with mental health issues during the middle of the year, by the end of it I was calm, organized, considered the ‚Äúresponsible‚Äù friend of my group, and typed myself as an ISFJ. I believe this was due to the structure present in a traditional school environment. I‚Äôm a chronic procrastinator, and without the pressure of an actual schedule I just would not get anything done. Historically, I‚Äôm terrible at making my own agendas. I can‚Äôt count how many little day planners i‚Äôve filled out one week in and never even thought about again. I rely on phone alarms and obnoxious reminders to get things done. So, during quarantine, my structure has collapsed entirely.

I found myself taking advantage of lack of graded assignments and have completely lost interest in learning.

See...As an ISFJ, I'm aware of what people expect of me. I'm also aware that I, as a male, am supposed to be more rational and detached. So then comes the 'mask'. The Loner badass mask.  
I used to wear leather jackets and act way calmer and chill and assertive on the outside when on the inside I felt incredibly caring and loving for everyone. Tested as an ISTP when I was going through this mask phase. 

I still go to this 'mask' on default at times but it's been relieving to finally move away from acting a part for society and finally being able to be myself and acknowledge that my kindness and compassion weren't a weakness.

For our general interaction, he is quite shy around girls and he's said that he's shy around me, but honestly it doesn't feel like it at all. Also, he studies in a state far away from the city, so whenever he comes back, we meet up. Basically our interactions are 70% through texting, especially on Instagram. We send each other memes daily and have little chats here and there. We mainly enjoy each other's company in person.

As for what I thought were hints, I accidentally saw that I was his most contacted person on Instagram. Oh! And there was a week where he'd start conversations, which he almost never does, then he never started conversations again? Maybe it was because the conversation died quite fast but I let it happen because I thought he wasn't enjoying the conversation.

isfj,"I recently learned about attachment styles in relationships; if you don‚Äôt know already, basically there are 3 types:
‚Ä¢ anxious attachment
‚Ä¢ avoidant attachment 
‚Ä¢ secure attachment

Secure attachment is the best style to have, meaning you are comfortable with yourself and your partner, and you believe all your needs are met. 

However, although I feel like I‚Äôm working towards secure, I think I have an anxious attachment style right now. 
In my previous relationship, it ended because I needed too much emotional connection and my partner was avoidant and wanted more independence. 

I feel like the anxious attachment style is partially due to being ISFJ, because I generally like to have connection and acknowledgement. Maybe I developed anxious attachment since the other person in the relationship wasn‚Äôt giving me that?? Idk

Can anyone relate? or does anyone else feel like they have somewhat of an anxious attachment style in relationships?",1587355465

However he is also prone to giving me compliments and expressing his feelings in a way that I as an ISFJ would NEVER do.

\- I've been having extreme episodes of nostalgia.  I listened to music that I listened to a few months ago, and all those emotions came back. I remembered when I listened to it, the people that were around me when I listened to it.  I just...I remember details so well. I remember what people said, how they made me feel, the emotions we felt. I have a hard time letting go of old attachments and I can't even explain why. 

\- I tend to wear masks quite often and I've mistyped as ISTP in the past. I'm male and I've always felt the need to show my compassion in 'stronger' ways. I've been broody, outwardly laid back and slightly aggressive in the past as a need to embody what a male is supposed to be. I can be quite cheerful and goofy, but often times, I'll also be assertive because I know that's what I'm supposed to be. 

\- I love being in tune with my senses. I love dancing, painting, singing, and doing sensory activities like motorbiking that stimulate my senses and are enjoyable experiences to have with others. Does anyone else enjoy those kinds of things? Those are usually considered Se 'activities', but I'm sure it could be Si as well.  

\- I tend to go 'disaster' mode when I'm stressed. I hate it when I get like this. I tend to catastrophize the future, unable to see the positive and only seeing the negative outcomes that I can see happening. I tend to drown in my feelings and start to withdraw because I feel nothing can be the way it was and that inevitably things will get worse. (Inferior Ne?)

I hide my political views, vegan diet, romantic relationships, weird interests, etc. I've gone to the trouble of hiding things in my apartment (ex: books on veganism) before she comes over. She's very vocal about her opinions, so I usually just sit and listen in agony.

Whenever I have spoken up or offered a different point of view, it turns into a huge ridiculous fight. So I just don't even say anything anymore. It's not worth it to me. She just won't ever know the ""real"" me, I guess. This isn't the case with most of my other friends. I feel much more comfortable speaking my mind around them. It's just really frustrating, but I know it's ultimately my fault for letting her walk all over me for years. I'm not sure what to do at this point. I feel like such a wuss lol

I go through each test individually and use a variety of metrics to type. Each test takes me about 45 minutes to go through. Upon completing the test, within a couple days, you will receive your type along with a detailed analysis for how I came to type you and why I eliminated certain types.

In order to ensure accuracy, the test does take about 45 minutes so please allot that amount of time. This is about the 30th or so version but it is the 2nd official version. The 3.0 version will be out soon.

He was going out to eat and posting happily about it. So I asked why aren't you doing the responsible thing, does he not care about flattening the curve. He replied that COVID was nature at work and it's an evolutionary response. He doesn't care about people dying. I just completely shut down and replied nothing. I couldn't believe he was so unsympathetic. I have muted his stories in whatsapp and instagram since then because I don't even want to see what he's upto.

* I usually step up as group leader in my classes because I find others to be incompetent and lazy.
* I'm great at saving money and always look for the cheapest yet most effective option. I hardly spend money because I enjoy seeing my bank account increase.
* I'm very good at planning, organizing, and managing my time. I always do things first minute and am on top of all my responsibilities. Before I even went to college, I planned an entire roadmap of the entire 120 units I need to take. I love to think about my future career.
* I'm a decisive person. My friends often come to me for advice about which option to choose. I've made class schedules for a lot of my friends.
* I don't talk much unless it's revolved around my interests and am on the more reserved side.
* Some friends have described me as intimidating and blunt (direct speaking, not rude).
* Everyone thinks I'm very smart and often ask me to help tutor them or see my homework answers.
* I'm assertive, action-oriented, and an opportunist. I've won multiple scholarships, got my first job at age 16, and started working a job related to my major in my freshman year of college.
* I have a bad temper and can't hold my tongue when I'm angry. I have gotten into a lot of arguments, even when I should've bitten my tongue. I've argued with a teacher, government worker, bus driver, etc. Aside from when I'm mad, I don't start drama for no reason.
* I have a lot of confidence in myself and may even seem arrogant because I sometimes brag about my accomplishments and ability to succeed.
* I have a tendency to always think I'm right and not accept other people's opinions. I can be judgmental about people who aren't the same as me.
* I'm family oriented and protective over those I care about. Although I'm polite to others, I couldn't care less about anyone who isn't in my inner circle.

first of all I have been scrolling up and down going through most of posts here and I just adore you. Also sorry for my English, please don't roast me about that since there are quite few people here and it could trigger some people.

I met this amazing ISFJ at work about a year and half ago and I have no idea how, but somehow she gained my full trust in such a short time, which is weird 'cause usually takes years for me to ever trust someone fully and open up myself. I don't even get how is this possible. I would say we became friends, but who knows she's just so nice to everyone. Well at least I value her so much and care a lot about her (I don't really seek to have tons of friends, I'd rather keep few ""quality""friendship, if it's relevant). She just have ability to be this source of calm and peace to me, for instance when I get overwhelmed by my own feelings and helps me to break them down. She's been like a bigger sister to me and I can not stretch this enough, but she's really dear and near to my heart (if I do have any, hahah).

Anyway, few months ago she left the job, moved back to her hometown, so we have been texting a lot. Still miss her everyday since we saw each other almost on daily basis and shared a desk at the office. Sometimes I recognize by the way she's texting she's feeling down for some reason even though she always tries to hide it and be cool, but when I ask, she doesn't want to talk about it. I get that and am okay with that, she's been always a bit reserved and I try my best to give her some space to process her feelings on her own if she wishes to do so. It's just I really wish I could be there for her, but don't wanna push her to anything, Just let her to decide whether she ever tells me what's going on or not. From time to time when this happens I remind her she could always reach out to me and tell me what's wrong, that I will always be there for her. I just want her to know and keep reminding her of that. And she knows I mean it since I always been honest with her about everything (and I don't really like playing those complicated games according to all kinds of social rules - she knows that too).

Today she told me she's just not used to other people actually care about her feelings or issues, so she does not open up to other people and that is why she's so reserved, and that it's always the other way around with her friends - people would reach out to her, just dump all their problems on her, she would hear them out, help them and that's it. Then she said something about how she just doesn't want to make negative impact on anybody else by telling others how she feels at the moment and also she doesn't want to bother anyone with her feelings. I felt sad about the thing with her friends because of all people I know she doesn't deserve this. Also, I don't think this is a sign of a good quality friendship, right? Or is it only my perspective and you guys are actually okay with this? I personally think it should be both ways, but idk. That's why I am asking you guys, just wanted to know views on this from people who seem to share common traits as my friend, so I could better understand her, even if it was just a bit.

Also, how do you show others you like them, value them, consider them as friends and not just some acquaintances? I am kinda dumb at these social stuff, sorry, if it upsets some of you. It's just so confusing because she's so nice to most of people and honestly I can't tell (I am not going to push her to like me back, if it's just not gonna happen her liking me back, then it's okay! Just been wondering how your minds of you guys work, that's pretty much it).

isfj,"I‚Äôm very curious to know how much innate strengths and personality traits correlate with job satisfaction.  What do you do? Do you like your job? Do you feel that your day to day responsibilities play to your strengths as an ISFJ?

For some background on myself: I graduated college with a degree in Computer science about 1.5 years ago. While in school I never felt that CS was the right path for me but pushed through because I knew I‚Äôd have a shiny job waiting for me at the end. I did well in school and landed a software developer job at a large insurance company which I‚Äôve been at for over a year. I can‚Äôt complain given the current situation but I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that I will never be happy here. Last year I performed quite well and actually got promoted despite the fact that I was completely lost and confused my first 3-4 months. I got transferred over to a new project in December and IMO it‚Äôs completely pointless. There is no process for anything, it‚Äôs highly ambiguous, the leaders don‚Äôt know how to effectively lead, and communication is severely lacking. This is not the type of environment that I thrive in. I get a lot of satisfaction when I feel like I‚Äôm good at what I do, when I‚Äôm being productive, and when I feel like I‚Äôm helping somebody. I have always been inclined to teaching / advising roles, but never pursued it. I also enjoy working with my hands and producing concrete results so I feel like dental hygiene or something along those lines would be a good fit for me. I don‚Äôt want to give up on my degree quite yet though and I‚Äôm actively looking for other positions within the tech field to see if the issue is my job and not my career.  Sorry for the rant, but I‚Äôm curious to know what you guys do and whether you love it :)",1586812249
isfj,"Hey guys! INTP here hoping for some advice from you lovely people. My SO is an ISFJ and we've been dating for 3 years now. Absolutely love them and want to be with them. 

The dilemma is my SO has a really hard time taking initiative and making life decisions like changing jobs, going back to school, getting their driving license etc. I feel like it's not my place to interfere and other than bringing it up and offering support and advice I don't push any harder than that. I cant help but notice that time keeps passing (it's been a couple years since they first mentioned wanting to do these things) and my ISFJ is staying in their comfort zone, sticking to familiar routine and not giving any indication of moving forward. 

I know the reasons for their reluctance and we've had conversations about it but what I'm asking from you all is will they ever step up on their own? Should I be interfering and pushing them to help them achieve the goals they want? And how can I help an ISFJ feel motivated?

As an INTP I feel way out of place here. I can't relate since my stronger Ne is always internally pushing me to try new things and keep progressing, and my philosophy is not to interfere in others lives. But if it will really be what they need I'm willing to go out of my comfort zone.

isfj,"Hi, all. I'm quite new to reddit, but I've been dabbling in MBTI for a little while, and so this spiral of self-doubt has been going on for some time.

The first time I had myself tested, I came out as ISTJ, but a second review on a different website drew me more to ISFJ. I was content with that for a little while, until I started getting MBTI videos in my recommended section on YouTube. Naturally, I was curious to see what they'd have to say about ISFJ types, and how they would be portrayed in media and memes and such.

The result was... distressing. I couldn't connect at all with the portrayal of the type, and a lot of things being said about it (such as that their efforts are only noticed when they're not around) just made me miserable. I have OCD, and some of my obsessions are regarding who I am and if my vision of myself is the correct one; this is important, because it's watching these types of videos that kickstarted my obsessive search for my type.

I've gotten ISFP on 16personalities, which I did not agree with, and my top three types on Truity were ISFJ, INTJ and INFJ, in that order. This has lead to even more confusion, and left me in the ISFJ-ISTJ-INFJ-INTJ square with nothing concrete. I think it's because of my fluctuating S-N and F-T that typing myself has been so difficult.

So, to start, I am an introvert, and my Judging is very strong. I know this without a doubt. While I have Prospecting traits, these are more apparent when I'm doing recreational things. I also have ADHD, so that explains away some of the other traits as well, which is why I know I'm not P enough to be confused about it.

I'm very detail-oriented, and getting the big picture is sometimes difficult as I have to process individual details first. I prefer to keep things realistic and grounded, and I observe my surroundings through what I know from the past. I'm a practical person that learns from experience rather than by studying from a book, although I prefer to stick to a manual in fear of ruining something. On the other hand, I'm a creative person that likes to brainstorm ideas and concepts for things even if I don't end up doing anything with them. I like to interpret the meaning of abstract things like songs, art and poetry, and apply them to my experiences in life. Although my daydreams are within the boundaries of realism, I do like to think about the future... if it's a good one.

While I'm generally one of the more logical people in my inner circle, I do care a lot about the feelings and opinions of others, and easily pick up on the way people are feeling. My intuition is very strong because I have a lot of experience with people's behavior, as I like psychology and analyse everything.  I've been taught to have a strong sense of empathy since I was younger, as I am autistic and used to have very low empathy. This can affect the way I make decisions, because I care a lot about the people I interact with on a daily basis and don't want to upset them, even if I might not agree. While I do enjoy taking care of people where I can, I don't like being a therapist, and I'm very bad at reassuring someone without a way to actually give them proper advice, but because of my high empathy I sometimes still feel pushed into a caretaker role, even when I'm not available, because I'll end up feeling guilty. I have a strong sense of morality and social justice, and I love to teach others about things, but this feeling of wanting to take care of others can sometimes be very inconvenient. My guilt particularly surfaces when I'm either not emotionally available, or it's about someone I'm on okay terms with, but not close; I catch myself laying myself bare even for strangers because of my combined ""I want to do good"" and ""what if nobody else does it. then that person is all alone"" feelings, which makes it easy for people with bad intentions to take advantage of me.

I try to be fair and impartial in situations where I'm in a lead position, which I like being in because it gives me control, but my emotions can get the best of me at times, and I tend to respond to emotional impulses. While I'd love to call myself a rational person (perhaps in the workplace I am), I realise that I, for the most part, am not. That said, I do tend to weigh out all the possibilities and judge based on what is objectively the best decision when it comes to things like work, finances, and planning out my schedule, which sounds very contradictory, I know! I seem to almost be an entirely different person when I work. I don't like fumbling around,  I'm straight to the point and not afraid to point out where things are going wrong and need improvement. Unless I'm working with a loved one, I prefer to do what is good for me first, and I can be very hypercritical of the prestations of other people. While I aim to treat people fairly, I take into account the personal needs of the people I care about, but my patience isn't eternal, and sometimes I tend to make my point really harshly. People have said I can come across as rough and intimidating even when I meant something well.

I know this is a lot, and if you have read up until this point, thank you very much. I'm really struggling with finding myself and this inconsistent behavior of mine really confuses me, so I'd be really glad if someone could take a crack at it. I'd love to have someone analyse me as a person and give me something I can hold onto. I know that labels aren't everything, but they give me comfort and something to turn to when it's not going so well. Thanks in advance.",1586717879

isfj,"So I took the 16 personalities test and got ISFJ but I feel I resonate with ISTJ more than ISFJ. If you could help type me to know which I‚Äôm more fit as, I‚Äôd appreciate it. 

I am an introverted person, I am not the best with kids and am skeptical of most people and their motives. I like helping others but struggle when it comes to emotion. My hobbies consist of gaming, watching horror shows, going to the gym, baking, reading and poetry. Clothing and exterior looks are important to me in the aspect that I don‚Äôt feel myself if I don‚Äôt wear things that fit my idea of what looks good on me. I have a taste for art and aesthetically pleasing architecture. I thrive off of schedules and tasks and don‚Äôt do well when I‚Äôm forced to multitask or be a leader or deal with conflict. I am organized but can be messy. I am very frugal, cannot handle criticism well and have been told I‚Äôm rigid at times. My close friends consider me to be blunt and highly dependable and loyal. Never giving up on those I care for is my biggest downfall and strength. I have no problem expressing my emotions when it comes to boundaries, how I‚Äôm feeling and feel I am take pride in communication regarding relationships. I am also fairly literate and very good at writing essays especially ones that involve persuasion. I am an acts of kindness kind of person with people whom I love and trust. When people cry in front of me I find a hard time figuring out how to react in those situations unless it‚Äôs like a boyfriend or someone I‚Äôve known for years. I like to be alone most times but don‚Äôt mind when me and my small group of friends get together. I am very resistant to change. I get drained pretty easily when I‚Äôm in public. I am pretty irritable and probably need to work on understanding others and feeling empathy for those whom I‚Äôm not close to. I‚Äôm more of a follower than a leader. I love debates but dislike conflict when it involves me directly. I consider myself an observer and feel I can see right through people. I have a realist point of view on the world and rather than dreaming about life, I think about the current realities of things. I have a lot of anxiety and struggle with social events when it involves groups of people I‚Äôm not familiar with. I hate jobs where I have to put on a smile and pretend to care about selling things to others. Jobs I‚Äôve thrived in are ones where I‚Äôve either been behind the scenes helping people or not interacting with the public in general. But I do best when I know there I‚Äôm helping in some aspect and not just doing the job to profit a company ex: retail. I am in no way technical in the aspect of computers, math and struggle in the sciences but am most drawn to biology/anatomy, sciences, forensics, psychology and criminal justice courses. I am pretty vulgar with words and have dark humor but am reserved in public. Me at my worst involves high anxiety, obsessive behavior (past eating disorder), paranoia (distrust), has a hard time letting anyone get close to me, constantly distracted. Me at my best involves, organization, focus, showing those I care for that I love them through acts of kindness, prioritizing my mental and physical health, sticking to my goals. I consider myself a HSP. 

This is honestly kind of everywhere but I‚Äôm not sure what to really write about myself or if any of this is relevant. Let me know if any information is needed.",1586585687

So far, i think it makes TeFi start mimicking Fe. Fe getting dopamine by helping others frequently, while TeFi gets the hit by getting a job done. 

With SiNe it makes NiSe enjoy a bunch of SiNe‚Äôs multiple life stories. NiTeSe gets to pick out life lessons of what to do/not to do. 

Fe also smothers TeFi. With one good outcome being child Fi gets reigned in and matured, but with Te not having much to do with Fe‚Äôs want/need to do things. (Mom thought it was better to do things herself, and just let little me play.)

I never get to tell you this because our conversations never get serious enough, and compliments make you uncomfortable, so I‚Äôll write it here -

Thank you for always letting me call you about anything. Thank you listening to me talk about all the details in my stories, while remembering even the smallest random things of what I tell you. You never cease to amaze me with your memory. 

We dated casually for a month but I couldn‚Äôt read you, I got scared by your quietness (thought you lost interest in me) and I said we should just be friends. You agreed but told me you still liked me, even though you ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt be in a relationship right now‚Äù. It left me confused, and ultimately, sad - but I respected it.

Three months passed, and yet here we are, in this weird, ‚ÄúI like you but can‚Äôt date you‚Äù era.

Listen - I love the way you look at me, how attentive you are around me, how protective you are over me when I tell you about some recent risks I took. I asked you a few weeks ago if you still liked me, and you hesitated, before telling me ‚Äúyou know, I don‚Äôt like ANYBODY right now‚Äù, as if to say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not ready, but it‚Äôs not because of another girl‚Äù. 

You tell me you don‚Äôt like me, but then on our phone calls you always ask me an infinite amount of questions about my life, my friends, my mom, my work, how I‚Äôm feeling that day, what I did, what‚Äôs going on, etc. And when I end up talking for a really long time, I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äòm annoying you but then you tell me ‚Äúno, your stories are so entertaining, keep them coming‚Äù. 

If I don‚Äôt call you that day you always eventually text me that day or the next, how I‚Äôm doing, or if I ever finished moving, or something else, referencing something I recently told you. 

I‚Äôve never met a guy more confusing, strange, attentive, shy, kind, hilarious, and charming. You‚Äôre so funny you don‚Äôt even have to try, and I‚Äôm cracking up at your weird, super unexpected sense of humor. 

You so apparently still care about me and I care about you too. I‚Äôve accepted we‚Äôre probably never going to date because of basic compatibility issues between us, but god, I‚Äôm so glad I met you. 

I don‚Äôt know how long this is gonna last or how you‚Äôre gonna feel when I start dating someone else (to try and forget you, mostly), but you‚Äôll never know how grateful I am that you care so much for me, even if you won‚Äôt admit it to me in words - you do so much for me everyday that you don‚Äôt even have to say it. 

In another life I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôd be together but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll be this one, and that‚Äôs ok. I want you to find a more patient, kind girl who‚Äôd understand you and fit you better than I ever could. That being said, if you ever need me, I‚Äôll be there in a heartbeat, even though I can‚Äôt imagine you ever reaching out to me for help - because it‚Äôs always you, that‚Äôs helping.

isfj,"I tested myself on 16Personalities and got INFP. I did the test again to make sure, and I got the same result. Then I wandered off to some other tests and identified as so many different types, until I got ISFJ two times. 
     
So I researched ISFJ, and while I don‚Äôt have complete comprehension of cognitive functions, I can sort of understand them. However, I‚Äôm still confused. Am I an INFP or ISFJ?

So, I‚Äôm 16 right now, and I‚Äôve always been a daydreamer. I‚Äôve always created an imaginary world inside my head, but solely for the fun of it, and didn‚Äôt take them too seriously, and nor did I see them as realistic or things I would actually do. And the reason I was instantly relating myself to ISFJ is because they dwell on the past, and applying what they learned to the present. I always do that. The past is a vivid place I revisit often and get all nostalgic about, and sometimes even feel as though I relive them. 

Whenever I have an opinion or a thought, I instantly want to share it with the world. And while I do sort of hold back on all of my thoughts with sensitive topics, I generally feel comfortable with those close to me and won‚Äôt hesitate to voice my opinion. I also tend to focus a lot on what people think of me, and sometimes even become scared and insecure about whether someone truly likes me or not. 

The most confusing thing is that ISFJs are more present-based, while INFPs are more future-based... How about both? I generally overthink both. I overthink what happened in the past, and relate that to what could happen in the future.

Please help me guys! I‚Äôm going crazy lol",1586040244
isfj,"\- When I first met her, I liked her a lot because she was a warm person. She was friendly and talks in an enthusiastic way like wishing people good luck, telling them not to worry, using a lot of exclamations marks and emojis when texting.

\- She dyes her hair a lot of different colors like purple and silver. She doesn't doll up much but still wears makeup on a regular basis and gets her nails done. 

\- She likes skateboarding and dancing, but doesn't go out much. She doesn't like having many friends or hanging out. She also doesn't participate in classes even when it affects her grades and isn't that comfortable with strangers. She always picks to sit facing away from people.

\- Although she's uncomfortable with strangers, she loves receiving male attention from guys she knows better. She brags about how nicely her guy friends treat her all the time. She brags about other things like grades too, but she mostly talks about guys and herself. She posts stories on social media bragging about all the things guys do for her, when guys compliment her, when she gets random DMs, etc.

\- She isn't confrontational and dislikes engaging in drama. I believe drama is her biggest pet peeves because she also stereotypes a lot of girls to be full of drama, so she barely has any girl friends. 

\- She used to enjoy gossiping, but her friend called her out on gossiping, which led to an ended friendship. After this, she stopped gossiping about people.

\- She takes advantage of people without being aware of it. She's constantly asking everyone for the tiniest favors even when she doesn't know the person well. I have a mutual friend who holds a grudge against her because the only time she contacts the mutual is for favors.

\- She does work very first minute and rushes everything like getting home or buying school supplies. She rushes through assignments quickly so that she can just get them over with. She doesn't care for perfection and often would just copy others' work without checking it, but she still wants good grades. Her best subject in school is English and she has gotten praised by teachers for her writing skills.

\- She's a negative person who always feel stressed and anxious. When she feels this way, she needs to vent to someone otherwise her mood will only continue getting worse. She has vented to an uber driver, cried to a mutual on the phone, and people have told her that she needs to change her mindset. She gets stressed by school and relationship problems. I believe she's pretty open because she told details about her personal life problems to a temporary coworker.

\- She can't make decisions on her own and needs the opinion and advice of others before making up her mind. She would spend hours brainstorming her choices with a typed up documents that's organized before settling on a final decision. When she's deciding, she goes back and forth many times and gets anxiety about making the wrong choice.

\- She adjusts her behavior depending on who she's with. She acts more friendly and filtered with me, but more sassy and ghetto with some other guy friends. 

\- She isn't very self aware when it comes to her flaws. She doesn't think anything she did wrong in her ended friendships and puts the blame entirely on the other person. She also said she's a great friend and too caring of a person even though some people think she's selfish and self absorbed. For example, whenever we text the conversation is centered around herself and the second I switch the topic to myself, she would ignore the text. 

\- She complained about her ex being too clingy and jealous, but didn't have much of a problem constantly facetiming him during class, so I don't think she needs much alone time or privacy. In their relationship, I think they were both the cause of the breakup because he was overly jealous and possessive, but she also didn't make things any better because she did things like go to prom with another guy and always hangs out with guys.",1585990048
isfj,"I have a friend that I go out with every so often, but nothing happens until I initiate.

She just responds. 

I initiate the text messages, she responds, we have a great conversation; same with calls. But 18/20 times I have to start. She seems to have a hard time speaking up for her most basic of needs. Even when she's in need of something, I have to 'read her' and then bring it up. Everything is great once I initiate, but nothing really happens till I do. When we want to go out, I have to initiate, she seems to not like making decisions about where we go, eat, etc (granted I pay 100% of the expenses 100% of the time), but its been like that for years now and there's no reason for her to be shy still..... is there?

I would bring this up, but she's under a lot of pressure from work and family life (she's not married)-- I would think that insensitive of me. But at the same time, when I try to cheer her up (recently), she would barely respond (she might use 1 or 2 emojis that would encapsulate what a sentence or two would say). 

I feel as if I should 'get a clue' that she doesn't want to hang out anymore, but at the same time I know that such is not the case.

&amp;#x200B;

* We are just friends. We hoped to be something more, but realized that it wouldn't last so we didn't go that route (She admitted that my Ni is off the charts, and sometimes it's hard for her to ...keep up ......some how).",1585980437

isfj,"(Note: I am not bashing E\_\_J types! Anything I say in this post is just my own experience with the ones I know, but believe me, I could roast us ISFJs way harder! Lol)

I'm able to get along with the vast majority of people in the world even if I don't like them, because it takes quite a bit to irritate me enough that I want to stir the pot. I mean, you guys know how that is.

But I've noticed that I struggle with most E\_\_J types. I have a small sample to go off for just myself, so I'm wondering if you guys have had similar experiences.

There are two ESTJs in my life that give me this skin-crawling feeling of WTF when I'm talking to them because I'm not able to give them the information that they need and they just keep talking and talking and talking and talking and talking and talking while I'm like.. twitching inside waiting on a chance to correct them on the 500 incorrect assumptions they've just made. I think this is my least compatible type overall.

Then there's ENTJs.... Again I don't want to generalize, but the limited experience I've had has shown these people to be very obsessed with arguing. I love a good debate, but they seem to take every little thing so seriously and will argue with you about things you didn't even mean, picking apart your words. They seem to delight in pointing out ways that others are wrong, rather than debating for the sake of enjoying the experience of learning.

Lastly I know one ENFJ who is in my family and is just very contrarian, seemingly unable to comprehend others' points of view and extremely not self aware.

Ultimately, I know everyone is different and I wouldn't judge someone by their type; this is just what I've observed so far, and it's natural that each type will get along more or less with certain other types. I'd be really interested to hear if any of you have felt similarly!",1585942113

This role can change my path in life. It's a show with famous stars and I already feel anxious about being around them. I'm happy but mostly pessimistic about passing the test. 

Isfjs generally aren't very interested in being in the spotlight but who wouldn't really like the idea? (my entj mom became 10 times more excited than me when she heard the news)

**Top 3 Strengths of ISFJs (22 participants):**

&amp;nbsp;

**1. Empathizer**:

Empathizers are great at noticing how others feel and using this understanding to do something good. They are frustrated when asked to disregard feelings and emotions and follow strict logic instead.

&amp;nbsp;

**2. Deliverer:**

Deliverers follow through on their commitments and they enjoy seeing how it builds more trust and respect among others. They feel horrible if promises get broken - both on the receiving and on the giving side. 

&amp;nbsp;

**3. Time Keeper:**

Nothing excites Time Keeper more than meeting the deadline. They enjoy setting up processes, timelines, and plans. Time Keepers get confused in chaos where neither outcomes nor ways to achieve them are clear.",1585634838
isfj,"Hello dear isfjs, I am a female entj wondering about isfjs and their careness.

I have met a male isfj at a conference in the country I currently live in. We got along well and I could clearly see he is making everyone in the group comfortable, caring for eyeryone's needs and feelings, hugging a lot.

We live 3000 kilometers apart but are originally from the same country. When he left home, we continued texting. Over the course of months we would text, voice and have phone calls quite intensively. He would send a lot of pictures from daily occurrences (food, flowers, family), selfies and be very goofy on the phone. He often told me that he would like and was eager to visit me for some time. He repeated that few times so finally I would ask when, but he found excuses (money, things at home...). So I took myself a heart and asked what he thinks and feels about the situation. He said that he feels that there is something between us but he doesn't want to follow his feelings because he is afraid of a long-distance.

I wonder why he would reassure over and over that we would see each other, writing long messages about how it would be like while knowing from the beginning, he does not want to pursue a relationship with me.

To me this comes over as pretty egoistic, not caring about me getting attached to him and the wish to see each other. I feel very hurt and think it was obvious that it would hurt me when he tells me the truth. He still wants us to continue with the intensity of the communication, saying he did not decide yet. This again would hurt me very much. I feel that he distracted himself from his problems at home by getting reassured from my entj cheerleading and wants to pamper his ego.

My question would be: Are isfjs really that caring? Is it possible that isfjs hurt others for the sake of their own comfort?

I would love some thoughts on my analysis (:",1585590374
isfj,"As the defenders/protectors most isfj‚Äôs I‚Äôd say relate to being selfless, maybe to a fault? One of the biggest criticisms I‚Äôve seen of isfjs is that we don‚Äôt take time for ourselves so we get worn out easily (and in my experience being a worn out defenders leads to some very unhealthy traits). Anyway, I‚Äôve started taking more time for myself recently and going out less to feel more comfortable, that kind of stuff. But in turn, it‚Äôs made me feel quite selfish. I know it‚Äôs good to be selfish sometimes, but because of my wanting to be helpful I often feel guilty for letting myself relax.

It was a very surreal feeling for me because he asked me to stay after sex. Asked if he would have a chance if he asked me out. I flat out said no about going out. I did end up staying. We had more sex. Watched Netflix. Ate lunch together. Then he drove me back home. I asked him if we should just block each other now but he said no. 

The thing is it has been a week after that but he hasn‚Äôt sent me any text. (Apart from the first day after the sex). So I‚Äôm kinda wondering if I can still text him and ask if he wanna maybe do the casual sex again?

From what I try to search online, isfj is not really into casual sex? So was that it? Is him not texting me his way of telling he doesn‚Äôt want anything to do with me anymore?

**For example**:  
I am Enfp and I like XXXX, XXXX and XXXX the most

Apologies for the tangent , but you guys remind me of deers. She seems to really appreciate the beauty in things she enjoys , and looks for quality , she seems to return to familiar things quite often- but I've noticed that  that is HER version of self care , and to respect that . Deers seem to be quite peaceful creatures , and though it takes a couple of years for me to actually find comfort to text people regularly,  I've found that even though I've known her for 4.5 months , its become a comforting pattern / routine to text her about my day and ask her about hers.

When we talk as a group she'll often just start looking at her phone and then interrupt me while I'm telling a story to show us photos on her bunny cam. I often check in on her to make sure she's doing ok (she suffers from severe depression and anxiety) but she never once checks in on me. Its hurt my feelings so much again and again and again. I've broken down crying multiple times because of some things she's done.

If someone says something rude or offensive, I try my best to think of reasons why that person would say that, and I really really want to work the argument out in a civil way. Either by trying to make the other person see something new, learning something new myself or just agreeing to disagree.

It just takes sooo much energy trying to be diplomatic all the time and keeping my own emotions from taking over. It just feels unfair sometimes when I have to handle immature people who just don't care, and I'm putting more energy into it than I actually have to spare and I'm getting nothing out of it.

isfj,"So working from home can be a very interesting experience. There are countless distractions and it can pretty hard to get in the headspace to actually do the work

During this time that we are all social distancing and working from home, everything that is happening in the world can make it tough to focus. I just kept finding it hard to even start the work that I was supposed to and ultimately ended up procrastinating for far too long.

So I tried using the classic Pomodoro Technique. Some of you may know this, but its principles of using quick bursts of output and regular intervals were exactly what I needed given the environment that many of us are working in.

My simple process was

* Choose a task
* Set the Pomodoro to 25 minutes
* Work on the task until the Pomodoro rings
* When the timer rings, take a short break (5 mins)
* After 4 ‚ÄúPomodoros‚Äù, take a longer break (15-30)

This was so so helpful to me and I think that this indefinite time being spent at home can actually be put to good use now.

Just needed some perspective, I‚Äôve been dating my isfj gf for 4 months. And there‚Äôs a couple things that I just observed in our relationship and communication pattern.

a. Doesn‚Äôt make really any initiative at all. Even though she may have a preferences or desires when it comes to planning out anything in our relationship.
: this wears me out cause I use Ne. I love collaboration and new ideas.
b. Does NOT like intentional/tough/deep conversations?
: I view these as very productive and a great way to grow in communication.
d. And third, she freaking cares for people a LOT. Now I love people I‚Äôm social and all but for her relationships seem to be her anchor in life and she can quickly spend time with a friend rather than having us get some quality time together (we don‚Äôt even spend much time together)

Overall, we are great friends and enjoy hanging out but as for me these three things ALWAYS seem to be a barrier for me about her. We talked about this so so much. Although I really really like her. It seems like she just lacks the sheer desire to make a CHANGE (another inferior trait) even when she says she wants to make a change.

isfj,"I can't recall the last time I have ever needed to ask somebody for help. I've always hated the feeling of bothering others and the pressure of figuring things out on the spot, so whever I do something / go anywhere, I always take care to make sure I have everything I need to be self reliant. For instance, If I'm camping, I've packed enough supplies to survive a week of cold rain, a week of severe drought, a forest fire, and two bear attacks. If I'm going to the airport, I've already mapped out where I am parking, where the check in is, where all security gates are (incase one is shutdown), and where my gate is, and I've set no less than 3 alarms in order to wake me up on time to give no less than 3 hours of buffer time in order to take care of unforeseen circumstances. Any events or social type situations I've been to, I've made sure to research for a few hours in order to ensure that I follow any etiquette rules I may not have been aware of. 

I always plan ahead and prep for the worst.

As nice as it is to be as worry free as I can be, I've noticed that its taken a hit on my social life. What I mean is that I often see people around me who aren't prepared in some manner asking others for help taking on what I consider some pretty straightforward tasks or questions. These are often extremely simple things that would be in the category of ""If you had read the first sentence of the syllabus, you would have known."" 

I often times find myself secretly resenting these people if I overhear their conversations, like, in a check in or restaurant scenario, these are the people that are holding up the line and making the employees jobs harder than they need to be. When just out in public, these people are interrupting others on their way to work or spending time with their own friends and families. I hate the idea of being a bother myself, but when I keep looking, these people usually end up having what appears to be pleasant conversations. In fact, a lot of my old college roommates met their partners  in what originated as a call for help.

I don't currently have any friends, but that's for another discussion. I am having trouble meeting people right now, and thinking back to grade school, everybody I became friends with was somebody who I had to work with and rely on. I know us ISFJs are introverts who recharge by ourselves, but I've been out of contact with people for so long that I'm feeling like an overcharged battery that's ready to burst. In addition, with all this coronavirus and social distancing going on, I can't imagine that anybody out there is really willing to start meeting strangers.

isfj,"Jung said that Extroversion is objective and Introversion is subjective.
So that makes Si the subjective aspect of our senses. This would be what our brain tells us is pleasant/comfortable and what is unpleasant/uncomfortable.Therefore, those who lead with Si are motivated by a desire to maximize pleasant sensations and are avoident of things that risk losing these comforts. Being Introverted in nature, Si types are more leaning towards the avoident side of this spectrum. That's why i think they tend to favor establishing routines and traditions.

isfj,"Do you show affection to partners/friends/family easily? 

This is something I have thought about a lot over the past few years, and especially the last few days after my mom called me. Let me explain: 

I hug family and friends when I meet them because they hug. Those who don't open their arms and lean in for any kind of hug won't get one. 
I never tell people: ""I love you"" or ""I care about you"" unless they say it first, like my mom do every single time we talk or meet. I have at least one friend who also say it almost every time. Luckily we don't meet or talk too often. Every single time someone say it it totally weirds me out. 
I understand that some have the need to say it, but I just can't get used to it. 

I can be very affectionate with a partner when it's new, but I don't need to be on top of each other all the time. But for all the practical reasons I prefer staying single and have been for six years. Less heartbreaks as well. 

Even my little one tell me they love me more often than I say it first. Now, they are at that age where sitting still is no longer an option so we are way past the holding them in my arms until they fall asleep. So a hug and/or a kiss when I drop them off in the morning and a little ritual before bedtime which includes a hug and saying ""I love you"". But I realize this and are doing my best to fill their needs of verbal and physical affection of course.",1584011316

isfj,"We've been together for over a year, he's the first person I've ever wanted to be in a serious relationship with. I've been happy being single and independent until I met him. He's the most giving, caring and selfless person I've ever met while keeping to his morals and standards. He's also very funny, sarcastic and creative. Although he's adverse to trying new things at times, afterwards he's glad he tried them. He's my unicorn. If we broke up, I'd go back to being happily single. But I've been happiest with him, we've helped each other grow a lot so far. Except for his aggressive dog, which has been an unresolved issue from day 1. 

The first day he introduced me to his dog, he had me sit on the couch and he brought her (basset hound/pit mix) out from his room and said just don't get up or walk too quickly, or she might bite your feet. Like okkkk, you should have that under control but I'm willing to see past it. That night was fine, but we took it (and his roommates dog) out for a walk the next day. After the walk, I was walking through the doorway to his house and his dog bit me hard on my foot (didn't break skin though and hasn't yet). If that was my dog I would have taken it to the vet and put it to sleep the moment it put teeth on someone and I'm very accepting of dogs, I grew up with Rottweilers and understand dog psychology and how to train them. He told the dog ""No!"" but didn't do anything about it afterwords besides put a muzzle on her while she's around me at his roommate's suggestion. That whole night my bf's dog was going after my feet through the muzzle everytime I touched him (about 4-5 times). I told the dog ""No!"", my bf wasn't really backing me up just stood there. The first time the dog listened to me, the second time I told it no, his dog didn't back down and snarled at me. I told him his dog was snarling at me and he rolled his eyes and got irritated like I was the problem. He also felt bad his dog was wearing a muzzle (obviously a muzzle is inhumane but you also should never give a biting dog an opportunity to bite again) and let it fall off. I could never fully trust my bf after that night because he put me down for having perfectly reasonable and genuine concerns about his pet who has now bitten me multiple times. He told me things like ""She's just biting your feet"", when he didn't understand it could escalate really badly because dogs with behavior problems are unpredictable. Though I asked him to keep us separated until we could pay for training and he was good about that for the most part. 

&amp;#x200B;

About 9 months later I was able to help him pay for a session with a personal trainer. She gave some great advice about the setup of his home and how to make it more stable for his dog and that he should keep the dog out of his room and in the living room on some nights when I am not there and not just when I am there so it wouldn't associate being separated from my bf with me. We were implementing a couple pieces of the advice to start and it was going ok but we got too comfortable. We were standing apart by at least 5 feet and his dog walked past me and nipped my ankle, like it wasn't super hard but the dogs full mouth was around my ankle. My bf did not notice so I told him and was furious obviously, he put the dog away from me and agreed to keep it separated from me until it was trained. I hoped he would take the reins and implement a training schedule himself but that didn't happen. Eventually a couple months later when we were drinking (his true feelings come out then) he asked me if I wanted to pet her (while she was on the leash). I got incensed because it's happened several times that he eventually gets lax about leaving the dog around me and feels bad that she's separated, and that leads to the dog being aggressive towards me/biting me. He says he doesn't blame/resent me for wanting his dog to be properly trained and or/rehomed/euthanized if he cannot be a responsible pet owner. I don't think he wants to blame me for it either but his actions speak otherwise. The dog also went after his roomate's feet at Christmas after giving him a brief hug, and hes in denial about it/minimizes the problem. His roomate has taken the dog out, played with it and given it medicine for years, so the biting is a deeply ingrained problem that cannot be easily fixed. The dog charges at, barks loudly at and intimidates any new person that comes along including potentially going after their feet depending on how close they are to my bf. I am touching him all the time and I'm a consistent target now even when we are not touching. When my bf is not in the house the dog has never bitten me.  

I should not have to put up with the stress of wondering when the next time his dog will bite, if he'll get lax when transferring it to the next room, not watch it and let it bite me again. I have to ask in the morning for him to get me orange juice in the kitchen because the dog is waiting outside and and am not tolerating that anymore. And his resentment towards me for wanting to change and improve his things. I hate having to feel like the unreasonable one for not wanting to be physically attacked as the target of his dog's aggression which is completely ridiculous. Why should I have to feel unsafe in what has been a second home in which my partner is supposed to protect me, my safety, feelings and well being. His friends family and roomates don't tell him the truth so I can see why he sees me as the bad guy. Though admits that he can't train or let go of a ""terrible animal"" and wishes he never got it. He's being selfish in that he puts his emotional attachment to the dog before responsibility and everyone else's safety and well being. We had a falling out and haven't spoken in weeks, we both agreed we need to step away or it will make things worse and talk again when things cool off.  I'm afraid he thinks it's him when it's the stress of the dog ruining what could be an amazing relationship. I've told him pretty much everything in this post and more, but my communication method is obviously not getting though to him. Is there any way that this can be salvaged, that he'll see the light?

The point is that I'm really nervous and I wanted to ask you as fellow ISFJs if you have any advice to handle the nerves properly, or just how you usually handle it.

isfj,"Hi there. I am ( probably)an ISTJ boy,who want  to know his real type. So the thing is I can't understand if I am SI Te or Si Ti.i have heard(objective personality channel on youtube) that there are two varuants of being saviour for ISFJ:Si te and Si Fe. I think I am definitely not an Si FeüòÖ. So, the concrete problem why I can't understand is am I Fi or Fe. Because we are quite similar I want your opinion. So, when I meet someone from my families or strangers, I want them to respect me or pay me attention, I think(for me it is a big problem hate that in myself) can it be territary Fe? Also when I argue I want to left my own opinion, even if I understand my opponent won't understand me. I suppose it is an Fe thing, because I have asked it on r/ISTJ, so some purple said they didn't feel like they need an attention from others. Also about my T:I like to analyze things which happened in the past. And my this I try a little to build a system which will work in the future(Maybe it is Neü§î). Also my friends are the most xNTPs(only two but.. For me it is a lotüòÖ). Also, I do think I trust facts.Only the last time I started to sort some information. Also when I argue with people whom I respect I wanna find a compromise. So, sorting information... I mean, now I try to think about every information I receive(or maybe it only seems to me so). Before my words were ""There is not a sense for people who argue to understand smth to lie:it is stupid"" But now I understood, that people,even one who wants to reach the truth, can be wrong without their wish. Or they are just too naive with their confidence like my ENTP friend(I sometimes think he just wants to feel smarter so that is why he make some things ironical, like it is really ironical and he understands it). So.... A huge text))). Thanks for people who will read the whole text. I am waiting for your answer.",1583434002

isfj,"Though I'm an INTP, I'm also on the spectrum. I sometimes appear more like an INTJ (being notably decisive at times, structured planning, daily routines, intent and strategic focus on hobbies).

&amp;#x200B;

So far, these are the good ideas that I've picked up about dating in general, specifically about dating an ISFJ. ... I should:

&amp;#x200B;

(1) always try to imagine what the other person is feeling; think to myself ""what would I feel in their situation?""

&amp;#x200B;

(2) replace bragging like ""I'm good at \_\_\_\_"", with just sharing interests by saying ""I really enjoy doing \_\_\_\_""

&amp;#x200B;

(3) since INTP's and ISFJ's are both somewhat high in agreeableness (wanting to be at peace with each other and everyone in general), a weekly session of ""communicating: boundaries, expectations, suggestions, appreciations, and mutual victories"" seems like the equivalent of ""free relationship counseling"". And can be a positive way to close communication gaps that can be common when a person in a relationship is on the spectrum (like I am) ... It also creates a safe space to share frustrations, to avoid unpleasant suppression of emotions for either of us, I believe 

&amp;#x200B;

(4) make a ""hobby chart"", where we both write down all our favorite hobbies, passions and interests, with some number between 1 (for barely passions) to 10 (huge passions), all \*without\* knowing what each other are writing ... And then, when we are both done writing them, we can compare our interests, and make a Venn Diagram that illustrates where our interests align to know what activities will be fun for both of us. ... Also, maybe some of her interests don't line up at all with mine -- I can still celebrate her victories and experiences in that area. I can cheer for her success in those areas and make sure that she has time resources to explore those interests; and vice versa in my case, I figure

&amp;#x200B;

(5) ISFJ's tend to be somewhat traditional ... In the beginning of the dating process, she may appreciate me paying for all food we have on the date, as a symbol of decorum ... In general, she may appreciate me opening doors for her, pulling out the chair for her at the dinning table, and me doing other ""gentleman"" type things ... She will likely be positively touched and/or contented by me meeting and connecting with her family, remembering details about her parents and siblings (their names, interests, birthdays), so I'll be sure to be vigilant in that area ... I will also make sure to honor her every holiday/birthday/anniversary date, so that she never feels forgotten

&amp;#x200B;

(6) My Love Languages are: cuddling/caressing, hugging, daily walks outside, making art/music/crafts/any creative content together, and spending quality time (simply being around each other, even doing separate things while in the same room/area) ... I think that these Love Languages are somewhat similar to Love Languages of most ISFJ's. And I'll be sure to check in with her to see what here Love Languages are, and how much so longs for each one (numbering them with a number between 1-10, just like in the ""hobby chart"", will probably work well :)

&amp;#x200B;

... I'm very shy, so I wrote a poem about me being on the spectrum. It's the most fun yet vulnerable article I've ever written about myself; which is good, I think, since I've received positive feedback on it from female friends.

&amp;#x200B;

isfj,"I'll keep this as short as possible but I am hoping to get some advice from some of you on my situation.

I recently got hired into a position for a position at an agency I have been at for the past few years. My boss (isfj) has worked with me (entj) while I was in other departments and we worked well together which is why I accepted the position I am in now. Fast forward 3 months, my boss and I are at ends about pretty much... everything. 

She sold me the job because I was told I would be doing specific job duties along with being able to have a flex schedule and days I work from home. None of that has come to fruition. In addition, she is:

-Constantly self-doubting herself
-Not following through with promises she made
-Having regular breakdowns (including outbursts and breakdowns to include crying in the middle of our meetings)
-Stresses about everything
-Takes everything personal, feelings are hurt on a consistent basis
-Needs reassured and told she is doing a great job on a regular basis
-Passive agressive, consistently trying to make my co-worker feel lesser than 

She has her pros, as well, which is dedication to her job, as a person is nice and tries her hardest at everything she does. He issue is, my co-worker and I feel like we walk on egg shells around her, everything and anything can literally set her off and it becomes a passive aggressive nightmare for the two of us, which includes her being spiteful instead of just addressing the issue and clearing the air.

Not everyone is like me and I know emotions are not my strong suite (honestly, the way she acts makes me extremely uncomfortable to the point where I avoid her at all costs if possible). She also has mentioned having severe insecurities and not feeling as though her personality is accepted by her boss/our director (estj) to which I understand.

Can anyone offer some advice that has maybe gone through this or has dealt with this, on how to approach this situation? I have tried talking with her, being nice, listening to her when she is in need but I am reaching my breaking point and her boss doesn't want to particularly handle it, which a problem for another day. 

Maybe this has nothing to do with mbti and she is just emotionally unstable in which, I need to start looking for another job. Thanks in advance!

TL;DR: need advice on handling insecure, emotional boss.",1583343904
isfj,"I am aware that ISFJs generally find it hard to accept criticism directed at them. But for me, I feel like I‚Äôm really receptive to criticism, under one condition: If he/she admits their own hypocrisy in the said area. For example: let‚Äôs say my mom is impatient but she then goes on and criticises me for being impatient. If she only says: ‚ÄúYou are so impatient and irritating, you should try to be better at it.‚Äù I would definitely reject this and most likely flip out, if on the other hand she phrased it differently and say: ‚ÄúLook I know it‚Äôs hard to improve, I‚Äôm impatient myself, but maybe we should try to be practice patient and understanding‚Äù then I would be receptive and repentant to the point where I feel bad for causing other people discomfort by my action.

With the new year and decade, I wanted to really give my everything to all the things that I wanted to accomplish. But there were so many things that I wanted that I couldn't focus on any of them.

I tried Warren Buffett's 5/25 rule, which essentially required you to list down 25 things that you wanted to accomplish in the foreseeable future. Nothing was off the table.

Next, you have to rank your top 5 in order of importance and circle them. This is super hard because you have to decide what's most meaningful to you.

The 20 remaining items became a list of items to avoid. But the truth is that due to their lesser importance, I realized that they were only taking away my commitment to the things that mattered most to me.

This was so so helpful to me and I think that I may actually have a shot of accomplishing the things I want to now. If you're struggling with this, I really think you should give it a shot.

‚Ä¢ Friend request by Laura Marshall 

‚Ä¢ Quiet by Susan Cain (about introverts) 

‚Ä¢ Dune by Frank Herbert (because I wanted to know what tickles someones brain and this was one of their favorites. will probably be a snore from me, but I'll read it!)

I dislike when people help me unless It is really needed, because when someone out of my family helps me I feel like I am being inconvenient/ I don‚Äôt like to owe someone a favor back. She later discovered that I did the writing by myself.

Not really been doing something that had me in a position to laugh today, but I was sitting outside in the nice weather for a bit and I thought of something (don\`t remember what) that made me laugh just a little. I\`m funny like that. Heh. Joke aside: I do tend to make myself smile or giggle a little almost every day just by thinking of something or saying something funny to someone, usually in a text.

I‚Äôm an ESFP experiment with the connections/relationships between different types. I heard that I might enjoy ISFJ connection so I willing to test that out haha. Preferably female",1582360630
isfj,"I'm a female INTJ and I've been drawn to a male ISFJ. We met online and we later found out we lived in the same country coincidently, just different cities. He asked me to meet him but I rejected as I am a very shy individual. I think that upset him. I was drawn to his charming, warm personality. I found him extremely attractive. I was both emotionally and sexually awakened by him. From the  first day we met, we would constantly message each other back and forth for more than half of our day. We would talk about anything and everything that came into our minds. We were crazily in love. He would usually tell me how I was very different from the other girls lol. I knew where this was heading but I was afraid as I have never been in a relationshio before.

 Now the next part will not be an attempt of me complaining about our intuition/Sensor distinction like other immature INTJs bring to notice. I can use online forums to stimulate my mind with intuitive discussions, I do not necessarily have to find that in a lover. 

Anyhow, I knew the time would come where I have to cut him off because of my studies. I am currently doing my A-levels (British programme.)(A levels would be equivalent to grade 12 and first year and possibly 2nd year of university in the American programme.) So I am avoiding falling for anyone and staying study focused as my parents are planning me to study mechanical engineering at university. So I let him know that by the dumbest way-by blocking him on instagram. I then realised what a dimwitted move I did, I should've communicated it with him. So I unblocked him after few days and let him know that I cannot spend most of my time messaging him and that we have to keep our texts to a minimal and blah blah. After this incident, he stopped messaging me altogether. It's mostly me who texts him first and ask about his well-being and our conversation usually ends there. I'm afraid I lost the connections we had together and his feelings towards me probably has rendered numb after that incident.

I do not expect anything from anyone here, this was just an attempt of me ranting. Thank you for reading through all that. 

Also to add to that, I do think INTJs and ISFJs are compatible. I follow Cs Joseph's compatibility method. ENTPs are the first most compatible with INTJs followed by INTPs then ESFJs then ISFJs.",1582337250

isfj,I saw lots of posts about it while I was in a relationship. Didn't believe it could be that serious. It is. We broke up after a year and a half of trying to get past our differences.,1582319601
isfj,"But oh gosh, lengthy post. Poor you. Stop now if you don\`t need my rants in your life üòâ¬†

As my previous post stated I am very new to this, but reading up on ISFJs I feel so at home and thought I\`d ask all of you as I am just a few days in.¬†

Been going back and forth for many hours out of fear of anyone mentioned recognizing me, but I don\`t care. This is about me, not them.¬†

Background story:¬†

Some years ago my kids dad and I broke it off. The whole relationship was unhealthy from the beginning and we were on and off for 4 years. After we broke it off it didn\`t get healthier. It was a disaster. Even his parents started to butt in and everything got worse. So I thought: I am NEVER getting involved with someone again.¬†

Two years later I tried my hands at Tinder, but decided it wasn\`t for me. Except I found one of my now best friends there. Haha!¬†

So again I decided that I am better off by myself. I\`d rather be a crazy cat lady than have trouble with a man.¬†

This stuck even more after seeing a friends family being torn apart after a divorce (and they were seemingly the real deal!), someone close to me lost their spouse due to illness and it seemed like everyones relationship and marriages fell apart. Making my decision to forever stay alone even stronger. These couple of years was terrible and I had to just shut the world out to survive and keep a stable life for my kid and myself.¬†

Then a little while back I met someone online. Oh crap. It wasn\`t intentional and it hit us both real hard all of a sudden after we both had been shutting of emotionally for quite some time, but we fell in love. It was like nothing I have ever seen, ever heard of, ever felt.¬†

After some time it went sideways due to him shutting off. And this is where I went sideways and I have probably been through most of the not so fun stuff. From blaming myself because if we never met he wouldn\`t be in that bad place, my desperate need to help turned out really bad and not to mention pushy (bad idea, I know), spending a whole lot of time online trying to figure out what to do and how to do it, I have felt and still feel devastated because I am unable to help or even be of support in any way, I\`ve been sad and heartbroken, had a week where I slept a lot at all hours because my brain went on overdrive.¬†

I have apologized and said my goodbyes. It\`s sad, but I also realize that I am going through something here other than just heartbreak that I need to fix.¬†

Now my brain just can\`t get a rest. With everything I do I get sidetracked all the time. Reading a book? I get distracted by something and end up on my phone researching something. Same with watching tv. Making dinner? I think of something while I\`m cooking and research something. Researching something? Get sidetracked and have to research some other thing. ""Oh, but what if..? This and that, bla bla bla"". This even keeps me busy from being sad and cry and that\`s something I know I often do, trying to find a solution to... I don\`t even know anymore, but at this point I\`d rather have a good cry. 

My brain start on overdrive each morning and goes on far beyond bedtime. I am totally unable to stop and rest my brain. Now I am feeling so damn exhausted, but I don\`t know how to stop my brain from spinning in ALL directions.¬†You know those crime web walls? That\`s what the inside of my brain looks like. Overstuffed crime web. 

How do I deal with this? My finances stops me from taking a vacation, but I\`d probably overthink everything no matter where I am anyway. Some vacation. Hah!¬†

Am I mentally unstable in some way? Am I being childish and whiny? Is there anything wrong with me? What the f is going on?¬†

If you\`ve come this far: congrats and I\`m sorry!¬†",1582307525

I\`ll try not to write an essay here, but I wanted to step in and say hi. So hi!

A few months back I was introduced to the 16 personalities for the first time by a new friend. I took the test, read the results and was like ""okay, whatever"".

A few weeks ago I started to read a little more up on it and was a little more interested, a lot of things seemed familiar, but we are also people, right? Not just a type.

I was typed ISFP. Yesterday I decided to take the MBTI test again and the Jungian test today. Both revealed ISFJ and holy cow I have had many ""ooooh"" and ""aaaah"" and ""oh crap"" and so on. And the result of this was be basically getting a real face punch and recognizing some really unhealthy behavior in myself lately. I am really happy I found this so I can now grab myself in the neck and make myself behave. Not only that, but I also see that this can make me learn a little more about myself. Not the best with self insight I guess.

And now I look forward to get to know you all and learn more about the type that makes me feel at home.

isfj,"I know STEM majors are generalized as being xNTxs...but my favorite electrical engineering professors reminded me of a stereotypically healthy ISFJ. He looked and reminded me of a sweet, doting grandfatherly type as well (one of my study buddies called him ""adorable"") - even though he was brilliant enough to give us notoriously rough exams and grade everyone harshly.

This professor knew everyone's names (even if they never talked to him one-on-one), allowed anyone to come into his office whenever they wanted to, held extra office hours before exams, and was willing to stay late (until the night) when holding review sessions for exams.

He was incredibly soft-spoken, mild-mannered, and enjoyed seeing me hang out in his office hours frequently since I was genuinely lost. Whenever anyone asked for his help on a problem, he would spend lots of time making sure we understood everything starting from square one (he would make us go up and write everything on the whiteboard).

After every exam he would send us a long email on the exam's overall results - he would be proud of us if the average was around a C, and express disappointment if it was below a C. In such emails he always insisted everyone could make it if they worked hard. Even when he was ""disappointed"" he still was gentle about it - such disappointment showed he genuinely cared about us and believed in all of us.

I feel like my female friends are easier to be vulnerable with. It's easier to talk to them about sensitive topics.

isfj,"About a year ago, I met an ISFJ online and went out on a first date, where we got into a lot of the heavy talk that people generally don't do on first dates - talking about our past, our families, former relationships, etc. Being an INTJ, this girl was already everything I've always been looking for, and she spend the entire night complimenting my appearance, telling me personal things, etc. Maybe 3.5 hours into our date, she said that she had to leave since her business partner had fallen ill and she needed to go check on things, but she asked me if I could go out with her again the next day. The next day came and she got stuck at work so had to cancel, but asked me if I was available again a couple days later.

Over the course of the next few days, I messaged her but never heard back, then a week later, she messaged me asking how I had been, claimed she never received any of my messages, etc. So, we start talking again and, every time we go to make plans, she would just go silent for a couple days. This happened every weekend (she's usually not available weeknights) for the next couple months. In May of last year, I got fed up and just simply stopped messaging her.

In August, she had posted a pic of some sad boxed mac'n'cheese on her snapchat with the text ""Single Girl Life"" so I messaged her. We reconnected quickly, got caught up on our lives, and admitted we had been stalking each other's snapchat all summer. I tried to get her to come hang out with a few people on Labor Day and she replied ""parents hate me"" and said it was just too much pressure. In the meantime, she starts talking about how she wants me to take spanish classes with her, and some other activities, but every time I ask her when she wants to, she just goes silent again. A couple weeks later, she sent me a text saying that she thinks we want different things - I'm looking for a relationship, while she just wants to work, go to the gym, and spend time with her family. I thanked her for finally telling me and told her that I hope she finds her happiness, but if she changes her mind, she knows where I am.

She knew I was having a surgery done at the end of October, just over a month later and, shortly after I came out of surgery, while I was still recovering from the anesthesia, she started texting me again. I told her that I missed her and was glad to hear from her, we caught up on the past month, and things were good for a while again, but still no in person contact. 

She found out that I was spending Thanksgiving alone and invited me to her mom's house, so I took a shower, got dressed, did my makeup, etc, then asked for the address and she simply didn't acknowledge any of the questions pertinent to spending time together, but did mention that ""the first time she brought a girl home, her parents freaked out."" Shortly after that, I got ghosted for the night. I'm a lesbian and she's bi and had previously told me that ""she usually dates men because they're easier - if they get into an argument, she gives him a bj and it ends there.""

A week or two goes by with minimal contact from her, and I ask her out to dinner. She replies that she can't because she's in Florida and sends a pic - not that she has to tell me, but I didn't even know she was leaving town. I asked her 3 times when she was going to be back and, again, no reply, though she would talk about other things.

On December 16, I sent her a text saying that I was sick of playing this game, that I think she either has feelings for me and doesn't know how to accept them, is just playing games with me, or is seeing someone else and I'm just her backup plan, and that I deserve to be treated better. I basically told her to shit or get off the pot. She didn't reply... I asked her if she was back the day after Christmas and she said she was but didn't answer when I asked her out again. When she didn't reply, I stopped texting.

January 16, I got a text from her with a news story, which I replied to... Then I told her that I felt like she was keeping me on a leash and needed to make up her mind about what she wants. She denied it and I replied with examples of how many times she's ignored me so I gave up, only for 4-6 weeks to go by before she contacts me again... and, once again, silence. Two days later, I notice her okc profile is back up and I sent her a message saying I had seen it, I was hoping we could still work things out and that I need her to tell me what she needs from me, but if I don't hear from her, I have my answer.

Last night, after almost 4 weeks of not hearing from her, she sends me a pic of her nails on snapchat since she was excited that hers match mine. We again have a flurry of messages catching up, but she ignores all of my messages about spending time together, though, even today, she's replied to all of my non-going out questions.

So, now that we've gotten that far, what is going on in her mind and what should I do?

My gut instinct says that she has feelings for me and she doesn't know how to deal with them, maybe in part because of social or maybe even internalized homophobia even though she's had a serious lesbian relationship before, and that I just need to wait for her feelings to settle down... but we're coming up on a year and, every time we go through this cycle, I end up hurt again and, as I'm typing this, I wonder why I even keep letting her do this to me. I've been up front with my feelings and intentions since day one, and maybe that has put some pressure on her too... or maybe I am just her backup plan. I don't know... This is hitting my Fe trickster hard and I feel like I keep misreading everything.

So, ISFJs, I need your advice... what is going through her mind and what should I do? Thanks.",1581633619

She is shy and did not believe in herself enough. We did not get to know each other. The biggest reason was still that she had a stressful job. After that she got relocated within her company. 

At the time I thought she was not into dating. I found out later that she does like me a lot. She has started to take more care of herself, but her new job is somewhat stressful also. It's just that we do not see each other now and she is very intuitive. She expects people to understand her without saying what she feels, nor try to be available. I might be one of those rare persons that she likes and trusts, but I personally feel there is something missing. I have been understanding towards her, but she does not just show herself so that we could talk about things, for example.

She has never been in a relationship and does not show affection that much, despite wanting to date. She likes me, and I don't mind that she is introverted.

isfj,"Hi, I'm an ISTP (18M) and I think I like an ISFJ girl (18) in my class and I couldn't be more confused about her intentions.

To give you some idea of our relationship: We are in the same group of friends (7 people including both of us). We chat everyday when we're home with some pauses (like we skip some days). At school we talk often, but there seems to be a barrier until we actually start talking idk.

Context: I am extremely bad at reading people's intentions or at knowing what others want. Because of that I had a experience with a girl that, although it started well, ended pretty bad. So nowadays I'm much more reserved when I'm with a girl, and people in general.

We first started talking more around her 18th birthday in November. For Christmas, my group and I stayed at a friend's place cuz his parents were on vacation. Until that point I thought for sure she's uninterested, not that I cared much at that time, because I didn't notice any signs, if they were even there. Then we somehow got into a cuddly-snuggly thing idk, I don't remember how actually, but I know she must have taken the step cuz I am reserved as I mentioned. Then, the next morning ( we slept there),my brother (who is from the same group of friends) told me that the ISFJ kinda wanted to do something with me, I'm thinking that probably means making out, as he found this out a couple of days prior from her best friend. Why he didn't tell me earlier, I don't know, it would have been useful.


Nothing happened between Christmas and New year's, but on New year's we got together at our friend's place again to party and this time I made it so we got into that cuddly-snuggly thing. But... that was it. Her best friend was really a pain in the ass at that time cuz she didn't want to end up being alone on New year's Eve ( perspective: there were and still are 2 couples in our group, so there were the 3 of us the majority of the time).


Ok, I just assumed once again that she must not be interested ( keep in mind that at this point I think I already started preffering her, to say the least), and just went on with my life.

We stopped chatting as often and such..


On 8th of this month it was my and my brother's (we're twins) 18th birthday party. Skipping the boring stuff, we were out to smoke, and there were some benches there we sat on when going for a smoke, so I sat, she sat next to me, and she started holding my hand outta nowhere. Side note: we already started drinking by that time and she was, I'm guessing, kinda drunk.


Fast forward to when we haven't been drinking in while, people (not all obviously) were close to sobering up. What surprised me was she kept putting her head on my shoulder which I think is unlike her, because she's really reserved and anxious.


There's not much to say here like I didn't do anything because I think she might have been doing it just idk cuz she was sleepy or even still drunk. So we slept in different rooms.

After that we started chatting like before and talking more at school. I'm really confused cuz I think she might have just wanted some affection. There aren't any signs I know of, so I really don't know how this girl feels. I would very much prefer she told me but I know she won't. I'm also not sure if I should tell her all of this directly cuz I have a chance of losing a pretty good friend ( 2 actually, her best friend too, they're a duo).

Should I have done something at the party? And how should I act now? If it helps I'm kinda cold until we speak and then I smile relatively much, but it's how I act with all my close friends.",1581540488

I feel like I can either never (or take a very long time) to give my full self to any relationship or friendship (even my immediate family) without getting taken advantage of, feeling like they don't care, or being hurt in the process.

Since last year, I noticed that they do not include me in their plans anymore and they‚Äôve built their own inner circles and I feel like excluded. Last birthday, I decided to celebrate it with one of my closest friends, who has the same birth month as me and we ate in a five star hotel and it was me who brought two gift checks for both of us.  After that, we talked and caught up and I noticed that all she wanted to talk about was herself and did not even asked about me given that we haven‚Äôt met for several months. I just thought to myself that she‚Äôs becoming too selfish and full of herself. If you‚Äôre wondering she‚Äôs an INFP. And I also have a feeling that they‚Äôre excluding me because I‚Äôm the only one who‚Äôs in a relationship and they‚Äôre all single. Though my relationship is a long distance one. But anyway, that experience with my INFP friend triggered me to really re-assess and re-evaluate our friendship and I just feel like all these years, all they did was take from me and I am exhausted.

I don‚Äôt want to be friends with them anymore and I feel okay. Though I‚Äôm worried that it‚Äôs possible that I won‚Äôt make new friends anymore, but I feel like I‚Äôm fine with it.

isfj,"I was inspire by own situation that happen recently (posted but deleted) and I wanted to ask a risky question, are you willing share your best relationship (friendships or lovers) and your most challenging relationship. We are Si-Fe so let's use this to look at our relationships and value the people that cross our path whether it ended well or not.

My best relationships outside of my family is made up of five girls (was six but I dropped one for boundaries reason). I am not close to all of them, but the closes girl friends I connect from day one at college in this group are an INFP and an ESFP. Our conversations are always honest, transparent, and open. Whether it is happiness or struggles, I just love how we vibe and we don‚Äôt judge each other. We call each other‚Äôs BS when necessary, but we never discourage or attack their personal values. We ask questions when we‚Äôre unclear. We seek clarity. We laugh at each other‚Äôs embarrass moments and we cry when one of us is suffering. When I am haughty in my thoughts or actions, one of my girls lets me know that it isn‚Äôt right. It is a reminder to stay humble because humility change my heart posture to become a better person. 

My most challenging relationships was a previous friend, an ISFP and ex-friend, ENTP. The ISFP hid every time we had a conflict (and we rarely had any). The ENTP was so confrontational that it was difficult to talk about any issues. I was sensitive and aware of the ISFP's reserved and quiet nature, but I was baffled by her actions - she secretly judges people and puts up her guard towards the people who cares about her the most. It makes me wonder if she has judge me. I was baffled by the ENTP's nature to be so aggressive each time someone questions his motives. As I reflect my relationships with these two people, I understand their background and their defense mechanism in some ways. The ENTP offer his rational opinions of things that I appreciated. He taught me to be direct in my speech and stay open-minded. The ISFP friend taught me to stand firm in my position even if there are oppositions and fashion style. At the end of the day, I know I care about both of them but I also have to take care of my emotional well-being.

I have trouble processing even when the staff of some place is not warm and it leaves me feeling very unpleasant, let alone dealing with closer instances of this well (when dealing with a friend's friend etc.)

isfj,"**TLDR: Even though we broke up a few years ago, why does ISFJ contact me on random, rare occasions? Does ISFJ still ""love"" me? Or do they want me in their life as a friend? Or is this just one of their ""new year's resolutions""?**

Hi! I am new to MBTI, but I find it intriguing and it has helped me a lot on my personal journey of healing and self-growth. I was wondering if any ISFJs could help this INFJ out. I am an over-thinker!

I used to date someone who is an ISFJ. We ended things on mutual terms because I had a lot on my plate and realized I was not mentally ready for a relationship. I only remember the good, fuzzy memories I had with ISFJ. (Even during my later dating experiences after my relationship with ISFJ, I would look back at the caring moments we had together.) I also remember when ISFJ confessed ""I love you."" I told ISFJ that I platonically loved them back because at the time I did not understand what love was to its fullest extent and did not know how to receive ISFJ's love because you guessed it: childhood trauma. ISFJ understood what I meant! To be honest, I am still scared of being loved.

Furthermore, after we broke up, we didn't immediately become friends afterwards. However, we were very civil. I really appreciate ISFJ as a person. You are all such kind, understanding beings. Thank you. Anyway, on the outside, ISFJ is very collected and seems nonchalant all the time, but I knew that ISFJ was healing/maturing a lot because one time during a blue moon, ISFJ decided to take initiative and messaged me out of nowhere! The next few years went similarly like that. We would message each other on the rarest of random occasions; ISFJ usually messaged me around the new year (ex: to share something that reminded one another of each other). Now, more recently, ISFJ messaged me to meet up!

I'll be honest, I am still struggling with grasping the concept of love and accepting it (although, I like to think I have so much readily love to give.) In conclusion, I am wondering why ISFJ decided to keep me (INFJ) in ISFJ's life. I am pretty sure I was ISFJ first romantic relationship even though we were both pretty immature. Is this a sign that ISFJ is ""in love"" with me? Or just wants to be platonic friends?

I do not understand what I did to deserve such warmth despite ISFJ's lack of expressing emotions, hehe. I do understand though, so I am not as bothered as I would have been if I were my younger INFJ self. I'm probably thinking too much about this, so please feel free to drag my head back to Earth. I will blessedly appreciate it!",1581222945

Just wanted to say it‚Äôs sucks (the majority of us guys always have to make the first move, on top of providing the initial spark - we ISFJ are the reactive type and we shine more in keeping that spark going). All the ISFJ guys I know got picked up by the girl; the girl made the first move and she provided that initial spark; he just tagged along. A great question is, those dating or married to a male ISFJ...did he make the first move or did you pick him up? It would be interesting to see what the difference is.

I felt she stop trusting me because our friendship was changing. 

Being an honest friend, I called her out on a few things that I found contradictory. I confronted on her hypocrisy behaviors toward me. I laid out my reasons. Honestly, I felt that she threw me under the bus to protect herself. I was willing to go to the distant for her regarding of our changing friendship but she wasn't.

isfj,"Hi,

A typical ISFJ (22F) here. I have been in a relationship with my INTJ (26M) for almost a year now, and we have been having arguments more frequently than ever. It does result from our difference in personalities and communication styles and I'm very discouraged to continue this relationship.

I have never had any personality and communication problems with my former partners during my college years. These boyfriends accepted the way I showed love and care, and they were all great partners to me. Only thing is, I do not see a future with any of them.

Some context:

Since the start of 2019, I have relocated to my hometown (a conservative Asian environment where being dutiful and selfless is preferable), have been working two jobs and providing some support for the family. I admit that I am very emotionally unstable, a lot of crying and emotional tantrums, because some family members are hospitalized in critical conditions. Combined with zero social life, my self-esteem is at the rock bottom.

I met my INTJ boyfriend in early 2019, and we both thought this was it - two months in and I have been introduced to his family. He liked me for my professional work ethic, caring and compassionate side and I liked him for his independence and logical capabilities. Often times, I find his advice useful and logical even though following so would be going against my true ISFJ nature.

Here comes the issue, there is always something happening in my life. Any problem (minor or major), my first instinct was to find emotional comfort from other people (especially from him), and this drains him out. We had conversations to identify the root of my problems and I was uncooperative because I simply am not capable of sorting out my emotions. Two weeks ago, it hit us both really hard. He said he cannot compromise anymore because he couldn't find a solution to help me with my problems when everything I wanted from him was his attention and care (the way I do for him). He thinks I am creating unnecessary drama and dismisses my emotions as unlogical. We were on the verge of breaking up and would have until I promised him to work on my problems. The key point was, he will not compromise to be with me anymore but I'll have to by fully understanding his perspective and the way he shows love and care for me. I agreed.

The whole process made me realize I was emotional dependent on him the whole time. My happiness comes from external sources, never within, and it's affecting people I love. Now that we have identified this problem, he said he will (and can) provide support if it's for my self development. He stressed that this is his way of showing care. I'm grateful but I'm unsure if I can capable of this massive change.

I'm very self-conflicted right now. I understand that by being with him and taking his advice, I will improve for the better but I'll have to become someone who I am not, for ""growth"". I'd like to seek for professional counselling but at this stage, I cannot afford such services yet. For the time being, I'd like to seek advice my fellow redditers on whether should I follow my emotions or should I become more logical and ""grow"" for the better?

Only here's the problem, he is the worst texter. he never had his read receipts on iMessage on until recently. So now I see that he has read my messages but won't reply to me for hours. He wont reply by the time I have something new to tell him. So maybe by the end of the night, he might reply to a few things in each message. Why did he turn his read receipts on now? It drives me crazy knowing he has left me on read like that. Am I annoying him? 

And sometimes I'll say something cute over text, like how I want to cuddle with him again. But he rarely ever replies to that kind of stuff. Also, He will set plans for us to hang out like way ahead of time. Like last week he planned something for us to do this week and I kind of wanted to hang out before that too, so I THINK I'm dropping signs by asking what he's doing and all that, but this mans just doesn't get it. 
Am I asking for too much from him?

I think I'm being super straightforward when I tell him that I miss him and stuff, but is it too straightforward?
And How explicit do I have to be when hinting that I want to spend time with him?
I don't understand. He is so different than me. I am very spontaneous. Am I seeking more attention than his introverted side is willing to give me?
I know he's very inexperienced so maybe he just doesn't know how to do this, and I am willing to be very patient with him. But does he like me or am I wasting my time?

For reference, we are both 20 and go to the same uni. When I met him in person, I thought we couldn't be any more different... We bonded in the dm's over the same type of music, skating, veganism,",1579619467

We are 5 people working together (3 other guys) and she treats me hot and cold and I'm the only one she does this to. 

A couple of weeks ago I admitted to her that I really liked talking to her and would like to get to know her better. 
Since the time I did that, for the past couple of weeks she has been initiating contact with me and has asked me to help her prepare for her exams which are due in a few months (There are plenty of other people she could have gone to for help). She was also checking up on me when I fell sick. 

She is very nice to me one-on-one but is still hot and cold towards me when we are in a group. Doesn't speak to me as much as she does with the others. But when she's home she texts/calls me asking for help related to her studies.  

Are these signs that she could like me back or am I reading too much into it.

Long story short, a have a friend from a couple years, and we recently got closer.   


I've been suicidal this past week and had to got to the ER due to increased suicide thoughts. She knows about this, and last night when she was out with her friends, she came home and invited me over to keep an eye on me and make sure i dont do anything stupid.   


However, i texted her this morning and she replied. and i replied back. But she didnt respond for about 4 hours, and this concerned me, so i asked her how she was, and she told me she hasnt been this down i a long time.   


She has helped me so much though my dark hours, and obviously i want to be there for here in return.   


So I told her that i understand if she wants to be alone, and to tell me if there's anything i can do to help her. this was literally a minute after she told me she was feeling down.   


She has still not read my text and is not answering at all.   


I'm very concerned about her and i'm worried that maybe my suicidal thoughts has affected her in some ways.   


I'm thinking about driving over there to check on her, but i know unexpected things make her uncomfortable.   


I'm freaking out right now, I don't know if im just projecting my own thoughts or not, but she cannot die. If i lose her at this point. Im lost aswell.   


Please ISFJs, what should i do, how would you like to be approached here?

In the beginning he bought me flowers (and sometimes still does and I love it so much!) but his emotional expressions of affection and care are sometimes quite limited and his emotions seem to be quite low generally. If I am in love or excited, I am all over it. I am just thinking, is this common for ISFJs in the beginning of a relationship or in general?

He wanted to press pause on our relationship because he thinks it will affect our studies greatly. He did not say that he wanted to end things with me entirely. We did not talk for months because i dont want to bother him so much and also to give ourselves time to think. I waited for him to message me (it was so brutal for me to not talk to me.) When we finally get to have the ""talk"", i told him that i want to end things with him because it will be the best for him. He kept on saying that i should decided not just for him but for the both of us. I finally agreed to have a cool off from our relationship. I expected that he wouldnt care anymore for me. 

We go to the same college and we're taking the same program. And this is what makes moving on harder for me. Because i see him everyday and he talks to me at school like nothing happened.

The confusing part is that he never said anything to assure me, and at school, he casually talks to me like nothing happened. Sometimes he does seem to care but most of the times he doesnt. He also ignores my messages sometimes. 

His actions towards me make it harder for me to move on. I dont want to get my hopes up. But i dont want to lose him either.

So skip to the end of the lesson and he confesses that he likes me saying; ‚ÄúSometimes you‚Äôve just got to shoot your shot, I don‚Äôt know who your crush is but I like you‚Äù I‚Äôve clearly liked him for quite a while now.

Next we had lunch and that was fine and stress free. Period 4 we had maths, right so he comes up to me and my friends before maths, then after maths my friends were waiting for me and guess what he is also waiting for me. Right so I walk down to chemistry (period 5) with him. 

Subsequently I‚Äôve been texting him and asked ‚Äúwhat happens now‚Äù kinda thing, but he‚Äôs only responded with ‚ÄúI don't know really, it just kinda goes whichever way you want.‚Äù I‚Äôm indecisive as hell and I‚Äôve never been in this situation before.

I'm an ISFJ, apparently we annoy the shit out of INTJs and we're total opposites


I HATE the type I am and the fact that our relationship ended because we weren't compatible makes me hate it even more

We met in our university, we both had been having a crush on each other for some time and once, it was almost the two of us in the corridor so he approached me and we exchanged numbers (it was a year ago)


We went out for a couple of times and he'd do basic intimate things like holding my hand, stroking and kissing my cheek, teasing me etc, but he was all like let's keep this as a friendship which didn't make sense to me (our first clash), he didn't act like a friend at all and he was showing interest in me, him being that way and then just having a ""friendship"" would make me feel like I'm being played (I didn't know about personality stuff at that point and that INTJs first want to get to know their potential partner well enough before getting official) so to prove he doesn't want to use me or play with me we officially started the relationship after 2 weeks 

He LOVES metal and football and well I like a couple of things on a surface level and that's it. I hated how quiet he was when we were together ( I'd feel bad about myself like I'm not good enough and get anxious) but it was because we had nothing in common (another clash)

We would do ok when we were sharing activities (gaming, watching movies etc)

A lot of times he would come off as insensitive to me and I'd take his criticism personally and he always saw me as immature. 

We didn't have much romance because he was generally emotionally unavailable. (Ok this is from my perspective, he didn't feel the romance from my side either because I was always logically unavailable)


I just read on another thread about a male INTJ getting a divorce from his ISFJ and how she didn't really get her after 30 years of marriage (this breaks my heart), there arent many isfj/intj threads on the internet but like 50% of the ones I've seen are about divorce after long term marriages (it probably usually happens after a long time because the ISFJ is loyal and INTJ is fighting off his logics seeing her loyalty)

He once told me in the nicest way possible that I should read some books (he doesn't believe in personality theories so he just sees my illogical behavior as a lack of knowledge and how my parents raised me not as a brain function) but the thing is I'm an introvert I spend a lot of time reading random things from the internet mostly but I sometimes read books. My enneagram is 6w5 and 5s are knowledge seekers and I partly have that side. It's just my brain functioning that fucks up everything when I want to speak logically and whenever we spoke I could see an invisible face palm from him. (He's a 3w4 btw)

We broke up 2 months ago and I've been struggling to forget him and kept contacting him. Today he told me when two people are not compatible they stop wasting time and end the relationship. (I was thinking ""but what about what they FEEL for each other, you don't think love you feel it"", but I didn't say it to him)

I read some hate threads about ISFJs from INTJs an hour ago and it made me even feel worse.

I'm an agnostic with nihilistic and existential feelings (I'm diagnosed with borderline personality disorder as well). So yeah I don't know if there's a god/fate but in case things aren't accidental, why did god bring an INTJ in my life as a partner just to make me suffer seeing and understanding how incompatible we are and how I'll never have him..????

isfj,"Dear ISFJs, I'm in desperate need of your help and advice.

This will be a rather long post, as I want to give as clear of a picture as possible. TL:DR can be found at the bortom of this post.

So, I'm a 22 year old ENTP who have had a crush on this Isfj for the past 3 years, on and off ofcourse.

We've always knew Who each other was since we attended the same school since elementary school. She has always been a rather shy person who never really drew any attention to her, while I was rather popular in school, class clown, never quiet, always making jokes. I remember that i suspected she had a crush on me way back when we were like 12, but I never followed up on anything as I was older, and had other crushes. We never really even talked, but i knew she was looking at me alot. 

Fast forward 5 years, I'm now 17 and had a destructive breakup with the girl of my dreams. She dumped me out of nowhere over text and never gave a reason why. This left me with very low selfesteem and major trust issues, as I found the relationship to be working out flawlessly. I went into a depression for about 1,5 year. 

Fest forward another 2 years, Im now 19, and had recently got out of my depression, every thing was smoothsailing with me starting a new company, got promoted at my daytime job, and this girl from elementary school adds me on snapchat. I found this rather stranger as my snapchat is not advertised anywhere. 

She starts talking to me, and we go back and forth for a couple weeks, until she ask me if i want to go on a walk with her which i obviously wanted as I was over my ears for her. I develop emotions rather quickly due to my type, aswell as being bipolar.

We keep going on walks about once a week for a 2 months. During this time, i invite her over multiple times, but she always declined. 

This was very confusing to me and shortly after I found out the she was still seeing her ex, even went furniture shopping for his apartment. They broke up 3 months before she contacted me. 

This was a major turnoff for me, and I decided to cut all ties, as every thing pointed to her still having feelings for her ex, and she kept me as a plan b. 

Fast forward another year. We havnt spoken in a year, and she suddenly contacts me again. Knowing she is an introvert, i knew it wasnt easy for her, especially since i was the one cutting ties. 

Out of respect and admiration for her courage, i obviously replied back, and we proceeded with the exact same procedure as the first time we started seeing each other. I though the ex was out of the picture at this point, as I clearly started that i wont be part of her life as long as she was still seeing her ex. 

Oh boy was wrong, she was still seeing her ex on a weekly basis. When I found out, I was furious and basically told her to never contact me again. 

Fast forward to november 2019. ISFJ starts postning alot of depressing stories to her Instagram, and she never posts on story ever. I wanted to check in on her to see how she was holding up and we texted back and forth for about a week. This time I have no feelings for her, but contacted her out of empathy, and stopped texting her.

Another 2 weeks go by, and she contacts me again. We speak for a couple days until I came up with this brilliant idea to tell her that if we are to stay in contact, i expect to start dating her for real, and that the ex has to be out of the picture. Im on The Hunt for the Mother of my future children, and not looking for anything casual or friendship. 

She tells me that he is her absolute best friend (wtf?) and that she is shocked by what i just told her. Understandable might i add. 

However, I saw this as the final nail in the coffin, and decided not to invest anymore time and emotoon for her, since i know i will never accept her being bff with her ex. 

Another few days go by, and she contact me once again. And this is where it gets really confusing for me. We have basically texted back and forth since then. The ex is still in the picture however. But she knows how i feel about it. I have also decided to let ger invite me over this time, if she cares, she will i figure? 

Am i being used here? How should i interpret her behaviour? 

Im also suicidal and have spoken with her about it last week, and today i had to go to the emergency psychiatric ward due to increased suicidal thoughts. 

Knowing myself, i will need stability to recover. I would like the isfj to be there for me, but if she cant be replied on, i rather cut all ties once again, atleast until im not suicidal anymore. 

TL:DR im suicidal and have been talking to an isfj on and off for a couple years. Dont know if i should cut all ties until i recover? 

What would you do in my shoes?

Would you ISFJs ever consider dating someone suicidal? Is that a risk you guys would take?

isfj,"Hello :)

tldr ;
From paralegal dropout to social work, to nutritionist to startup, to coding. I took the same test that labeled me ISFJ-A twice and am wondering if you can help me shed light on something I am not seeing. Just looking for happiness and being of service.

Start:

When I was about to finish high school, I took a career guide quiz  (paid for it, school service) and amongst other things, it said I'd enjoy and be good at paralegals. 

So I apply, got accepted. Really liked the courses and methodology for a semester. I decided to pause and get some work experience (and life experience) for about a year. When I came back, I immediately felt like it wasn't for me. 

I did some research about other programs I could take and social work came up. I felt a strong instinct and made the switch for next session.

My program in social work was 3 years long. I loved it. I love the internships and the courses. I was devouring the courses and digging deeper in my spare time. Even helped create a non-profit and have been involved in the community as a volunteer ever since. The only thing, where I live, unless you work for the government, job stability as a social worker is rare. The career info I read before applying did not mention this :/ Lastly, during my last few months of study, I was doing an internship I adored, yet at the same time, knew I couldn't make a living out of it (well, I could struggle financially and never retire, but I'm not about that life). Also, the emotional side of the work got to be too much for me. The professional distance wasn't something I could conjure when I saw the suffering. 

After about a year or two, I realized I had been reading and studying nutrition as a hobby and could see myself do that. So I took up another course and long story short, after a year of practice, accepted that I'm not a people person when it comes to work. Also took up a more counseling job and didn't enjoy guiding people in their nutrition and health needs.

I like people, in moderation. :/

So switched over to a startup business, long story short, love the mission, not the process.

Finally, during the nutrition to now phase, I had been working on websites and low key learning to code. For fun, for curiosity and for practical use. Due to lack of budget from non profits, I saw this as a fun challenge to volunteer for. I've made the switch to learn coding full time since august. Love it and I can see myself working with social enterprises in nutrition related fields. 

I don't know why it took me so long to find something I enjoy struggling in and serving with. I'm also wondering if this will be it ? Will this be the path with many variations ? 

But I would like to know if you've had holes in the ISJF and if so, how do you blend in self awareness? 

Do you have a line of work that you enjoy most of the processes (the actual doing, not just the results) ? If so, would you say its ""typical"" of the personality ? 

Curious to hear you guys. Happy to have found this community ^_^ Thanks in advance",1578712567
isfj,"Just wanted to pop in and say that I am an INTJ dating an ISFJ and I love him so much. We are in a long term relationship and he is extremely caring, I just find I have to be very careful about not hurting his feelings because he can be quite sensitive and reactionary and read more into what I am saying than what I mean. Generally after such an occurrence, he either bites back in quite a rash way or goes quiet and will not talk about how he feels about the situation unless I press him. We have a great relationship but I do think that it requires two people with strong communication skills and an ability to step away from our naturally stubborn natures. Because by our nature we can be in conflict, our relationship truly makes each other better. I have to take extra care not to walk all over him because he would do anything for me (I can be quite domineering). 


Can you guys relate? Anyone else in or has been in a similar relationship? Any tips? I really want this relationship to stand the test of time.",1578696970
isfj,"So I'm a bit confused with myself and I hope what I write here makes sense to people on here haha...

I've (23 m) been in a relationship with an INFP man and found that I was smothered with affection randomly and all the time, which bothered me a lot because I didn't get much me time and felt I was always on his mind. I ended up breaking up with him after a few months not just solely because of this (it's a complicated story), but because of his lack of confidence and I didn't feel he was ready (and maybe not even me) for a relationship. He was a very kind man though and I loved that about him, but I often felt like I was the one making decisions all the time (though it was something I like doing), when I wish he would take some of that weight (maybe I didn't let him I now wonder?).

I am now in a relationship with an INTJ man (29 m). He is an interesting and captivating individual and radiates confidence. He also has a life plan, which I like. But I feel like I have traded confidence with affection, enthusiasm, playfulness, romance etc. from my previous relationship (which I miss, but not in the full dose I received). I feel like I'm a second priority to him and that leaves me wanting so much more that I'm not getting. It also doesn't help that we have little in common compared to my previous relationship... It's almost as if I need a compromise between these two people.

I have read up on the Myer's Brigg's personalities and most of what I've encountered in these two people has been reflected in this. It has helped me better understand them and myself. However, it doesn't help that I think a lot and possibly have overanalysed my relationships. But I can't say I'm as happy as I could be right now - but I do not expect to be fully content with anyone's personality as I do not believe in finding the perfect man; just the best I can find. I want to be able to improve as well as my partner.

Nonetheless, I do see potential in my current relationship, but I would love some insight or input from anyone about similar or different thoughts on their own relationships? I'm struggling to draw anything conclusive from this and I don't know if I do know or don't know what I really want in a partner...",1578691458
isfj,"My math teacher, he is an IxFJ, and he seems a lot of the times nervous and a little bit clumsy, air-headed and he is eager to please others.
This type of behaviour just drags out my caring side. I want to protect him and make sure he is okay. It is like my Fe is on fire lol. I feel that this is pretty odd to feel towards your teacher, but meh.

And INFPs .. gosh . A lot of them have this helplessness vibes to them, which also lights my caring , almost ""parental"" side on fire. 


In my earlier years this desire to serve and care for others has not been so apparent in me, I have seldom felt it like this before. I don't know why it is coming to the surface now, perhaps it is because of me growing up. (I'm 16)",1578679026

The reason I bring this up is because my (very clearly) ISFJ friend told me that she doesn't ever talk about her feelings and open up about them with anyone other than me and likely a few others. With auxiliary Fe I would think it's more common for ISFJ's to do this. Does introverted sensing make it difficult for you guys to talk about your feelings to others?

isfj,"Hello, first of all I apologize for my English that is not my first language. Then I apologize again for the length of my thread.

I have good reasons to think I use the Si-Ne axis and the Ti-Fe axis. I'll try to explain why through this post and showing some evidences. I'm also pretty sure to be introverted so it rules out the ESFJ and ENTP personnalities. Well, where should I start... let's dive a little in my background. As far as I can remember I always wanted to fit in with people around me. When I was a child I lived in a tiny village with no internet and I spent a lot of my time outside with a small group of friends playing to Pokemon or football (soccer). I wouldn't say I was an intellectual boy. I was pretty average at school and it used to bore me as fuck. I was a turbulent kid in classes and I would never do my homework. I also was the ""class clown"" who enjoyed to make others laugh in order to get some popularity among my classmates. I was afraid to be ignored or even bullied if I showed some strange behaviors. So I adapted myself to the people around me and I used to be very mellow trying hard to be appreciated. I wasn't as bothered than I am now by small talk and discussions without any intellectual pursuits.

I was really cut off from the world and my reality at that time was my only reference of the world. So I thought I ought to be like the others: a very simple man. Then, at my 14 I finally got Internet at home. I started to recluse myself and neglect my relationships that seemed more and more meaningless to me. I was communicating with new people and very interesting ones, not those peasants who were only thinking to girls and other trivial things -but I used to be one of them. Now, when I read my old discussions on Facebook with my old acquaintances I feel ashamed of what I was. I see like a big gap between the child I was and now the 25 years old man I am.

I know it's normal to evolve. But I have the feeling that Internet had a big impact on me because it allowed me to open myself to the world and maybe to meet my intelligence. Internet was my Moon Stone (pokemon reference) that permitted myself to grow up and acquire skills like grammar - in my mother tongue tho I know my English is not really good - or even English comprehension. Before Internet I thought of myself as someone not very intelligent. I used to have a low-esteem of myself. Because I think I was too constrained by my environment. Now that's the contrary. I'll be honest: I think high of myself especially on an intellectual level. Each day I feel overwhelmed by the stupidity from others. I feel like many people lack of logical thinking. So, the question is the following: why did I start to feel bothered by all this trivial things very later in my life? Why as a kid or a teenager was I tolerant of it? I have two theories. The first is as explained above: Internet made me aware of my natural skills because I could use them there. I've always been a Ti-dom. The second one: I well-developed my Ti in my late teens and started to not be bothered as much as before of my Fe expectations. I'm an ISFJ who learned to use Ti. 

So now I have explained all of this it's time to be more specific about functions and why do I think I use them. As you surely noticed by reading my background part I was somehow needy with others. I needed their approval and appreciation. I did many things to get that like being the class clown. I'm also thinking that I could have without be aware of it repressed my natural skills at school in order to not seem too different from others. As a way to protect myself from rejection. But how do I deal with that now? Even if I'm a loner and don't have a lot of acquaintances, I always try to be nice to others and not showing any superiority even if I do have a disdain for some of them: I don't show it and try to treat them as my equals. I always have a fear to hurt someone's feelings. To make them feel uneasy around me because I would use difficult words or odd sentences and so on. So, I have a tendency to chameleonize my character with people. Let's be more specific: I'm talking online with someone who seems to have a pretty poor vocabulary: I won't use difficult words because I don't want him/her thinking I am showing disdain toward him/her. If this person uses specifics emoticons I surprise myself to instinctively use them as well. It's like I always want to make people around me at ease. Like I'm trying to connect to them. Like I need their sympathy even though I don't like them because they bore me. 

I adapt to others and never the contrary. I can see that even on online games: I don't like to taunt my opponents when I'm winning. I always show a lot of respect even if I'm far better. I don't understand the need to be nasty to others. I neither don't like showing joy effusions because I know how uncomfortable it can be to some people. They are perfect strangers to me and and I don't even know how they look but I always remember there is a true human behind the screen with emotions. Even if I'm well-aware I will never meet them IRL I don't like the idea they could be feeling angry at me. 

Sometimes I can even lose a game because I was to nice to my opponent. Example: I like playing soccer games. When I'm winning by one goal and that the game is about to end I just can't keep the ball in my side of the pitch because I know how frustrating it is. Even if I know it's the best solution to get the win. I'm also a very fairplay player and I'm disappointed there is only few players like me. Anyway, no matters what I always try to be nice and respectful. That is why I could see myself using Fe. But yet I can't figure out if it is an auxiliary function or an inferior one. I read on the net that IxTPs may sometimes be really afraid to hurt people. That they have an inner fear to be left by the others. I can relate to that. I'm usually very confident in myself but when I feel low I start to reflect on my life and I see how it can be empty and I feel alone, unloved and so on. I don't strive to create relationships I'm better with myself. So sometimes it's like my Fe is telling me: ""Hey, take care of me please or I will show you how pathetic you are"". It's like I rely too heavily on Ti and Fe blows up time to time.

Like a reminder. Sometimes I'm thinking about my future and it scares the shit out of me. I see my family getting older. I'm the only child and my family is very tiny. I know most of them will be gone in 15-20 years. I fear that day because I know I will be really isolated. I'm really not that interested in making friends or having girlfriend. I don't want children because of my personal beliefs. I know it sounds like I'm whining but I'm well-aware it's my fault and that I'm the only who can make the things getting better. But the paradoxical thing is I don't want to because it would mean to sacrifice many things I don't want to lose like my independance. I need space for myself without having any responsibility. I don't like to depend on someone and vice versa. I don't think family life would suit me because of my interests that are extremely private.

Well, I should stop to digress it's not supposed to be a thread about my life. Now that I've shown Fe evidences I will explain about Ti. I love to dive into complex abstract theories, understand them and add them into my internal framework. Sometimes I need to refine datas I gathered because they don't fit with my own understanding. I like to be precise as much as I can when I'm explaining something. I always try to get the exact word that will explain my thoughts exactly how I represent them in my mind. I tend to struggle sometimes to translate what is in my head into words. That explains why I prefer writing over speaking out loud because I have to think a lot before say something. I don't like people who are overly emotional. They tend to make me feel uncomfortable. I don't get people who always take irrational choices or decisions. Neither I don't like people who use pathos as a way to argue about something. I like true facts and logical ones. I want that things make sense to me in a logical fashion. It's why I'm an atheist and that I have a disliking of people into religion who want to make me believe in God. I don't completely rule out the possibility there could be something that made us but I don't think any of the religions on Earth is right. I know this subject can be quite contentious so I won't write more about this but I thought my opinion about this could be interesting in the process of my typing. Sorry if I harmed one of you with my words. I don't care if you're muslim or a christian as long as you don't try to convert me. 

I always try to make the world sounds logical. I don't believe in supernatural things there is always an explanation that can be found. I have my own opinions about things and I try to not be influenced by the opinions of others. I'm quite suspicious about the ""truths"" that people believe in since I trust my own observations first. 

I can be quite paradoxical here. I often daydream about a life of dangers where each day would be a new one without any rule to follow but in reality I do like my life as is it. My imagination is sufficient to me. I can travel all the day with my mind. 

When I don't have any obligations or duties I struggle to keep a decent life rhythm. I don't mind what hour is it when I'm reading about something I find interesting. So my days are never the same when I'm not working. 

Like Ti-Fe, I struggle to know which function is auxiliary and inferior. I can see both being at different times aux or inf. 

I've never scored ISFJ on internet tests but always INTP or INTJ. But I know that tests are not really helpful. 

I don't know if my post is clear enough to see any hint of what my type could be but I hope you didn't get bored reading this. Anyway I'm grateful if you reading all of this because it was a huge post. 

Take care.",1578602060

isfj,"Hello ISFJ community!! So I know it's already 2020, but I just had a few end of 2019 thoughts I wanted to share (...but not really with people i know irl haha). I hope it's okay I decided to do it here.

Right now I just have thoughts about my growth for 2019. Unlike when I started my 2018, I had a set of goals and resolutions I wanted to keep. 2019 was different. I had \~some\~ goals, yes, but it was very vague and directionless. I started the year panicking and so lost at what the hell I should do. Post-university life does that, so I guess my directionless feeling is nothing out of the ordinary. But it would be unfair to 2019 if I said I didn‚Äôt feel like I accomplished anything because I don‚Äôt have a list to look back on to check how I did. 2019 came with a lot of highs and lows, it came with a lot of plans succeeding and failing, betrayals, hard lessons, adulting questions and adventures, steps toward financial independence, and so on.

To be fair to 2019, even if I didn‚Äôt really have //PLANS// for it, it was a good year in helping me figure things out for myself. I‚Äôm not quite sure where /exactly/ I‚Äôm heading, but I‚Äôm not as lost and afraid as when I started the year. This time around, I am determined to take 2020 HEAD ON and fucking kill it‚Äì and that‚Äôs wiiildly different from when I went into 2019.¬† I think I can really say I like who I am now.

Honestly, I could list a number of things I‚Äôm proud of doing in 2019‚Ä¶ but I dunno, a lot of it feels too abstract? I guess the things I‚Äôm proud of are more personal than educational or professional‚Ä¶ so I can‚Äôt bring myself to be social media loud about it‚Ä¶ I guess it‚Äôs something to do with my need of validation before I broadcast anything. Despite that, I‚Äôm proud of myself for how different I am from start of 2019 me to start of 2020 me. I remember being so paralyzed and crying my heart out to my bf at a weekly basis at the start of the year. I guess if I could go back to past me I‚Äôd tell her to calm the fuck down (lol), trust, and get to work.¬†

I will take 4 things with me to 2020:

1. be consistent
2. be open to opportunities even if they seem ‚Äúout of character‚Äù
3. document and apply whatever I learn
4. keep friends and family close

I know I said I‚Äôd fucking kill 2020, but it‚Äôs really hope for a good year to grow and grow and grow. @/future\_self, if ur reading this, I hope 2020 is as good as what I hope it to be.",1577896371

isfj,"Hello I'm an ISTP and this year I've spent the New Year's Eve by myself. It's not really a problem for me, last year I've spent with my girlfriend and her parents and before that I've spent with friends. I usually spend with friends.
Anyway, my girlfriend is an ISFJ, she is very dedicated to maintaining a good relationship with everybody and she is a hard worker which is something I admire. She is the coldest girl I've ever met though, she is not romantic and can even ruin moments by stressing too much or complaining about things. I usually manage these situations because I'm way more relaxed and don't enter the down spiral with her.
Today I must admit being exceedingly disappointed with her. She knew I was going to spend the New Year's Eve alone and not only she replied 30 minutes later to my message wishing a good new year, she didn't reply she loved me back. She could have shown a bit of empathy and at least call back but didn't either. That message was the only thing I've received this New Year's Eve from her. While I'm very disappointed by this, this kind of matches her past behavior...

Can this be an acceptable ISFJ behavior?

I also understand that the fact I'm alone right now makes me particularly needy for her reply and I'm likely blaming her for the fact I'm likely feeling guilty for not having organized a New Year's Eve with friends.",1577837007

1. Interference of decision making: appearance doesn't last and should not be a factor of our entity's decision making process. For example if I sense a couple war approaching these days, I get pretty, everything would become however I want it to be peacefully.. this approach is too cheesy... appearance should not be used as a shield nor a seductive poison. I'd rather to have a man that loves the messy lazy bitch with blatant words and annoying confidence.

isfj,"Hey! I'm going talk very bluntly so I hope I dont offend anyone. I'm (26) an ESFJ male talking to an ISFJ female (25). I love and appreciate how deeply she connects with me. I could see us moving forward in a relationship but I could also happy with just being friends because obviously she's great. A concern I have is that she is very closed off when it comes to sex. She grew up very sheltered. She wont watch movies with sex scenes or any R-rated stuff for that matter(violence, harsh language). She says she has a very visual memory and will remember the images. Also, she has never had any sexual encounters. I personally dont care at all and will watch whatever and it doesn't bother me. I'm also very open about sex. We havent talked about it much but I have a super high sex drive and also looking to have a pretty spicey sex life with my partner. But I also think these are things that have to be talked about and worked up to over time and with trust. My biggest question is: for all ISFJs out there, if you dont mind talking about it, what is your sex life like? Is there a general aversion to raunchy stuff or is it just this girl in particular because of her background? Are you comfortable trying new things with your partner? For example, I'm literally always dtf with my partner, like anytime. I'm cool with reaching down and getting things going and I'd like to do the same with her. I really enjoy being close and feeling her skin against mine with sensual missionary-type sex but sometimes I also want to throw her on the bed, put my hand around her throat, and take her to pound town. Do you think this rougher type of sex would bother her or make her feel degraded? I know in the end I would just need to talk to her but I am also concerned that it could freak her out maybe? Idk haha. I also understand that sex isnt everything and I could see myself with her but I also know myself and could see myself potentially feeling sexually unsatisfied.

Anyways, please share any thoughts you have! Am I thinking to hard? Are my priorities all wrong? Would she not like that type of sex life? Are ISFJs secretly freaks when they find their life partner? You can tell me I'm being an asshole. I'm open to any thoughts. Thanks!",1577691988

isfj,"Heya! I‚Äôm an INFP guy (18) and I started talking again with this girl (19) who was up a grade at my old High School from me. We had german class together and would work with each other on projects, walk over to Sonic after school some days, and text on occasion. She *rarely* spoke in class.

I normally don‚Äôt really prefer quiet people (sorry if this is like an ISFJ thing), but this girl was a lot different. She wasn‚Äôt quiet because she was shy, she just wouldn‚Äôt talk if she didn‚Äôt need to. When she did talk, perhaps after asking her a question/just starting up a friendly conversation, she spoke with such maturity and kindness, but she was still very reserved in the way she expressed this.

I, on the other hand, LOVE to talk, but I also love to listen. I‚Äôm a very fun person who just likes to make people laugh, but I‚Äôm also oddly mature for my age, (possibly because of my depression), and I know she sees that through my comedy, rather than thinking it makes me immature. I respect her reasons for usually being quiet, and I wouldn‚Äôt call myself much of a ‚Äúrambler,‚Äù but I do just live in a naturally deep state of mind and I like to share some of the more on-topic/welcomed thoughts I‚Äôll get aloud.

I‚Äôve never actually made friends with anyone who is xSxx (just by chance), and I‚Äôm wondering if the difference is just too profound for a proper friendship to work. We‚Äôre getting closer little by little, but the lack of deep talking is really killing me and I wonder if she‚Äôs just too grounded in reality to really bond with my more abstract type thinking.

She‚Äôs also not necessarily predictable, though, which is so refreshing for someone who is an xSxx.

I‚Äôm really just trying to ask: How can I get more words out of this girl? I ask her questions, but it NEVER leads to a proper conversation. (Or maybe it does, but it‚Äôs just not a conversation that I find philosophically challenging?) I don‚Äôt know. Help me out!",1577482939

Im an entp and thus have a very hard time undestanding you guys values etc.

Ill get straight to the point.

There is this istj that I've been talking to on and off for a couple of years.

I have always been the one ending the dating, and the main reason for this is that i fall in love quick, and want to go forward with The relationship, while she has still been hesistant, even though she has always been the one reaching out to me first.

However, we got in contact again early november, and has been talking almost daily since.

Ive have been very honest with my feelings and expectations with her, telling her Im not looking for friendship and that im basically looking for the Mother of my future children (cuz that is literally my mission) and that Ive always seen her a potential candidate.

Bottomline, i basically told her that if we are to keep in touch, im looking to date her, and wish to see het more often, and not just though the phone.

After all this, she see s more distant and will barely anser my texts.

I know you guys appreciate harmony and shit, but I'd rqther have someone tell me straight up if im moving to fast or it a dead end considering my expectations.

What do you guys make of all this? Have i fucked things up?

isfj,"How Does Personality Type Affect Feelings of Loneliness? 

I recently conducted some research on loneliness via a survey, and the responses I got from people blew me away. 

I knew that it was a problem, but I didn‚Äôt realize how MUCH of a problem it was until the survey blew up, got over a thousand responses overnight, and people kept messaging me asking about the results. 

As promised, I‚Äôd like to share the results of the survey for everyone to benefit from. 

Note: on this post I will be sharing the ‚ÄúPersonality Type‚Äù insights from the survey. For the non-personality type insights, read my post in another sub [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeNewFriendsHere/comments/eesy16/results_from_the_survey_about_loneliness_for_a/). 

The goal with the survey was to use the data to determine how big of a problem loneliness really is, and then eventually create a program that aims to ‚Äúcure‚Äù loneliness. 

By ‚Äúcure,‚Äù I mean take someone that struggles with loneliness at 7/10 or higher and bring that down to 3/10 or lower by improving their situation or mental state. 

The survey was quite barebones, but that was intentional. It ended up giving a ton more data than I could‚Äôve predicted. 

Here are the fascinating ‚ÄúPersonality Type vs. Loneliness‚Äù insights uncovered, thanks to all of your help: 

‚ÄúDoes Personality Type affect susceptibility to high feelings of loneliness?‚Äù Yes, it does. 

Why that is, I‚Äôm not exactly sure‚Ä¶ So let me share with you the data, and together we can talk about it. 

The LEAST LONELY personality type on average is the ESTJ, with average feelings of loneliness reported at 4.86/10. 

The MOST LONELY personality type on average is the INFP, with average feelings of loneliness reported at 6.9/10. 

Note that the ESTJ &amp; INFP do not share any similar letters- and each letter compared with each other had consistently different levels of loneliness. 

E‚Äôs average feelings of loneliness is 5.54, whereas I‚Äôs have 6.26. 

S‚Äôs average feelings of loneliness is 5.49, whereas N‚Äôs have 6.27. 
T‚Äôs average feelings of loneliness is 5.74, whereas F‚Äôs have 6.12. 

J‚Äôs average feelings of loneliness is 5.87, whereas P‚Äôs have 6.01. 

This trend held true between all other personality types. For example, the INFJ was the second most lonely personality type, at 6.8 average feelings of loneliness. 

The more INFP letters you have, the more likely you are to feel lonely, and vice versa for the ESTJ letters. 

The top three least lonely personality types are ESTJ (4.86), ESFJ (5), and ESTP (5). 

The top three most lonely personality types are INFP (6.9), INFJ (6.8), and ENFJ (6.54). 

That is all for personality type- for all other insights about this project, review the full report [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeNewFriendsHere/comments/eesy16/results_from_the_survey_about_loneliness_for_a/).

I have an extremely hard time finding any common ground with my great grandma who is a textbook ISFJ. The dynamic between the two of us may not be repairable, but it's worth a shot to see if anything can be done. At the very least, if our relationship cannot be repaired then I would like to get insight in her type so that I can adjust my interactions. 

Reasons why I do not like being around her

1. Ever since I was a child, I have had a vision of going into microbiology. I've explained the story to her more times then I could count, but she still tells me I should be a nurse or a teacher.  She also does not remember me telling the story. Once I tell her that those careers are not my goals, she gets very upset with me. My reasons for going into microbiology have shifted, but my desire has been strong for over 10 years. She then will go on about how selfish I am being to my family for not going into something ""more lucrative"". 
2. I could be in mid-sentence with her and if there are children around, she will literally force me out of my seat and make me be around the children. This really triggers negative feelings for me because the children are extremely loud, I have no idea who they even are (I live far from great grandma), and it is always very unexpected. I understand children can be loud and I have no problem with that, but it is very anxiety provoking to force me to into a new social situation with five little ones since the attention is bound to be on me. I am not really a kid fan, but I would have no problem getting to know the children one by one in a quiet setting. When  I try to explain these feelings to her, she cuts me off and says how I should feel safe around my family and these are my own psychological issues I need help for. (I literally never met these groups of children the times she did it.) 
3. I could be telling a story about my own life and she'll cut me off to talk about something like the different brands of kitchenware. I am sorry, but this is not a conversation I would ask to get into. Things of this nature happened a lot when I was 13 and 14.  She does this to my mother a lot. 
4. My mom and her talk constantly on the phone, which is fine, but the conversations piss me off. My mom will tell her a story about how I ran for student senate and she will be extremely proud.  However, let's say it's great grandma's birthday and I saw her recently... The aforementioned details in 1, 2, 3, and 4 have led me to be on my wits end with her. I will not utter a word when I am in her presence because I am sick of being interrupted, yelled at, talking in circles, and forced into situations. I spend the entire time on my phone. So during the phone calls with my mom, she will say things like ""Honey, you have gone through so much having to raise your autistic daughter. I think she needs to go to a psych ward, she is not OK"" I have never been diagnosed with autism or suspected of ever having it. In university, I have more friends then I could count. She did this about 5 years ago and I have not uttered 50 words to her since.

We went on a nice 6-hour long hike + lunch after the exams. We ate at restaurant, my meal was about $17, which he offered to pay for. I always pay back the cost of my meal when my friends pay for me but he insisted, and asked me to pick up the tab for the next meal.

Context: I've been seeing this ISFJ guy for about 2 months (only 5 dates/hangouts due to work), and we've been texting pretty much everyday about anything and everything. Our dates progressed from a night out to drinks to a full-on day with each other, with me ending up sleeping over his. Cuddles, making out, making love. Our last date was a bit weird since he said he had to leave the next day and wanted to sleep in early that day, and he only hung out for a few hours (lunch, walking around, my place). We haven't confessed any feelings yet, but we've told each other that we like spending time with each other.

I won't be able to see him for a few weeks due to holiday travel/work-schedule clashes but we've sorta made some plans for post that.

I've read the reddit, but as an ISFJ are you friendly and talkative with people you're falling for/seeing, or how do you typically deal with it? Thoughts, please? I'm not sure what to make of all this, as I'm not sure if he's just inherently super nice, or if this is something more?

\- We recently had a text exchange where he asked me about my expectations of the future (general not specific to this situation I think), and we sorta shared that both of us are looking for a life-long partner but he was skeptical that he won't ever find the one. To which I sorta replied that with his a,b,c, qualities and his cute smile he would never have a problem. His reply was more of a 'really appreciate you think of me as such \*heart\* \*hug emoji\*. Should I overanalyze this as a he's hinting to a FWB thing or leave it for now?

\- We've exchanged a few 'i miss yous'  
\- He's complimented me on being charming, cute, a few facial features and so have I

isfj,"What do you do to try to become more conversational? With strangers, being quiet is a given, but I am often very quiet even around close friends and family. It's not that I don't want to talk to them, but sometimes I just like to listen and enjoy their company. I've had several close friends confront me thinking I disliked them or was even afraid of them due to being too quiet around them.

isfj,"so after posting this on different threads, someone answered me that i seem like an isfj, so here i am, asking you for advice. do you agree with that statement? here's my presentation.


‚Ä¢how old are you? what's your gender? give us a general description of yourself

i'm 15 and a female. my favourite subjects are english, korean (optional class that i took), physics, chemistry, maths and history.

‚Ä¢any medical diagnosis?

i have been diagnosed with depression by a professional.

‚Ä¢describe your upbringing

my parents divorced when i was 6 and i moved a lot between two different locations (my grandparents' or our place). my mom is VERY religious (orthodox) and i used to enjoy going to the church but ever since almost 4 years ago i started disliking going to it but it might just be me going through my teenage rebellion. i was a smart quiet child when i was small so i had some structure but not really. i didn't get punished often, but sometimes my dad whipped me with his belt.

‚Ä¢job or career?

i don't have one currently since i'm still a high school student.

‚Ä¢spending a weekend all alone, how would you feel?

i love spending all of my weekends alone and i feel refreshed on monday mornings due to being alone.

‚Ä¢relation with mouvement

i'm not a big fan of sports but i do find myself enjoying swimming classes in school and volleyball (but at a friendly level bcs the sport world is v competitive that's why i dropped volleyball due to being bullied)

‚Ä¢how curious are you?

i love researching stuff and reading random historical or not wikipedia pages (my nickname amongst my friends is wikipedia). whenever i have ideas they aren't that executable bcs they're ones that i'd like to do in the future. i get curious about pretty much everything, i like knowing random information that might help me in class or in a discussion. they're mostly conceptual, i like thinking about different concepts that belong to different fields or just weird ideas belonging to those fields.

‚Ä¢leadership position?

whenever it comes to leading ppl, i like unofficially leading them. i don't like getting blamed if something ever goes wrong. i think it would depend on the field or theme. but i think i'd be pretty chill and start imposing my own ideas if the situation really calls for it.

‚Ä¢coordinated?

i don't know if it counts or something, but i like decorating my school notes and writing revision sheets (which are color coordinated). except that i don't find myself using my hands too much (except that i write stuff both on paper and on my phone).

‚Ä¢artistic?

i'm not that artistic but i have impulsively bought art stuff over the years that i have barely used them. i enjoy art that is mostly from the 18th to 19th century. i do enjoy renaissance quite a bit, but i prefer the impressionism artists (specifically french ones). i just like how the colors are blended together and how it can leave a lasting impression on you, making you feel certain emotions.

‚Ä¢opinion about past present and future? how do you deal with them?

the past is something that can help you with present or future choices but you shouldn't bring back someone's past mistakes in an argument to bring them back down. the present is something that you have to live to advance towards the future and your goals. it should be somewhat enjoyed because every moment that we live isn't going to be lived again (or in the same manner). the future should be looked forward to, even if there are unpredictable events that are going to occur but i think that there is a certain fun in that. as long as you make some things to fall back on, like a safety net, i don't see a problem with it.
i have a mentality that is exactly like what i just said, but oversimplified: the past stays in the past (due to past mistakes), enjoy the present (and think of how your actions might impact your future) and look forward to the future (so i could move out after i finish my studies and live the kind of life that i want).

‚Ä¢helping others

i like helping others when i know that i can efficiently help them. my mindset is something like: if it doesn't cost me anything to be helpful, why not?

‚Ä¢logical consistency

i do think that it is necessary. everything needs to have a logical explanation behind it so it can be properly understood.

‚Ä¢efficiency and effectivity

if you set a goal, you need those two factors to properly achieve it. whenever i work, i usually listen to music, i can't work properly if i don't have any background noise. in my case, even if i try, i always end up working on my school work after 11pm. i can't work during the day.

‚Ä¢controlling others

i don't do it bcs i don't like it and there isn't any reason to do that. but i do it indirectly with my teachers. i'm a teacher's pet and whenever i ask them something, my voice gets softer, more vulnerable. it's mostly to establish a relationship in which they see that i respect them.

‚Ä¢hobbies

when it comes to hobbies i enjoy writing (fanfictions or poetry) and i love being in school. studying (while in school not at home) gives me a feeling of happiness. i also enjoy learning foreign languages. i like them because they're mentally stimulating and i know that they'd help me with stuff in the future.

‚Ä¢learning styles

i don't like quiet environments, i like to have some form of background noise. it feels to weird to only hear my pen, paper and breathing, so i usually listen to music. i don't have a specific playlist for it, i just listen to whatever i feel like listening to. i preffer classes during which you interact a lot with the teacher or your peers. other types include ones with lots of images (graphs or maps showing travelling routes etc) and logic (bcs science).

‚Ä¢strategy

i am fairly good at breaking big projects into more manageable tasks but i also equally improvise. i like mixing both up.

‚Ä¢what's important to you and why

it's important to success in life to later on pursue your hobbies when you have enough money, move out of my parent's place after finishing my studies and working for a few months so i could get by. i can't think of anything else for now.

‚Ä¢aspirations

i aspire to be someone that works as something that can leave something behind in the world after they pass away. after i have enough to live comfortably after retiring, i'd like to become a writer.

‚Ä¢fears

i have a really big fear of heights that i can only conquer whenever i have friends nearby. i also have a fear of my parents dying. who else will guide me in life? if my mother were to die that means that i'd have to go back to my native country.

‚Ä¢highs in your life

becoming fluent in the language of the country that i live in, aceing my classes, spending time with my biological father.

‚Ä¢lows in your life

leaving my native country, the start of my depression (2016), changing schools, not being in any school for about two weeks (legal complications), my parents' divorce.

‚Ä¢attachment to reality

i'm pretty attached to it. i never daydream and i always pay attention to what's going on around me.

‚Ä¢being in an empty blank room

i think about all of the chapters that i'm going to write in my fanfiction and i'll drift away into it and try to hang on the information so i could write it down whenever i get out of the room.

‚Ä¢important decision

it depends on the time that i have to make it but i usually take almost the entire time to think it over once again. i don't think that i'd change my mind after making it.

‚Ä¢process emotions

it does take me some time to process them. i try to shut my emotions down as much as i can, which then results into me bottling it all up and then exploding at one point or another. i used to be a more emotional person but i've been changing (and now am) someone that is more driven by logic. i do this bcs i always fight with my mom whenever i hint at her that i still have depression and she ends up shouting at me and saying that i have absolutely nothing to complain about bcs in her eyes my life is perfect at the moment (but she doesn't know that my biggest depression factor is the fact that i'm still in the closet)

‚Ä¢agreeing with others

i do find myself doing this often bcs i don't want to have a conflict with someone. i'm also repressing my anger whenever someone doesn't listen to my advice. my mother has anger issues and i don't want to let myself get guided by them like her.

‚Ä¢breaking rules

i never break rules, i love doing stuff by the book. the only rule (imposed by my mom) that i break is the one about being heterosexual (which i'm very much not). i wouldn't say exactly that they know better, but it might be for the best of everyone.

‚Ä¢ideal life

one in which my mother accepts my sexuality (bisexual with strong female preference), where i can come with my girlfriend at home without lying about our relationship status. one in which everyone can do the job that they want, without worrying if it's well paid or not. one in which i have enough money to travel the world, and every country being 100% safe (unlike now).

isfj,"Hi guys!

I‚Äôve been having some relationship ups and downs lately and tonight after a conversation, I realized that a lot of those downs probably stem from communication differences and how we both express affection. 

My boyfriend is an ISFJ and I‚Äôm an ENFX. When I care about someone, I‚Äôm very affectionate and I‚Äôm very open about it. I‚Äôm an extrovert and I share my feelings readily and easily, good and bad. I know this can be overwhelming sometimes so I‚Äôve been trying to moderate it to some degree, at least for the less positive emotions. 

My boyfriend is an ISFJ, and I‚Äôve noticed that sometimes he is also very affectionate and sometimes he isn‚Äôt. When things are good, he expresses affection in the same way that I do and it feels great. Other times it seems like he shuts down or turns off all emotion. He also usually gets annoyed with me if I try to talk to him when he‚Äôs like this and when I ask him what‚Äôs wrong, I don‚Äôt get real (extrovert speak for lengthy or long) answers. he usually says nothing or sometimes he‚Äôll say he‚Äôs tired. It causes me a great deal of stress because it feels like the lack of affection is somehow my fault or that I‚Äôve made him mad somehow. Sometimes I worry too that he doesn‚Äôt have feelings for me anymore. 

Can any ISFJs give some advice? I‚Äôm mostly worried about how I can tell whether or not he actually has feelings for me because sometimes I question it, especially when he‚Äôs silent and moody for prolonged times. 

I‚Äôd also welcome a discussion on how ISFJs tend to show affection or why/how these ‚Äúsilent episodes‚Äù happen, and what extroverts should and shouldn‚Äôt do during them.",1576626350

I am in no way spiritual.

I don't really care genuinely for society or people in general. I care deeply for only the ones I really love.

I'm not clingy. I was only ever extra affectionate in my previous relationship, but took my distance really quickly if I noticed I was a bit much. I hate feeling like I am annoyingly clingy. 

I don't like sudden change, but I can handle it and adapt well enough. 

I would never work with anything involving caring for other people at all.

isfj,"I‚Äôm a girl, and an ENFJ. She‚Äôs an ISFJ, and we have been getting closer this year. 
im a senior at high school and she‚Äôs one year younger,, our friendship started out of blue, almost 8 months ago, I don‚Äôt know much about her,, yes , we talk but not that frequently. To clear things up, we are both straight, but i can say i do like her a lot, more than anyone in school,, (she has a boyfriend, if that matters)

today she was running and playing something with others where the floor was wet due to raining, and she wasn‚Äôt wearing proper shoes,, later, i went to hug her, and while she was in my embrace, i told her ‚Äúdon‚Äôt you know that you may fall when you run like that on wet floors?‚Äù And she said: ‚Äúand my shoes weren‚Äôt  appropriate‚Äù almost playfully ,, and i said: ‚Äúwhat should i do with you? why don‚Äôt you care about yourself‚Äù and she said

I find that I can easily understand Fi and how it comes to it‚Äôs conclusions. I definitely can understand the need for individuality and personal values.

**Tl;dr** What differs you from high Ne types esp. if you do value both SiNe, and esp. if you're an enneatype 6wX?

---

**Context**:

*I (late 20s/F) am pretty sure about having Ne but I use it imho intensively both in a positive and [negative](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/e59lo3/what_fntype_is_correlated_to_using_past/) way (if experiecing extreme stress / going fully irrational). If I am an ISFJ, then likely an enneatype 6w(7) (highly phobic/fearful but also energized/excited by new situations/changes even if they scare me a sh-tton) 'cuz of the way I experience fear / anxiety attacks (shitton of them lol, I thank living with a highly phobic/OCDish/irrational/over-protective ISTJ parent) but I also strongly relate to 3 and 7 (I have a huge desire to idk, contribute / accomplish something and be recognized for it and I also have an irrational fear of tying myself to something (a job, responsibility) because I always think about some fancy ""I cannot let go of this future temporary opportunity and these shifts stand in my way (fav volunteering job, sudden idea to do other things, w/e)"".*

*The types are to be ignored tho, I am not well read in enneagram. My old community-(mis)type is an INTP but I see myself too Fe'ish for an INTP, too void-of-values for INFP, too Si'ish for ENXP, too Ne'ish for an ISFJ.

I'm pretty sure that sometimes I'll feel anxious or sad or depressed or some other negative emotion, but not notice it until it turns into physical symptoms (headache, fatigue, upset stomach, etc). This has actually led to a lot of health anxiety for me because half the time I can't figure out where these symptoms are coming from, even though I know they are most likely the result of my feelings.

A few days ago, I got a job offer and I don't know how I feel about it. I want to be excited. It's a step up from anything I've done before, more suited to my interests, and I'm glad that I'm going to be making money again after a few months of doing nothing. But I don't actually *feel* anything about it. Not excitement. Not worry. Nothing. All I know is that I've felt sluggish and somehow just ""off"" ever since my interview, despite having no real signs of illness, and I think I probably have some deeply hidden anxiety about working again and I just can't figure out exactly where it's coming from.

isfj,"Folks,

Just wanted some relationship advice on how to take this forward or if I'm overthinking this. Here's some context:

Met an ISFJ guy on a dating app a month back, we immediately hit off, talked for a full week before we met. Talked for quite a bit, and hooked up. Felt I really connected with the guy, and we kinda met again a few times.

1. First time: My hotel room - talking and hooked-up (he asked me out)
2. Second time: Drinks, my hotel room, tv shows, cuddling, holding hands, hooking up (I asked him out)
3. Third time: Dinner, walking on the beach, tv shows, cuddling, holding hands, hooking up, i slept over at his place - woke up around midnight to him putting a blanket on me as I ran out of it on my side (he asked me out and proposed activities)
4. Fourth time (not yet): He suggested we should meet the coming week pending some scheduling. A full day date: went shopping, lunch, watched a movie at a cinema (this was kinda awkward), went back to his place, hooked up, had dinner, played some board games, I slept over and he cuddled in my arms, had breakfast, and left around noon

We've been texting everyday, sharing random things, asking about each others' day etc. Talking about mundane things, he's sharing pics of random things he's doing now and then, getting to know each other's lives, but I'm not entirely sure where this is headed. His texts are full of random events of the day, asking questions about me, sharing his past, but then he also responds after an hour or so (or more sometimes), even though he is online at times. But whenever we meet, its non-stop talking, cuddling, kissing, and deep hugs etc. Not sure what to make of this and why i'm overthinking this - kinda developing feelings for the guy. He is super sweet, and we have quite a lot in common.

A few things that make me think he likes me:  
\- All of the above  
\- He sends me random pics here and there, of what he is doing, his plans for the day, random things  
\- Our last date basically had everything - he had saved a memento of our 3rd date (i forgot a gift card at his place and told him to keep it), he asked me to sleep over, he made the EXACT move i had thought of but was too scared to do it - to kiss him as soon as we made back to his place 

A few things that confuse me:  
\+ He still seems to be on dating apps   
\+ The last time I was leaving his place, at first we hugged,made out, he put his head on my shoulders. But when I was leaving for the door (2 mins later), he kinda gave me a distant side-hug and made some small talk and didn't exactly look at me. He had to leave for the bus stop 40-50 mins later but kinda felt weird.

Any suggestions on:

1. How do you ISFJs deal with such a situation - do you showcase emotion like this? Should i try and push it forward or take it slow? 
2. Any suggestions on how to figure out if this is a FWB thing, or maybe something more serious?
3. Any markers/flags in your experience that indicate something is off?",1575310442
isfj,"I met this woman with an INFP personality a while ago. She seemed like a happy person who liked to help others and did well career-wise. She also liked me but was constantly so stressed because of her job that she came across as a cold person and not interested in me. It was the reason we didn't get together. Apparently it's not her first time, because she has spent much of her 20s working and studying. She was raised to be frugal and she did not spend any time on her appearance before she met me.

I'm 26 years old and she is now about 34 years old, still single and young looking. She also likes me a lot and regrets giving me the cold shoulder earlier, now that she knows more about me and that I like her. Her behavior  and looks has also changed lately. She seems more sexually frustrated and deperate, like going through an age crisis. She spends much more time on clothes and appearance than ever before. I no longer feel the same connection to her, as when I first met her. She seemed more happy and content, self-confident back then.

isfj,"Many MBTI enthusiasts on Reddit are aware of C.S. Joseph's [""Four Sides of the Mind"" theory](https://csjoseph.life/what-are-the-four-sides-of-the-mind/). This theory suggests that each MBTI type will predominantly show characteristics of four MBTI personality types (including their main type).

These four personality states are named the ego, subconscious, unconscious, and super ego.

Each personality state is associated with an MBTI type relative to an individual's primary function stack.

This theory suggests that a person will sometimes use their cognitive functions out of their natural order, having the effect of making a person occasionally act contrary to their usual personality. (For example: a person might find himself in a certain mood, causing him to think and act differently, perhaps in a more introverted or extroverted manner than is usual for him.

According to the ISFJ's cognitive stacking, the four sides of their mind are as follows:

Ego: ISFJ (default observable personality)

Unconscious: ESFP

Subconscious: ENTP

Super ego: INTJ

As you can see, the ISFJ has quite a range of thought and expression according to this theory.

What do you think, ISFJ community? Do you find yourself thinking or acting similar to any of these three additional personalities‚Äîand if yes, under what circumstances?

I am particularly interested to know if any of you ISFJs here find yourselves thinking or acting akin to ENTPs from time-to-time, since‚Äîon the surface‚Äîthat personality often looks like your polar opposite.",1575254292

I'm an INTP woman and I have chatted to this nice ISFJ gentleman. I knew he was one since I basically forced him to take the test at initial phase of our friendship to better know how to interact with him. We have never met, though plan to in near future so it's really just a long-distance relationship.

We flirted quite a bit, tho I was really awkward haha. I also knew he was chatting with different girls as well, which he told me honestly. So, I really don't feel that bad about cutting off our relationship since socializing is not my strong forte and it is something I reserve for people who I really, really like to even engage in.

Don't get me wrong. ISFJ are warm and friendly; I really love you guys. Only, I think many ISFJ have trouble cutting off people that do not matter.

Furthermore, I think he's no longer interested in me since our chat had become bland with me being the only one asking him questions. I don't know if this is typical to ISFJ or it's just him tho. Is this a sign? We used to stop chatting for 1 week before he contacted me again. I still reciprocate his message tho I would like to move on now since there's no longer 'spark' between us. I tried to ignore him but the next day he write to me again and I felt sorry LOL.

This is an XNTP with an ISFJ mother, and I'm trying to talk her into attending psychotherapy.

Currently she is experiencing some remorse and worry over the passing away of my father some months back, she needs to be back on track and doing her routine and she knows it too, but the grief of the loss catalyzed the surfacing of years of pent up emotions from having carrying so much baggage and burden in the form of serving the family, being a working mom, and taking care of both household etc all at the same time.

She is able to identify that she feels emotionally and energetically drained and that she feels ""general weakness"" which results in ""tiredness"".

Mental health is still unexplored territory for her and she may even see it as a taboo to need to talk to a therapist.

She is very religious and resorts to prayer and believes that God will show her a way out and I respect her beliefs but she does seem hesitant to take this initial step.

Is there a greater chance for ISFJs to listen to and take advice from senior members of the family more than younger ones.

I guess instead of me talking to her, having some well established authority figure advising might be better.

isfj,"I noticed that a lot of ISFJs happen to be women and you guys are all awesome! Just wanted to throw an appreciation post at all the male ISFJs as well.

My (28F) ISFJ friend (30M) recently reconnected with me during a mutual friend's wedding. I'm just shocked at how being with him is so effortless. We were friends for several years before he moved to another state to pursue his Master's degree. 

4-5 years ago, my ISFJ friend actually confessed his feelings to me. Bad news: so did our INTJ friend. It was poor timing all around and I had to make a decision. I hate stringing people along. He was heartbroken and I was as well. I developed feelings for him too. I knew my ISFJ friend for maybe a year or two prior to this. I had ZERO clue he was into me. 

I always look at my friends with admiration and warmth, but I had a rule not to date friends. I never thought he could be into me. He's intellectual, organized, wicked funny, and kind. I'm scatter-brained, extremely extroverted (at the time), and very silly. When we first met, he was very reserved. I couldn't tell what was going through his head. I just thought we were very different people that I did not consider that he could ever like me. And then we became closer and closer friends. 

After I chose to be with my INTJ boyfriend, ISFJ friend was very sad and I remember crying with him. I was torn up because I really liked him as well. We had a big heart-to-heart together. And we were back to being friends. We talked about it *a lot* and he said that he did NOT blame me at all. I gave him space to process (for myself as well) and we were good. 

Fast forward to beginning of this year (4 yrs later), I helped him pack up for his big move. We're not as close as we used to be in the previous years because of work/school/obligations, but still friends. 

A few months ago, my INTJ boyfriend and I decided to split (we are still best friends). We went to our mutual friend's wedding recently and ISFJ friend was there. He looked handsome and stylish. He said I looked ""stunning"" as a bridesmaid and that I was a knockout. He texted me after the wedding that his feelings hasn't changed in 4 years. Me, being intrigued and also shocked, asked him why. He said that he can't help it. 

There are some communication problems, sure. Like I feel self-conscious asking for what I want, but he said that he prefers it. And is more than happy to give it to me (i.e. having him call me more). I'm very aware that he's an introvert so I try to give him as much space as possible (even if he lives in another state). 

We started texting/calling every other day when he went back to his state. This past week, he's been in town for business and we went on a date together. 
Needless to say, our chemistry is good. It blew me away how happy I felt with him.

I expressed to him my frustration with guys and how I'm the one to always initiate (asking the guy our first/doing anything) before. I noticed that he made a concerted effort to initiate and hold my hand. It was very sweet. 

I love how attentive ISFJ guys are. Definitely underrated. He's very physically affectionate toward me and not in an overbearing/PDA way. It'd be something simple like hugging me from behind in line to go see a movie and kissing the top of my head gently. A hand around my shoulder when we are crossing the street. It's very simple and intimate. 

He is thoughtful, yet somehow...doesn't pick up certain cues well. He takes everything at face value which I admire. He doesn't ascribe malicious intent to things. He's actually very logical. His work ethic is awe-inspiring and he's responsible. When he tells me about work I know he downplays his accomplishments so I try to tell him how much I appreciate his perseverance. 

Correct me if I'm wrong...I feel like ISFJ guys get some flack for being sensitive and emotional but I adore it. The crazy thing is, he does not come off this way at all to people that don't know him too well. I'm starting to realize this too. There's no boasting, no pretense, and no BS. He's very calm and keeps his emotion under wraps. But when someone frustrates him at work, he's direct without being dismissive. That's a huge thing for me. 

He's expressed that he appreciates how open and honest I am. He likes the fact that I can pick up on the slightest cue socially and make everyone in the group feel welcomed. Some of the stuff he's said to me...makes me melt. And NONE of it is corny. That's a major skill in itself. 

Aside from this guy, the ISFJ guys at my work make *everything* run smoothly. They're so good-natured, but I know they get annoyed when people do careless things or are forgetful over simple tasks. They're the ones that do little things like: buy snacks for a fellow pregnant coworker or bring donuts for the entire office.

I know that ENFPs are worlds apart from ISFJs. I feel scared going into this. We might be too different, but we both want to find out. We're not rushing into anything and he plans on moving back after he gets his degree. This ISFJ friend makes me feel safe and secure. I guess it helps that we have a baseline of friendship no matter what. Thanks ISFJ guys out there.",1574369510

isfj,"I've heard that this is sort of an xSFJ stereotype but in my case it's very true. For those of you who believe in astrology, I'm a Virgo which makes this trait even more pronounced.

I'm never mean. I'm very agreeable &amp; soft-spoken, and I make a point to compliment people as often as I can. In even the most heated arguments, I don't say things to hurt the other person, I just make my point. Despite all of this, I can be very judgmental of other people.

I think it's sort of a defense mechanism for me. When I was younger, I would care way too much what people thought about me. If I heard that someone I barely knew said they didn't like me, I would be crushed, especially if I didn't know why. Then as I got older, I started noticing a pattern. The people who tend to dislike me (that I know about) all have a tendency to start fights, neglect their hygiene/appearance, get involved in political extremism, and make other questionable choices. When I realized this, I started developing a sense of superiority. I started to view these types of people as ""bottom of the barrel"" or ""low-tier,"" and that made me stop caring so much.

Now I feel like my politeness is disingenuous and that people can see through it. Even with the people I described starting fights are generally being nasty to everyone, I can't help but notice that they're still more well-liked than I am. An example is that they'll get 15 likes on a social media selfie while I'll usually get 1 or 2. They go places with big groups of friends and I'm not that close with anyone besides my boyfriend. So sometimes I still struggle with insecurity because I feel like I am even below those people socially. I feel like a lot of people I try to make friends with pick up on a ""fake"" or ""trying too hard"" vibe and it  turns them off, and this could be why it's so hard for me to make lasting connections.

Does anyone else here struggle with this? Do I suck for being judgmental or is it a normal thing that everyone does? Are people most likely sensing that I'm highly critical?",1574328454

Right now she's sick. She's always doing things for me and I want to do something for her now since she's not feeling well. Does anyone have advice about what I can do for her that would mean something and be appreciated?

Thanks! :)",1574027258

isfj,"Recently i been typed as an ISFJ but i always thought i was an ISFP.

Here are facts about me that could help clarify if i am an ISFJ, ISFP Or Mabey i m a ESFJ? A really low-key ESFJ?? Thats why i m posting here to see if any ESFJs can relate to the facts. 

* I like familiarity and stability. And at work i m efficent, hard working and do my chourses. 
* i like begin with people i like and avoid people i dont like. But if i ever meet a person i used to dislike in my younger years i would mabey still greet them with an ‚Äùhi‚Äù or if i got eye contact with them i would talk/chat a bit with them. Too see if they has change and to satisfy my own ego (like for exemple at least i was the ‚Äùnice‚Äù one). 
* I dont mind company now and then. Also I dont get absorbed by other people energy easily but i do get tired so i need to go away to be by myself. But i like to spend time with my close friends and with my family and relativites. 
* I know i m not the brightest but i know what i m good at and not good at. Basically i m aware of my strenghts and weaknesses. 
* I m in mostly good mood and wants to talk almost regulay to someone. It could be through texting. I feel i wanna spend time with someone or go along when my family member are going somewhere. I want to do something fun and feel the need to eaither ask if i could tag along or something along those lines. 
* Its hard to insult me, but depending how is insulting me i could eaither go ‚Äùwhy did she/he said that to me‚Äù or ‚Äùwhy should i care of an stranger (if it is a stranger) option of me?‚Äù. 
* I like helping my family members and do what i know i can. 
* When i meet someone new and Depending on what each person is i like to greet them, talk with them (getting to know them) and try to make a first good impression. 
* I been told i m caring, understanding and sympathic. 

Thats was it, pls ask me question that could help clarify my type.",1573974180

isfj,"I've been seeing this woman for a few weeks now. I actually quite like the way she's been coming off to me. She seems to have a strong yet subdued personality and a has a good, practical head on her shoulders. She also has a subtle, comforting aura about her. We've definitely progressed our (currently unlabeled) relationship quite a lot given the fact that I've already been over to her place, we take turns cooking dinner for each other and I've already spent the night. During the work week for her, no less.

isfj,Hi everyone! I'm an ISFJ(F) and I have an INTJ boyfriend. We've been together for a while now. As our relationship progressed I've learned more and more about us being polar opposites since ISFJ's are emotionally driven and INTJ's are very logical and critical. I can see that he is also trying his best to make us work despite our very opposite nature that is why I'm researching on how to come in terms of meet each other half way given that we're really different. Not only that we are different our age Gap is 17 years. That is why it's especially challenging and I've been doing my research and there isn't any ISFJ-INTJ Relationship threads here or if there is it all says that it's hard to make it work or it's close to impossible due to the incompatibility. Maybe you can give me advice or any RL experiences that I can use to improve our relationship. Especially  with how we communicate and our individual love languages.

isfj,"Next year, my ISFJ gf (25) is going to a wedding in Mexico. She invited me (27m) to go as our relationship is very committed, and we are thinking through a future together. I said yes and was delighted that she invited me. The problem is that my family is very traditional and religious and doesn‚Äôt want to us to travel together (We do not care and would love to). My family thinks we are just trying to get away and have sex. My gf is worried my family will find out our secret of traveling together (they are nosy and try to control their children), and my gf is concerned that they will be very mad at her and possibly reject her from the family. She has never had very stable family, but my family is very stable, loving, and close most of the time, and she thinks my family has something special. She wants to be apart of it, but she is worried the trip will ruin her chance at being fully accepted into my family one day. She is very worried I might get sick/hurt on the trip, and she will have to call and tell them which scares he in multiple ways because they won‚Äôt even know I‚Äôm there. I plan to keep it private which is the best way because it is unlike anything will go wrong in my opinion. To be honest, if my family did learn of our trip, they would be upset, disappointed, and they would talk about her. This doesn't bother me, I've learned to live with my family, and I'd stand up for my gf always. She has a hard time not making everyone happy and keeping the situation calm. I want to go even if they were to figure out, but she is nervous about it all.

She is considering asking another friend or her mom instead of me. At least, she said that, but I want to be the one to go with her and protect her and have a great time with her. I‚Äôm worried she may need my help plus I love her and just want to travel and see the world with her.

How can I comfort her and be at ease with me still going? how do I approach it? What do I say?",1573487374

isfj,"Incident happened only about an hour ago. For context, we are both in high school. I am INTJ (F) and need help regarding a situation with my friend ISFJ (M).

ISFJ and I became acquainted last year through some friends, but did not at all converse. We started talking approximately half a year ago because we had the same route to school. Nothing in particular has ever happened between us (minor misunderstandings and only one or two of those at that). We have become close, talk every day without fail, and ISFJ often looks to me for support, which I readily give to the best of my abilities.

Now, *everyone* who both of us know insists that ISFJ is interested in being more than friends. Admittedly, it did seem likely but I question it sometimes. Usually ISFJ exhibits typical ISFJ behaviour and sometimes feels more like my mom than my friend. ISFJ heavily hinted at being interested in me several times, however, I had not yet concluded whether further emotional investment would be safe and avoided it.

Recently, ESTP/ESTJ (F) has been avidly pursuing ISFJ. I am friends with ESTP/ESTJ, although we are not very close. ESTP/ESTJ shares some classes and extracurriculars with ISFJ. I began talking to ISFJ before ESTP/ESTJ did.

ESTP/ESTJ often displays slightly aggressive behavior, but wanting to be understanding, I brand it as jealousy. Unfortunately, I was not very aware that ISFJ might be interested in me initially and consistently made offhand jokes about ESTP/ESTJ and ISFJ being together. This upset ISFJ at one point, I explained myself, stopped the jokes, all is well.

Last week, ESTP/ESTJ became hurt that ISFJ was spending time with me and withdrew her request for ISFJ to do her a favor (the favor was obviously just an excuse to see ISFJ). ISFJ contacted me for help, although it quite seemed like something he was capable of dealing with on his own. ISFJ said that he was not interested in her and that there was already someone else on ISFJ's mind. I did not respond to this and instead tried to address the situation at hand.

The day after, ISFJ is suddenly quiet and claims that it is because a relative is in hospital, but refuses to elaborate. ISFJ admits being sad and this continues for a few days. At moments, ISFJ can revert to his normal behavior but seems to experience mood shifts frequently. Knowing that neglecting emotional needs is pretty characteristic of INTJs, I dedicate extra effort into asking if ISFJ is all right often. ISFJ improved after a week but remains somewhat withdrawn; I have tried to display some more affection to help.

I must admit that I have become quite fond of ISFJ. The company is very nice and I am never bothered by ISFJ's presence. However, I think that I may appear disinterested by avoiding the possibility that ISFJ is interested. 2 days ago, ISFJ asked me to go out to study after school, but I did not. The reason was *purely* because I was not allowed to that day. Yesterday (the day directly after), ISFJ says that going out to study alone was boring, sad etc. I wanted to attempt to explain that I did want to go but could not, nothing came out. I *physically cannot* say it. I did provide the precise reason as to why I was not allowed the day before (bad weather, my mom was already on the way to pick me up from school). According to other people, ISFJ was clearly disappointed and my reaction would not have helped.

Last night, I wanted to attempt to resolve ISFJ's withheld temper. I asked if I made ISFJ uncomfortable sometimes, to which ISFJ answered no. I pried a little to try and get something out of him but he clearly did not want to.

Now: I don't know why but I constantly feel as though I am being a nuisance to ISFJ. I don't want to bother ISFJ with my problems, but sometimes it gets a little challenging to hide sadness.

An hour ago, I was sitting with ISFJ and studying. My friend texted me: after observing a little, ISFJ said that it was fine if I wanted to sit with my female friends instead of him. This seemed like the last thing I needed to hear as I was already paranoid about being annoying, so I just shook my head and did not talk to him any more. When we got up to go to class, I guess I asked some general questions ('what do you have next?' 'when's your assignment due?'). ISFJ stood up and turned to leave, I looked back at ISFJ. ISFJ tried to ask what was wrong but I turned and walked away.

I have a hard time understanding ISFJ. I cannot understand why he does some of the things he does, whether ISFJ is interested at all, or why ISFJ is repressing emotions whilst normally being quite open to me, or why ISFJ refuses to talk about why he seems withdrawn. Any help is greatly appreciated.

isfj,"Hello everyone! Thank you for this wonderful group. It has been very helpful to me. I am an ENTJ male age 26(7w8 Ennegram and Quality Time and Physical Touch our my top love languages). I just started a committed and exclusive relationship with a beautiful and kind ISFJ girl age 24 (6w5 Ennegram and QT and AOS are her top LLs). We have been dating 2.5 months and exclusive for 1 month thus far.

I‚Äôm aware our personality types can really argue, repeal each other, and not get along when one or both of us are not healthy, but so far, we have done great together. Things have been an absolute blast, and I‚Äôm falling for this girl too quickly it feels like. It kind of scares me as an ENTJ, yet I think I love her.

I‚Äôve meet her parents and 4 of her friends. Everyone really likes me according to her and my friends and family like her a lot too.

She is always very kind, likes to listen, and likes to help me with small things when I need help. She also dresses well and seems to be above average with her makeup skills as far as I can tell. She seems to want to spend as much time with me as I do with her.

I really like her, and I think she really likes me but sometimes it‚Äôs hard to tell. She voices that she likes me and is very happy In the relationship but not as often as I do. 

I‚Äôm feeling like I love her and always want the best for her... plus I‚Äôm very attracted to her. Is it possible for ISFJ it be scared away with saying I love you too soon? Is it too soon?

How does an ISFJ feel when someone is just as committed as them in a relationship if not more? Do you think she wants me to say I love you? Maybe she would never say it first? The words mean a lot to her. She thinks true love never fades and it‚Äôs basically like saying I want to marry her and be with her forever and have a future with her.

I‚Äôm not sure the words mean that to me, but they do mean I‚Äôm seriously thinking about those things, and I‚Äôm willing to work through pretty much any issue with her when they surface (short of a huge lie she may have made that I might somehow learn about later. we have like no issues now). 

What do y‚Äôall think about this? What should an ENTJ be aware of when dating and falling for ISFJ? Any dating tips? We cuddle, hug, kiss, make out a little, no sex yet, watch her favorite shows together, go to party‚Äôs, hang out in groups, go on fun dates, etc. I try my best to listen and remember everything she says. I really want the best for her and she makes me feel happy.


tldr: I‚Äôm an ENTJ. New gf is ISTJ. We get along great so far. I think I might be more invested than her maybe. Hard to tell. I voice my feelings a little more than her. I want to say I love you but I‚Äôm also nerveless to go too far in too fast and scare her off. Thoughts? What relationship advice can you give me about an ISFJ girl?",1572382505

isfj,"There's a guy at work who's been here about 6 months - fairly certain he's ISFJ. He used to sit a few desks from me, but with a load of new starters, they had to fit people in and his team got moved round the corner (I didn't realise I fancied him until he got moved).

Our office matchmaker had asked me what I thought of him (seriously, she's trying to pair up everyone) and I said I liked him. Apparently he's looking to meet someone: she's tried pairing him with a few women she knows and none have worked out. I have no idea if she's working some magic in the background.

Recently I've noticed he seems to be seeking out my company more frequently (I usually eat lunch at my desk, as does he, but if I perch myself in the kitchen, he'll often come and join me if it's not too crowded). He's been quite stressed in the last few weeks (moving house, landlord issues) so most of our chats have centred around that. So he's unloading a lot of the time, but since he's quite introverted, I'm wondering if this is his way of finding a reason to talk to me. We do chat about other things too, bands we both like etc. And he has the most amazing memory recall for stuff I'd forgotten I'd mentioned weeks/months ago. On nights out to the pub after work, he has been slightly more tactile - hand on my arm kinda thing.

So I'm in that typical ENTP loop of ""is he into me or just being friendly?"" All possibilities but no certainty.

So how do you guys flirt? Is this it and he's silently screaming at me to pick up on this and ask him out? Is he ever likely to make the first move?

isfj,"I used to think that I was an intp and then an infp and now I think I might be an ISFJ. Could you please help me find my type?

‚Ä¢ How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.

I an eighteen-year-old woman and a university student studying English and Philosophy. I'm quite reserved‚ÄîI like to do most things alone and I do not have too many friends‚Äîbut I find that I quickly become outgoing when I'm talking about something I'm interested in or that I care about. Generally, I don't go out of my way to make friends or to make small talk, (though I've been trying to be more polite and caring to people), but I can talk for hours with a single person debating literature, philosophy, or politics. (I love arguing with people in a friendly non-committal way and bouncing ideas off of people.) I spend a lot of time reading books (never self-help books) and writing fiction and poetry. I like to think of myself as a logical person, although I've found that logic is easier to apply to specific situations like math and philosophy than to personal things like relationships and goals.

‚Ä¢ Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?

No

‚Ä¢ Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?

I was raised by both of my parents. We are upper-middle-class people; my mother is a housewife/bible study leader, and my father is a custom home builder. As a child, I was always considered the ""smart one."" My parents especially my mother had high expectations for me academically, and they wanted me to grow up to be successful. When I was in elementary and middle school, I cared too much about grades because my mother would be super disappointed in me if I didn't make straight As, but at the same time, I wished I didn't have to care about grades so much‚ÄîI wanted to learn for learning's sake, being a very curious kid like most kids. Whenever I didn't do well in a class, it was because it wasn't interesting to me or I was not responsible about turning in my work on time or doing homework. My parents encouraged me to be brave and creative; they encouraged me to act and to sing and to write. I loved doing all of those things, but I had some trouble fitting in with other kids who were into those things.

I was raised religiously, and I remember that I was very religious as a child. I would read the Bible all the time and try to interpret it (I really liked reading the book of Revelation) and I would try to feel God's presence in my life. I remember that when I was around eight or nine years old, I was worried that I didn't ""really believe"" in God and Jesus and I would go to hell for that. I think to some extent, I knew deep down that the belief in God was absurd, and I didn't believe it literally or with as much certainty as many other Christians did, and so felt that my faith wasn't real. I also read a lot of ""logical"" and ""scientific"" proofs or evidence for God's existence, and I suppose they made me feel slightly better about believing, but the ""evidence"" I knew didn't really hold water. Maybe, in the end, when I was still holding onto it, I was a Christian in bad faith. Now, I consider myself an atheist; it doesn't make a lot of sense for me to put my faith in a God that might not exist, though, in some ways, I admire those who can. I hate it when people call religious people and their faith ""stupid"" or childish, and I also hate it when ""Christians"" believe that having faith is as easy as just walking to the altar after service and ""accepting"" Jesus as their savior. That is just choosing ignorance. I think religious people need to know that their faith is irrational and keep their faith still knowing that it is irrational.

(As you can tell, I think a lot about religion, and sometimes I joke to myself that I'm going to study to become an atheist theologian.)

‚Ä¢ What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?

I don't have a job or a career right now because I'm a full-time student. I love school and being around professors and other students who are passionate about their fields and about ideas. What I hate about my university experience is the focus on grades and GPA and the expectations I put on myself to be the ""best"" student in every class‚ÄîI think that hinders my learning and risk-taking. Right now, I'm involved in a lot of extracurricular activities; I'm the president of the creative writing club; I'm doing research on the existential themes of The Bell Jar; I'm an editor at my school's literary journal. Sometimes, I feel like these activities exhaust me, but I also feel like they are what keep me going. One of my favorite classes is the course on Modernist British literature because the poems and stories we are reading are difficult and enigmatic and therefore provoke interesting discussions. My other favorite (and in some ways least favorite) class is Creative Writing Fiction because I like learning about craft and I like to explore perceptions and ideas through characters and fictional relationships. The reason why it's also my least favorite class is that I don't like people critiquing my work before it is finished. I find that my best work is done in secret and that workshopping or critiquing is not always helpful in the creative process.

‚Ä¢ If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?

I would feel happy to have time to myself and to have time to read and write. I don't get lonely easily, though when I get stuck in rut in my work, I like to talk to other people in order to get new ideas directly or indirectly. In general, I try to be alone as much as possible in order to avoid distractions (I'm distracted easily) and to absorb myself into whatever I'm doing. I like to take walks by myself and to go to cafes and museums by myself to watch people and to think about things or to take a break from thinking about things.

‚Ä¢ What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?

I like to read and to write, as I've mentioned before, and I also like watching movies and listening to music. I also like to talk to my boyfriend of three because he is super smart and funny and everything mundane is fun to do with him. I don't like to play or to watch sports, though while I was watching the World Series I liked to imagine that the athletes were actors and to compare how theatre is watched and how sport is watched. However, I do like hiking and skiing‚ÄîI'm actually really good at skiing. Though I don't seem like the type, I sometimes like to do things that feel ""dangerous"" or risky.

‚Ä¢ How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?

I am really curious. Now, as I'm doing research on things and writing about things, I'm sad that there is never enough time to learn all the things you want to learn. Lately, I've become curious about phenomenology as I've attempted to read Being and Nothingness, but I find that it is very difficult, having such a long history of ideas that build on each other. I am curious about literature and literary theory also about writing fiction and figuring out how to experiment with form. I always have more ideas than I can execute‚ÄîI have a million stories and poems I want to write‚Äîbut I am also a perfectionist, so it takes me a long time to finish a piece.

‚Ä¢ Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?

For a while, I didn't of myself as a good leader. Although I'm starting to get better about it, I've always had trouble with organization and being consistent. Now that I'm the president of the creative writing club, I find that it's pretty rewarding to help people get their work to where they want it to be, and I enjoy leading discussions on issues of craft, literature, and philosophy. I don't like to be an authoritarian figure (although I sometimes fantasize about it) and I want everybody to be included and to have input. I don't always like the idea of being a leader since I like to focus on individual projects and I don't like being responsible for other people.

‚Ä¢ Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?

I'm not coordinated. I'm a bad dancer, though pretty good at sex.

‚Ä¢ What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?

I think of my past sometimes. Sometimes I wonder how things would have been different if I had made different choices or if things happened differently, but I can't say I have too many regrets. I view the past as a story that you tell yourself to make sense of your present; your own view of your past is almost never accurate or reliable.

I try to live in the present, to enjoy life and being young, but sometimes I worry so much about growing old and having wasted my time that I actually end up wasting my time. Now, I try to pour myself into anything that I am working on at the moment, and my expectations for myself even though I am still young are very high.

As for the future, I haven't gotten a lot of things figured out, though I will apply to MFA programs and PhD literature programs (I'm in my sophomore year and I'm writing my writing sample.) I don't know exactly what I'm going to do with my life, whether I will work in journalism or teach or be a starving artist, and maybe to some extent I don't care all that much. I'll be happy as long as I don't hate my job and I have time to write. I like to keep my options open and to see what happens to me. I think there are many ways for me to be content.

‚Ä¢ How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?

I try to help people, though I'm not always good at it. I have to remind myself to care about other people and to make sure they know I care. One of my main beliefs is that everybody is important and deserves your attention and your kindness, but it's difficult to live up to that. I get very annoyed when people ask me to do things they could have done themselves.

‚Ä¢ Do you need logical consistency in your life?

It's important to me that my ideas are logically sound, that I'm not making decisions or forming ideas based on common assumptions or practice.

‚Ä¢ How important is efficiency and productivity to you?

Somewhat important, though when it comes to art, you should never sacrifice quality for efficiency or productivity.

‚Ä¢ Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?

I try not to be controlling‚ÄîI hate the idea of controlling others‚Äîthough sometimes I find myself being manipulative. I sometimes pretend to feel or think something in order to elicit a certain response in the other person. I think I do that when I am insecure and worried that people I care about are indifferent to me or aren't really loyal to me even if they act in a way that suggests that they love me.

‚Ä¢ What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?

I like to learn things on my own; I prefer classes that have assigned reading that we discuss in class or that we are lectured on. I struggle with lab-style classes‚Äîthey bore me, and I don't like classes that have a lot of multiple-choice tests. I prefer classes that don't require a lot of rote memorization‚ÄîI forget facts easily if they don't make me think or feel anything‚Äîand I like classes that involve analysis, logic, and creativity.

‚Ä¢ How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?

I'm pretty good at strategizing and coming up with plans, though I have trouble following through with them. Before a project, I sometimes try to break it up into manageable tasks, though when I start to work I almost never do things in the order that I planned. I have to say I pretty good at improvisation, though I suspect that it is not true improvisation since even if I don't follow a clear plan, I always contemplate a lot before acting.

‚Ä¢ What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?

I want to create good works of literature and criticism. I don't necessarily want to become famous or anything, but it is important for my work to have insight and to provide a unique and perhaps subversive way of looking at the world. I want my work to expose the strangeness, horror, and beauty of everyday life and human thought‚ÄîI think that is my main ambition. Although I want to be a great writer, I never want to have to rely on my writing for my income since that would make it difficult for me to write in a way that is honest and innovative. I would always want to have a teaching job or other kind of job, to give me the everyday experience to fuel my writing.

I don't think I'll ever want to get married, though I want a life-long love with somebody. I don't want to get married because I don't think my relationship needs the social sanction that marriage represents. And beyond that marriage doesn't mean too much. Your loyalty to a person isn't a one-time promise you make to a person at your marriage ceremony, it has to be a promise that you make continuously. Being married can lead people to be complacent in their relationship. If the contract of being married is the only thing keeping two people together then their commitment is empty; they care more about the status of their marriage than any true bond with each other.

‚Ä¢ What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?

My greatest fear is being incompetent, not really understanding anything. It's pretty hard to make me uncomfortable in a social sense, though I sometimes think I make other people uncomfortable. I hate it when people have selfish ambition and think they are better than other people. I think that comes from my belief that there are no minor characters in life, that everyone is important and in some ways filled with the same spirit‚Äîthat's the only way I can explain it though I'm not too sure about the existence of souls or spirituality.

‚Ä¢ What do the ""highs"" in your life look like?

I get very excited when I am working on something that I care about, or when I write something that I am happy with, though the satisfaction is short-lived. I also get very excited when suddenly the world seems very beautiful, full of possibility and I feel like I am accessing a heightened and transcendent way of perceiving things. As I've said I'm not too spiritual but I don't know else to describe that sort of experience of the world.

‚Ä¢ What do the ""lows"" in your life look like?

I am horribly insecure. I never feel pretty enough or smart enough I creative enough. Even though many people tell me that I am intelligent and beautiful and some people admire my work, I wonder if deep down, I'm actually incompetent, ugly, and stupid‚Äîthat my intelligence, the quality of my work is only a facade. I want to be able to forget myself in my work, to stop seeing my work as a reflection of my internal qualities, but often, I get stuck believing that failure in my work is evidence of an intrinsic flaw in myself.

‚Ä¢ How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?

I have trouble paying attention to my surroundings, since I'm so stuck in my head thinking about concepts and my plans.

‚Ä¢ Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?

I would wonder why I'm there, if I have gone mad, if I am dreaming.

‚Ä¢ How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?

Too long. I change my mind often.

‚Ä¢ How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?

It takes me a while to figure out what I'm feeling, although in general, I am pretty clear about past feelings. Emotions are very important in my life, though I am often overwhelmed by negative emotions.

‚Ä¢ Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?  
If I don't agree with someone, I would just say I don't.

‚Ä¢ Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?

I don't break rules unless I need to. I never followed my parents' rules too strictly. I guess when I was a kid I learned that my parents gave me more freedom when I bent the rules. I think authority should always be challenged. There is nothing inherent in authority figures that makes them good leaders.",1572125924
isfj," I think my friend needs help but I dont know what to do. Any advise?
Im an INFP woman and had a brief but intense relationship with an ISFJ man. We strongly connected, almost immediately and have a lot in beliefs and hobbies in common. He shared a lot of very painful, personal stuff with me. He had an abusive, violent childhood and went on to have 2 abusive, narcissistic marriages, then suffered a mental breakdown. Now he has virtually shut himself away from people, except for work. But has a tinder account. I met him from Tinder. üôÑ He often said he hadnt told anyone else things he had told me.
I got very mixed messages from him. On one hand, he was amazing and loving and open. Then... would shut off and I wouldnt see him for a week or more . He was drunk one night and very emotional, saying that everyone always leaves him eventually so hes better off staying alone. Then later he told me he would never have a live together relationship again and would be content with once a week visit from me. I broke up with him because Im looking for a life partner and need more than that. He was unemotional and said fine, thats it then. And I havent heard from him since.

isfj,"Hi all, female ISFP (30) here getting a bit closer to a male ISFJ (28). 

Title was meant to be a tongue in the cheek joke :p but yeah, I was curious if this ISFJ is being just super-friendly to me? (we are platonic friends FYI)

I deal with anxiety and self-confidence issues, so the tendency to overthink/misread signals/jump the gun is real...

I think I may have a bit of a crush on him. And if I get I sense that a guy has a crush on me, I completely freak out and act all weird (i.e. anxiety mode: activated, tenfolds). 

So yeah, put your Sherlock-thinking-cap/hat on; here‚Äôs a few clues: 

‚Ä¢ He very private/reserved and only shares a few superficial trivia about himself. Doesn‚Äôt seems to elaborate too much on his opinions/feelings (rarely share) either. Probably won‚Äôt do me favors if I pry. But he tries to empathize with me and shared a personal experience when I was going through a very rough time in my life. Assured it‚Äôs ok for me to be vulnerable and offer to lend a ear if I ever wanted to talk. 

‚Ä¢ He is fully present when hanging out with me. I like that he‚Äôs not constantly checking his phone when together. 

‚Ä¢ We‚Äôre kinda like a dynamic-super-passive-duo (lol)...I mean, we go hiking/strolling together but mostly end up doing activities that I dubbed as ‚Äòold lady stuff‚Äô (i.e. sit and talk for hours, just enjoying the moment). I really enjoy them but can‚Äôt tell if he‚Äôs actually having fun with me or just going along with it... he tells me he enjoys the company haha.

‚Ä¢ For a holiday event, he invited me to hangout together when he could have chosen to hangout with his much cooler friends (I know he social-able since he brings up his friends in his conversations) ...we had a bit of a misadventure and he end up having to taking care of me. 

‚Ä¢ Not proud of it; I‚Äôve ghosted on him on so many occasions within a short span of time (depression puts my into my toxic hibernation/hermit mode) and apologized. Rinse and repeat. He was really understanding of me and doesn‚Äôt seem affected at all. He was always there... 

‚Ä¢ He tends to initiate contact/texts to check on me and invitation to hang-out more than I do...and he‚Äôs  insistent with it. I feel bad having him do all the work and been meaning to invite him to hangout together for fun or just to talk. 

‚Ä¢ Recently, we‚Äôve been having daily conversations and decided to do activities together apart. I feel like I‚Äôm getting a bit too clingy and overdoing it with my try-hard jokes/overly-caring/pleasing/positivity at this point (yikes). He seems to be ok with my sudden clinginess but I‚Äôm backing way off so I won‚Äôt drain/suffocate him with my emotionally intensity (I forewarned him and he thinks it‚Äôs a personal quirk...poor guy has zero clue yet how far I could take him into the depth of my soul) 

‚Ä¢ He got drunk once and called me by another girl‚Äôs name (I think it might be his ex...he mentioned they used to be really close) I had zero idea how to react to that and pretend it didn‚Äôt happen. I‚Äôve been meaning to bring it up but it might make things super awkward, so I just let it be...for now (too inquisitive to let things slide). 

‚Ä¢ Speaking of names, he sometimes  call me by these rather cringey nicknames. I think it‚Äôs very endearing but cringey nevertheless lol...actually, we are both pretty much cringe as individuals, together haha. 

‚Ä¢ I‚Äôm not a fan of being touch and have avoided his advances in the past. Nothing inappropriate. He seem to sense that touching makes me uncomfortable so respects my personal boundaries but if he does make contact, his touch is quite swift and gentle. Now that I trust him more, I find myself wanting to be physically closer to him. I could see me making all the moves on him ha ha 

I‚Äôm sure he has other female friends (probably treat them the same too) and wouldn‚Äôt be surprised at all if he was actually dating (never confirmed, I assumed‚Äîbut soon, I shall) since he‚Äôs a seriously a great catch (willing to vouch for him for potential dating prospects!)...as much as I like him, he‚Äôs a distraction/ain‚Äôt got time for boyz; I‚Äôm focusing on self-growth/bettering myself at the moment...I think he‚Äôs super oblivious. 

So, what to make of this ISFJ? 

P.s. Low-key showing my appreciation: Healthy/mature ISFJs are a very lovely bunch, mad respect to your loyalty/dependability!

Basically:  I am an ISFJ woman (25)  dating an INTP man(23). We have been dating the past couple of months. We had spent two long weekends away together when he met my sister, we hung out with her and her boyfriend. That night, I said I wanted us to have sex for the first time. He panicked a bit, since we had not ""defined the relationship"" and he knew how big of a deal it was for me. ( I was a virgin.) He said he wanted to continue dating, but was not ready to be exclusive. I was upset, (I had said I was ready to stop dating other people) but agreed. A few days later he sent flowers to my work saying he was lucky to have me in his life and he really liked me. The next time I saw him, a couple days later, we slept together.

I may have used it to a really huge extent, but it's like now she's getting so nitpicky with my actions and overanalysing every single facial expression. Especially my face. I can't even _display_ any signs of annoyance and when I actually don't (because I've grown so immune to her passive aggressive ways), she thinks I do and starts shouting at me and saying I'm justifying myself when I'm merely telling her that I wasn't even angry. 

Sometimes she thinks that she's soooo good to me and claims that she only shouts when I crossed the line but I simply can't think of a time where she tried to make a compromise and talked things through logically. When it's good, it's good. But it's often bad. 

She just can't leave me alone. When she's not angry, she's obsessed with my health and asks the same questions over and over again. 

She's even gone nuts, laughing crazily one minute and then crying the next. I may have caused that, but it feels like victimisation sometimes. She said that her entire life is based on my dad and I, and I literally told her to get a life and find a job because I can take care of myself but she doesn't want to. I strongly believe the rule of stoicism: That no man can cause one to feel pain but oneself.

isfj,"Hi everyone. I'm INFP and I've been out of relationship for two years now. Being single again, never really flirted a woman until I met this vibrant ISFJ. To make story short, someone gave me her name and sent her a friend's request and we started from there. I started our conversation by a simple question, and her name fascinates me so I tell her about other stuff, like some playful words about her name, little history behind it, etc (We INFP overthinks what we would say, and long messages from us is a sign we are into you). I shoot her a text every morning. I replied back sometimes on evening, mainly to avoid long ""mini-talks"" or casual talk. We INFPs finds casual conversation as draining, as we seek and prefer a deep and meaningful conversation. This might clash to her as ""sensing"" type. She might prefer a conversation about day to day basis. Not really sure if I bothered her about me being an ""intuitive"" type. Our text becomes regular and a little deeper. Im flexing my INFP ability to communicate with her, being creative about telling a joke, being poetic and subtle about telling her that shes beautiful and attractive. My past girlfriend was a ESTJ and she had told me that she appreciates me for being deep and imaginative. She had that lovely response on a sweet poems, or a guitar song that I wrote. I don't know if this hits you too, irritates you, or just ok with it. I felt that my conversations with this ISFJ lady on text were meaningless without a face to face interaction. She lives a bit far and our schedules do not match but my INFP inner self is telling me to find ways and try to visit her, bring her a dish that I prepared maybe, and a post card at least to tell that I really I appreciated her time she provided for me.

I just watched Meghan Levota from Youtube's video about ""INFJ Bitchiness"" (although she said this can apply to ISFJs as well since both have aux Fe and tert Ti).

An INFJ tweeted at her, ""How do i stop being bitchy? I didn't actually do anything wrong, I just feel bitchiness deep in my core.""

This is something I relate to 100% and have been struggling a lot with lately.

Meghan explained that this comes from Tert-Ti. IxFJ's have the tool of introverted thinking, but they don't always know how to use it. When a harsh opinion flares up, our extraverted feeling steps in and says ""hey, that's not nice!"" and suppresses the Ti judgment. This suppression can also manifest itself in these types when they say ""oh, who, me? I don't have ANY controversial opinions,"" and just try to play nice for the sake of Fe.

In the end, the Ti builds and builds until it starts leaking out into our interactions with others- either we'll start judging them, resenting them, saying harsh things, or even acting passive aggressive around them.

Meghan offers that the best way to combat this is to try to express our Ti more, as painful as it can be. We have Fe to balance out our ""judgments"" and so if we have a critique of someone, we can tell them in a way that is productive and helpful to everyone involved instead of allowing that judgment to fester.

isfj,"My concerns aren't about him being mean to me or anything like that (he has never done such things), he's a great boyfriend and friend, it's rather about helping him deal with his stuff.

We've been dating for six months now, and I've known since the very beginning of our relationship that he's not passionate about what he's pursuing as a major, but not only that, he's doing it just so he can take over his mum's office, because she pushed him to do so. And so, I'm worried about his mum's control over him.

So, he works for his mum, he's underpaid (USD 132,23 / ‚Ç¨ 120,84) and his mum takes a portion of his already short money to herself, which leaves him with about USD 72,14 / ‚Ç¨ 65,91 for the entire month. (we're not American nor European) he should be getting paid about ‚Ç¨ 219,66 / USD 240,41 (minimum wage in our country), considering he works almost full time for her, but that's not what happens.

I've suggested to him to look for jobs somewhere else, because he would get a way better salary and work less than he does at the moment, but his mum implied he could never get a job somewhere else (not because of incompetence or anything like that, just because she wouldn't let him), not even if it was a WAY better job. She says frequently that ""why would he look for a job somewhere else if he already has his mum's office to work for?""

Sometimes she even takes money from his wallet without his knowledge and permission, and I do know she pays him and stuff but in my humblest opinion, she shouldn't do that, it gives her no right to take his money even though she pays him, because he has worked hard to get it.

Her control over him concerns almost every aspect of his life, some of which I have not mentioned here, and I'm afraid it might start affecting our relationship in a way that we might not be able to make it alive.

He has tried a few times to free himself from such things but every time it happens, things get worse.

I'm seeking advice on how to help him free himself from being so obedient to everything she demands, not only as a girlfriend obviously, but as a friend would do.

TL;DR: Bf's mum is controlling, he tried freeing himself from that, things got worse, I'm seeking advice on how to help him (I'm also afraid his mum's control over him is going to affect our relationship and ruin it in a way).",1570030704

We realize we have a lot of similar interests: we met through a niche game genre, we like lots of favorite food, our political interests align (hard to find in my area), and ultimately we're just lazy nerds.

We've even added each other on a few different social media and talk on those places pretty often. We have our phone numbers but rarely talk through there. We've also started a mini-project together.

So some issues are... she lives 2 states over. Even if I were to ask her out I dunno if Id wanna do it over social media text since Ive only seen her in person 3 times. We've had some talks about relationships and she said she's accidentally given mixed signals to guy(s) that have asked her about before without knowing. She seems to want someone closer to her age (I'm 30, and she's 25) based on what I infer from screenshots below.

So I'm an ISFJ who's never been in a real relationship (she's had at least 1 ex apparently) and I dunno if anyone's been in a situation where I'm interested in someone who's either dated an ENTP, dated someone long distance, and/or in a relationship where both parties are lazy nerds who don't live close to each other.

It's gotten to the point where I had a dream about being with her and when i think of her I have to try to temper my expectations with a Hawkeye ""Don't Give Me Hope"".

If anyone has an any insight/advice based on anything I've stated I'd love to hear it. Thanks!

One nice thing about reddit is I can get embarrassingly obsessed about stuff anonymously, I guess.

Especially the first one, apparently, since its so near/dear to the individual its hard for them to imagine being another way. 

I've test INFP pretty much forever, but now that I know more about functions I've been delving into them more. It really helped re-frame how I thought about sensing vs. intuition, extroverted vs. introverted, etc. 

People comment on it a lot, but people can be kinda harsh on sensing. I'm thinking that's because people just getting into personality theory don't know what sensing really means, but I dunno for sure. 

I don't know why it bothers me so much, but I've also noticed that people consistently put ISFJs into a box that doesn't really fit their cognitive functions and just assumes things. 

The funny thing is, when I first got into MBTI forever ago that's what people were doing to INFPs. People would talk about how most INFJs are just INFPs faking. Now I get back into it and INFPs are the type-du-jour and people accuse ISFJs of faking being INFPs.

I didn‚Äôt view it as passive aggressive at the time, but rather would feel so deeply hurt that  I would withdraw and go silent. In most relationships I‚Äôve become so much better at dealing with issues and moving past them. 

Except for one relationship....

I have a sister, 6 years older than me and she was extremely emotionally and physically abusive to me when I was a child from ages 5-12- lots of name calling, hitting, and doing things like forcing me to eat food until I threw up and then make me clean it up. Lots more that I won‚Äôt get into. 

Anyway, as we got older, she did apologize (once) and we ended up having a fairly good adult relationship- that is until about 6 years ago. 

My sister came to visit (she lives in a different state) and during a family get together her new partner who I had just met for the first time laughingly brought up some of the abusive things that happened to me (this was in front of my kids, mom, and said sister). I shut down and was kind of in numb shock for a while. I didn‚Äôt say anything at the time and since then just shut my sister out from that moment.

isfj,"The point of least resistance (POLR) in Socionics is each type's weakest and painful function. This is the reversed E/I attitude of the third function so since our third function is Introverted Thinking our POLR function would then be Extroverted Thinking. In short description, Te tends to be more concerned with efficiency and goal achievement in the outer world and Ti tends to be more concerned with analyzing info internally and rooting out bad data for greater precision and accuracy of data. 

For me my POLR Te mainfests in hating dealing with outside facts and black and white truths from the outer world. I get frustrated when someone says this is a fact or truth but refuses to explain the underlying logic behind this fact/truth. Like  for me when confront with Te arguments I wonder things like Why is this factual? How can we separate the difference between something that is a truth and something that isn't a truth? I think for IxFJ types we really need to understand the underlying logic or logical framework behind why something is true to accept it as legitimate. I tend to see Ti as being this interconnected web of logic where all the data fits together like a puzzle or something. I definitely need to have a solid understanding of something or personal experience of something for me to accept it as true. 

I thought it'd be nice to have a discussion about this. So how does POLR Te mainfest for my fellow ISFJs?",1567022876

The only reason I‚Äôm putting up with one of my best friends is because we‚Äôve been through a lot together.

However it‚Äôs feeling definitely really frustrating to be around her because:

- She is unhealthily conflict avoidant. A guy cancelled plans with her causing her to lose money. She is broke af, but she just tells him it‚Äôs no big deal when she is actually really angry. Why can‚Äôt she just be honest about the way she feels??? I tell her to just tell the truth, that it actually is a big deal, and get it resolved, get her money back. 

Her response? She doesn‚Äôt respond to me and changes the subject. I want to pull my hair out.

- I‚Äôve told her not to ghost a guy because it‚Äôs unkind. She says ‚Äúok‚Äù and then proceeds to ghost him anyway. 

- There was a time if she‚Äôd said something, she would‚Äôve saved my plans from being a total disaster. Later she admitted she knew something was off, but never fucking bothered to mention it.

- I‚Äôm just tired of caring about her well being and trying for her to be a better person, and just feeling like she‚Äôs coasting off of the good things I‚Äôve given her: like her career, cheaper food because I‚Äôm better off than her so she tends to pay me back $1 or $2 less than she owes, stressing out because she‚Äôs always late to things with no concern about how it effects others.

-seems both remarkably mature and yet innocent for his age
-cares and picks up on the feelings of others, and tries to maintain harmony if he can
-appears quiet and sensitive, a little shy at first, ok working alone, seems to hate most people, is pretty jaded--but has LOTS of ""bursts"" of extroversion--almost acts like a bigshot and full of himself, sometimes.  And yet, is also fairly humble and self-deprecating.  Also likes to tease people, and is quite a smartass.  I would call him an extroverted introvert.
-somewhat responsible and ambitious, but also seems to know the world operates purely on bullshit.  Willing to play the game, but always knows it's a game, and secretly congratulates himself when he plays it well.
-relating to people, he acts like everyone's protective big brother or good-natured respectful son.  He will occasionally snark behind people's backs, but not nearly as much as other guys that age.
-kind of creative verbally and loves to make up stories (lies) and see if you'll believe them.  Is this an ISFJ thing?  My ISFJ mom loves doing this.  April Fool's is her favorite holiday!
-Seems extremely sensitive but very resilient when faced with setbacks or personal slights.  Like he's easily hurt, but has a lot of determination and self-respect.  He just seems very ""sane""

* I told her that i'm interested in her and she told me that she is interested in me as well but she's not sure what she wants to do since my core group of friends consist of her brother and her cousins. She doesn't want to ruin any dynamic within my friend group. I understand that but I also want to at least go on a date and see if we're compatible first. She doesn't know how she feels about a date.   
* We haven't done anything intimate, yet she says that we're moving too fast. It's been 2 weeks since we told each other how we felt and I don't understand what she means when she say's we're moving too fast. I feel like we're just in the planning phase, i'm not event completely sure if I like her and yet she says that we need to slow down.
* She mentioned that she enjoys being single and that there's no one else she's involved with in her life. Yet, when i asked her if we should stop, she says she doesn't know. I'm a person of 1's and 0's, anything outside of that confuses me.

We're both in our late 20's so I'm hoping that she's mature enough not to play games with me. She said that she wants to think about it some more before we move forward; as I mentioned before, I feel like we haven't even started yet. I'm just confused and don't know what to do.

isfj,"hi everyone. i‚Äôve noticed that many ISFJs tend to crave attention from their loved ones (not in an attention seeking or spotlight hugging way, just in a love and care, emotional support and conversation sort of way). 

one of my closest friends is an ISFJ, and she is like this. she texts me all the time, and wants to hang out for prolonged periods of time, despite introverts being drained easily. 

she is super shy, though, and somewhat socially awkward. she‚Äôs also socially anxious, which adds on. she may just be a shy and socially anxious extravert, but she is a classic ISFJ, and does recharge from time by herself. she‚Äôs more introverted than i am, though i‚Äôm not what one might call a ‚Äústereotypical introvert‚Äù in certain situations. 

this is, of course, just my one experience, but i‚Äôve noticed this trend in others sharing their experiences, so my initial inference checks out. 

what i‚Äôm trying to say is that ISFJs seem to be one of the most social and attention/emotional support needing introverted types. not as much as ESFJs, but definitely more than many other introverted types. ESFJs tend to be very and super social, and while ISFJs are usually quieter and prefer more intimacy, they still require and seek out lots of care and love from their loved ones.

I'm pretty sure she's ISFJ, but some things make me doubt it. I'd love to hear some of your inputs :) 
Why I think she's ISFJ :
- Her Fe is kindda obvious to me. She'd do the appropriate social behaviour when in groups even if it annoys her deepdown. She likes the group even when she's a bit out of it, thinks about how to make others happy and safe, etx
- Really curious about other people's life details, really active, does not like to daydream or rest or be bored.
- She likes to tell these practical stories of past events of her life. (Si?) Also she tends to plan things very well, thinking about practical details and stuff.
In general she's a very sweet person, shy yet social, she relies a lot on other people to feel motivated, she's sensitive to the group energy etc. 

What makes me doubt :
Ok, it might sound silly, and it might be just me misunderstanting how Si work.
That's why I'd like to get your opinions :D
She wants to live a different kind of life than the one this capitalist system offer us. A life less centered around money and work, closer to nature, being self sufficient ect (it's actually this point that makes me really connect with her).
Now it's a bit weird cause this is both traditionnal yet very innovative concepts.
She likes to go to places with this kind of living, autonomous communities, etc,... 
For me (INFP) I love this places too 'cause it fits both my Fi and Ne. 
So could this fit a Si dom aswell? Maybe it's same symptom but different reasons?
I don't think she has lived this as a kid, but she did some work away travel in a ecological farm that she really liked. 

- she doesnt seem so in touch with her body sensations. For instance, she told me she ""forgets"" to drink water. I think its weird for a Si dom? (Si is on my weaker stack of function and I get a bit paranoid over my body, I'm potomaniac and a bit hypocondriac)

That's all i think of now.
So - Is ISFJ a good guess for her? Or do the last two things really make this weird?

Thank you all.

isfj,"So I understand every personality category has room for individual variation, but my boyfriend fits the ISFJ cleanliness stereotype to a T. He is always well-dressed and put-together. Because his appearance matters so much to him and because he knows he generally looks very put-together, I'm having a hard time talking to him about body odor issues. Two in particular, his breath and his feet. 

  

He brushes his teeth every morning and night with an electric toothbrush for 4 minutes each and then uses mouthwash, so it's not like he's ignoring his oral hygiene. But for some reason, his breath still smells really rank by midday. He drinks a lot of coffee, and when he comes home from work the coffee breath compounded with whatever he had for lunch is so gross that I have a hard time kissing him. Same if we go out to dinner or something, that food smell is so strong. In the mornings, his breath is the worst. I hate saying this, but it smells like dog poop. I floss nightly and I try to get him to do the same, but he refuses and it's become a sore point now if I bring it up. I noticed he doesn't clean his tongue, so I'd like to get him a tongue scraper but I don't know how to do it without insulting him. 

  

His feet also started getting stinky this year. When he comes home from work and takes his shoes off, it's terrible. At first, he didn't believe me but then he started smelling it himself. His solution was to soap between his toes more intentionally in the shower and wear clean socks every morning, but on any day that he doesn't the smell is just as bad. I struggled with this in my midtwenties personally, so I explained what helped me (using foot scrubs to remove dead skin, cleaning under my toenails, putting baking soda in my shoes) but he is SO STUBBORN and will not take the advice I give him. 

  

Basically I'm not sure if this is a me problem or an us problem. I've never had this issue with other exes and deal with some gross smells at work, so I don't think I have an overly sensitive nose. I want him to use my solutions bc I know through personal experience that they work, but I also don't want to be patronizing. I feel like I'm approaching this the wrong way, so I was hoping you guys could tell me how you'd like to be spoken to about these issues, or what's helped you in the past?",1565802692
isfj,"I've been playing music my whole life and I've questioned lately if I can actually be a good musician, in the sense of being able to create my own art. I guess I just sort of have an inferiority complex towards iNtuitives. All the artists I look up to are iNtuitives, like either INFJ's or INFP's. I feel like they can see things I don't and that expressing themselves seems to come naturally to them. They're just natural artists.

Whenever I try making something of my own I can never seem to come up with anything I actually like. I have these initial ideas sometimes, like a dream I had for example that made me feel a certain way that I'd like to make into a song. But when I sit down and try making the song I can never come up with any melodies or harmonies that capture what I actually felt. It's really annoying, I know what I feel and what I want to make but I just don't know how. Out of all the music I've ever made I think there are only 2 songs I can be sort of happy with. But I'm not all that happy with the lyrics, which is also a thing I'm struggling with in the same way.

What really brought me down was searching for if there actually were any successful ISFJ musicians out there and hardly finding any. I looked through some forums discussing this issue and some ISFJ's expressed the same struggles as me trying to be creative. They're better at replicating something than coming up with something of their own. And if they do come up with something they almost never show it to others or they're being too much of a perfectionist to actually get anywhere with it.

This has just really been bringing me down lately and I think it's also because of people around me nagging me to write my own music. I know they'd just like to support me pursuing being an artist, but I just find it so hard. I do think music is my true passion though, it's the one thing I've always loved and the one thing I can always turn to. Being able to use it to express myself the way I want to would make my life so much better though. So, are there any ISFJ musicians/artists reading this?

isfj,"Ok, this is going to be a long post but so I'll do a TL;DR at the top

**TL;DR** \- Recently went through a tough break-up and now I can't find any or little enjoyment in old hobbies.

Alright so I recently got out of my first long term relationship and It didn't go well. I got depressed about the ending of the relationship and was very bitter towards myself (even though I couldn't have changed anything to save the relationship). Thankfully, I'm much better and happier now but ,for some reason, I have lost basically all interest in my hobbys. Previously, the 4 things I loved to do were; Spend time with my gf, play games, play my guitar/produce music on my laptop and spend time on my phone browsing Reddit, YouTube, Instagram, etc. After the relationship, I can't bring myself to do any of these. 

* **Spend time with my gf** \- Well, that's off the table
* **Play my guitar/ produce music on my laptop** \- I used to love writing, learning and playing my own music on my guitar and I was starting to teach myself how to produce and mix music on my laptop. However, now, I can't even bring myself to play my guitar for more than 10 minutes without dying from boredom and I don't even want to think about producing songs. 
* **Play games** \- I still enjoy playing games with my friends every once in a while but I get bored after an hour or two. I use to just switch to single-player games when I was bored with multiplayer but I can't bring myself to play alone anymore. For example, I bought firewatch, a game I've been interested in for months, on a recent steam sale and I've had it downloaded for over a month and I still haven't played it.
* **Spend time on my phone browsing Reddit, YouTube, Instagram, etc**. - Now, I still do enjoy doing this. I still check my Reddit feed and Instagram several times a day and I watch YouTube for at least an hour but (please don't judge me lol) I used to be able to do this for HOURS. I could've probably spent the whole day doing YouTube before but now I can only watch it for an hour or two before needing to do something else.

IDK if this is normal for anyone changing or going through heartbreak but the boredom is eating me up badly atm and I could really do with some help. If anyone has any suggestions for hobbys that typical ISFJs love (or any hobbies whatsoever) I would really appreciate you telling me. Thanks :)

&amp;#x200B;

  I am scarily tech savvy, but i haven't stepped foot in anything remotely related to programming, which I am very scared of. I also love old stuff, and everything related to it.  I don't want a job that's very abstract, and want something that is practical in a sense. I also love facts, details, and all that crap.

&amp;#x200B;

 I used to be a big fan of technology (that is partly where my proficiency in technology comes from), although not in that geek way that is so often stereotyped (guy that codes in his dreams), but sort of like a gadget geek who is always up to date on the latest advancements in technology, and like a corporate connoisseur who really seems determined to know everything about companies, from their early history, to their recent developments and financial statuses. That interest kinda faded away, but i'm pretty sure I can reconcile

I‚Äôm starting college in a couple weeks and am nervous about moving in. The thing is, my college is known for being a party school, but I chose it because it has amazing academics and is a Catholic school (I‚Äôm very religious). It‚Äôs also 30 minutes from home, so I can visit my family on the weekends.

I decided to take a risk and live on campus rather than commute. However, I‚Äôve already run into problems. I made it very clear on my roommate survey that I am committed to being substance free (they said they try to put those people together), go to bed by 11:30 (I won‚Äôt be able to function without sleep), and prefer to be with someone who wakes up earlier than me.

I ended up getting assigned with two people who want to have parties in the dorm, smoke, drink, and stay up late. I‚Äôve already said to them them that I‚Äôd prefer if we didn‚Äôt have parties in the dorm and that I‚Äôm okay with drinking, as long as they‚Äôre not wildly drunk in our dorm. They also want to stay up late. Unfortunately, they didn‚Äôt agree to not do that.

I contacted residence life and requested a transfer (I should hear back from them tomorrow), but this leads me to three main questions (which I‚Äôll put in the TL;DR).

I would like to know what you as ISFJ would like your partner to do so that you feel loved. 

It can be a gift  or behaviour or way of managing. Anything. Basically I'm ISTP girl and have ISFJ partner. I'm very happy with him but I can see that he can do things I can't. He would say: ""I love you"" often (I do if I remember to, but basically for me it is a statement that stands untill said otherwise). He would take care of me (while for me it is basically nice but not needed- I would really survive without flowers and tick-puller device). 

Generally I can see that he expresses love in a different way then I would think off (I usually express it via food, arranging experiences for him, sex or else help in critical situations/rescue). It works fine as we know each other long time but I'm sure that I could do better if I knew what he wants.

My intrusive thoughts are specifically about my friends. I do love them but sometimes when they do something that irks me a little (say like they use their phone while I‚Äôm talking to them face to face or they ghost a message for 2 days) my brain just goes way off tangent. I know us IxFx types are really sensitive to these kind of things. My thoughts then get really suspicious, defensive and resentful. I never really say anything about it, luckily it‚Äôs all in my head but it just eats away at me slowly and it‚Äôs giving me reasons to hate all my friends, who haven‚Äôt done something THAT bad.

He's everything I've wanted in a guy and even more--he's more than I could have hoped for or even dreamed of. He makes me laugh and we just get along well together. We both have a childlike side that we only bring out to people we're really close with, and that's each other. I love that about him. I think he's an ENTP (he took the assessment years ago and can't quite remember), so we are definitely different people--but after four years together, I think we've figured out how to balance each other out pretty well. 

I am having such trouble moving this relationship forward past the boyfriend/girlfriend stage.

I am a caring person - I love him and I look out for him constantly. But I'm also really close with my parents and almost feel that moving my relationship forward with my boyfriend means leaving my parents behind, and I hate that idea.

I am also a really nostalgic person. I think back on my childhood, and even though I know to some extent that I wasn't super happy as a kid and I also couldn't wait to grow up, now I just want it to slow down. I kind of wish I could go back and enjoy my childhood more. It's annoying and I want to let it go, but I feel like I can't.",1563730727

isfj,"Just some thoughts to consider :)

I recently learned that Si is all about layers of comfort. As such, Si+Fe often results in making sure we ourselves and those around us all feel comfortable. The ""mom"" stereotype comes up via this as most info seems to address how xSFJs do things for others and such, however, in group dynamics ISFJs will work to keep everyone *emotionally* comfortable as well. ISFJs want everyone to feel welcome in the conversation and to have their input valued. 

I find myself jumping to the defense of someone who is ""wronged"" against or who might be insecure about something. However, I often handle this in a ""nice"" way where I acknowledge both parties for their worth in order to try and defuse the situation. If there is tension in the air, it makes me uncomfortable so I attempt to reestablish comfort. However, ESFJs with dom Fe are more often able to adjust the ""mood"" and make people naturally ""happy."" If the tension remains within the group, I will leave the situation as I personally can't handle the discomfort. In my experience though, I'm usually decent at moving the conversation into safer territory. 

Si thus seems incredibly powerful in group dynamics. Imagine a small political meeting with an ISFJ making sure all needs are met. Shiz would get done lol 

Honestly though, Si seems undervalued as it's this almost expected thing. People want to have a pleasant conversation overall but if an ISFJ is doing that Si work to help the environment with our tool function Fe, it's not really addressed by anyone. It's like no one notices it apart from ""you're so nice."" (I don't personally feel like the nicest person in life, it's more like if I don't help the situation, I'm unbearably uncomfortable and thus I need to do what's ""right"" to function.) I'm wondering if Si+Fe is almost meant to be a sly pairing in order to make sure things are good all around? 

I guess my problem with Si descriptions is that comfort has a whole range of meanings and uses and as such is pretty complicated. 

--

Someone recently told me that Si doms typically want things ""as they should be,"" which seems to reinforce the SJ traditionalist mindset. However, ""as they should be"" is usually highly personalized and/or connects back to earlier life moments wherein we lived with our family. We have these Si expectations for things and flip the f out if too much Ne uncertainty hits us. If I plan to go to the store but on the way there my tire deflates, I'll likely get some anxiety because it was both unexpected and yet something I couldn't have prepared for apart from carrying tools with me. My Si wants to never have a flat tire and for my car to run as it should. Once all of my ""shoulds"" are in place, I can move beyond my baseline and get interesting things done. 

I don't personally see these ""shoulds"" as traditionalist. What these ""shoulds"" are seem more in line with thinking that the sensory (like my car running right) should be normal and my relationships ""should"" be good/happy/etc. Any deviation from those standards do cause me some stress. One can't have perfection all the time, which may be where tool function Fe comes in: helping others or getting help from others. If the whole goal is sensory and emotional comfort, then it seems we will do what we have to in order to hit that standard. 

Any thoughts on this? :)",1563448815

We have had our moments where we were super close and our moments when we weren't. Our childhood was tumultuous, teen years we were best friends and adulthood has had it's ups and downs. Mostly us putting aside our differences when we need each other and me keeping her at arms length during the in between times.  She always notices the distance, who wouldn't, and passive aggressively talks behind my back until she blows up at me and says really mean, hurtful things that I can't seem to forget no matter how ""good"" we are doing later on. The first time this started she had screwed me over. She was supposed to help me move out of state, bailed last minute with a bad excuse that she couldn't afford it even though I was paying for everything. A couple of weeks later she took a cross country trip that she didn't tell me about until the day she was leaving. While she was gone her best friend died so I sucked it up to be there for her. This has been the cycle ever since with some variations of her going off on me for being distant if someone doesn't die and communication doesn't open up because of that.

The stuff that has happened over our lives hasn't been healthy but we were both wildly immature due to our upbringing. The issue now is that we both want to have our sister back but I've moved across the country,  been in therapy and been working really hard on myself to become a healthy, mature human. She hasn't, she is still a really immature ISFJ. She talks about everyone behind their backs, plays the victim and sees absolutely nothing wrong with herself. It's really obnoxious how highly she speaks of herself and it puts me right back into my own immature behavior which I loathe. I know that she only speaks highly of herself because she is insecure and I see why she is, but I love her unconditionally and she has zero reason to be insecure with me. I'm her sister ffs. 

So please,  any advice to break this cycle is so welcome. Someone close to her just passed and we have been in a good place since then.

I have seen other types develop their inferior function (for example, I have seen ENFJ's develop their inferior Ti, and I have seen ESxP's start to develop their Ni-inferior.)  However, I never hear any talk of how ISxJ's can develop our Ne.  Ne is a function that I've found myself looking for more of in my life as I grow older, and I'm sure that many ISxJ's can relate.  I find myself more fascinated by Ne-dominants (ENxP's) and Ne-auxes (INxP's.)  I formerly regarded NP's as messy and unlike myself, but I find myself wanting to befriend the Ne-users I meet more often now. I've always felt that I have no imagination (which I'm sure has something to do with my lower Ne,) and I felt very insecure about my lack of an imagination as a young child.  ISFJ's, how do you think we should go about developing our Ne?  I've been thinking of trying to make more NP friends, and I've been working on trusting my intuition more often.",1561423074

isfj,"She is very open to confronting me about her woes and I can usually take it in stride but eventually it just builds up inside of me and she will say something in a very annoyed tone and it just gets to me in one way or another.  As the argument progresses it usually gets a lot more heated instead of simmering down and neither of us really budge.  I tend to get more frustrated and raise my voice which causes her to then ignore/dismiss everything I say .  Her reasoning for this is that she views people who are in an emotional state as no longer rational, which I'd say is only half true.  This prompts me to get angrier/more frustrated since I view emotions and raising voice as a vehicle to convey how someone feels.  As I get more and more frustrated; I start to become physically effected and want to get out of the situation and this is usually my breaking point where all my rationality gets thrown out the window.  

&amp;#x200B;

I often used arguments/points of things she did in the past that annoyed me but since I didn't bring them up, because of my non-confrontational nature; she doesn't believe they are fair game and they get thrown out, which is also a point of contention.  I can understand where she is coming from here.  She wants me to be more confrontational with things that annoy me but a lot of the time I don't even realize things annoy consciously because I internally filter it without it passing through my mind and would rather choose that instead of confronting someone.  I am really not sure how to explain why I don't like conflict aside from it causes a physiological response and I can't explain why I prefer not voicing all my annoyances on the spot as they happen.",1561397079

My mom doesn‚Äôt have a life of her own. Whenever I bring this up, she denies it, says she has her own friends ‚Äì she does have a couple of them ‚Äì and the reason she doesn‚Äôt see or talk to them often is because she‚Äôs not a kid anymore and friends aren‚Äôt the center of her life, which is true: her family is.

Now, I have an ISTP(?) and a (shitty) ESFP father and her entire life is centered around the three of us plus her ISFP mom. However, if you guys don‚Äôt know, INFP are extremely independent types. I‚Äôve been WANTING to be independent since I started elementary school and realized all of my friends were somehow less dependent than me: when I was 9, I studied in a school literally right next to my house and my mom insisted in coming pick me up everyday until I exploded and told her I would walk home with my friends, she wanted or not.

Please understand that I KNOW she does this out of immense love for me, her eldest child, and that she‚Äôs afraid I won‚Äôt need her anymore. But it‚Äôs actually doing me more harm than good: I see a psychoanalyst every once in a while and came to the realization that a huge part of why I‚Äôm not really trying to get into college, away from her, is because I‚Äôm so attached to momma. It got worse since my best friend lost her own mother earlier this year and this made me even closer to my mom, with a constant fear that I‚Äôm gonna lose her at any moment.

Sometimes I genuinely wish I had a cold, unloving mother so it would make me desire to leave the house even stronger (I have an awful, terrible father but in contrast....). 

Anyway, I was wondering if any of you have any advice about how to make my mom...detach from me? At least until I get into college? She‚Äôs my biggest supporter but also my biggest glue here. It‚Äôs a complicated situation but I hope one of you can help :)",1561029082

Without spoiling too much, she shows off the best and sometimes worst traits of an ISFJ in an appealing and interesting way. She has intense loyalty to her sister and later the main protagonist.

She's quite a bit stronger than the protag so she essentially acts as his bodyguard. Even when the protagonist is at his worst, she says some incredible things that help the protagonist go through his own development.

So I'm trying to figure out how I use Si exactly and how it works, and I'm still kinda confused. I tried to make observations about myself so here are some:

* If I smell something nice (like fresh cut grass, rain or freshly baked bread). I really focus on the smell and think about how nice it smells, sometimes mention it when I'm with friends.

* I'm very fond of music, I listen to it almost all the time, and if I'm not, I'm usually thinking of a tune or song I remember in my head. If I'm really into it I usually care a bit less about my surroundings and move a bit with the music or lip sync it, even if there are others. And when I'm alone I like to hum along or sing along a bit.

* If I'm reading or watching something I can really get immersed into the story sometimes. If it's really good and it gets emotional, I'll sometimes get quite emotional myself, maybe even cry a bit.

To me these things are very natural, so I'm kinda doubting if this is even an Si thing, it could be that completely misunderstood. What do you guys think? I also wonder how others without Dominant Si experience such things.

She ended up opening up about loads of things in her life, like her relationship with her mother, and asked me loads of questions about me, including whether I wanted kids. I made her laugh loads, like throw her head back laughing, and she said I seemed pretty smart. 

She also said I look older than my age, and how she hates guys her age (I'm nearly 20, she's 17 and a half).

There was a bit of touching when a bee landed on me and she brushed it off, and when one landed on her hair and she asked me to brush it off her. Her body language was positive, lots of playing with her hair, pursing her lips, her body facing towards me, standing close, lots of eye contact....

Maybe I'm just getting soppy now, but I think the way she smiled at me was more genuine  and open than the rare occasions she smiles at other people, when it's usually sarcastic or fake. When other co-workers came in she stopped talking to me, but still made occasional eye contact and smiled, and even teased me about something I said earlier, when the others weren't looking, and immediately after they left, started a new conversation,

So what can I make of all this, was she just being friendly or is there something there? As you can probably guess, I'm crazy about her but I have no idea what she's thinking. There's over a week til I see her again and its driving me mad lol.

No more hard feelings, which is great, but our relationship is bruised and, as he said, we will never be the best of friends again.

My ISFJ girlfriend is transitioning into a leadership/coaching position.

She is currently completely overwhelmed and stressed by this transition, but wants to step up.

How can ISFJs be better leaders/coaches?

I find that she gets very much caught up in the detail, and telling people the specifics, instead of inspiring or guiding them.

Is this basically going to be impossible for ISFJ?

If so, what is the specific blockage?

isfj,"I want to apologize in advance if this ends up becoming somewhat of a rant, but I've been dealing with the situation for a lot longer than I'd like to. And I need to say that I'm in the military so it's not like I can just quit my job, because fuck sake, would I have done that a month ago. 

I'm a 23 m ISTP, currently working nights with only one other person, my supervisor, a 25 m ISFJ.

I recently had him take a test to see his type because I was curious what kind of person would be just so incapable of supervising. 

I also need to point out that this particular ISFJ has to be an outlier for a couple reasons. First, because when I made him take the test (on 16personalities, boohoo bad site is bad) he read the description and said it was accurate except for the friendships part because, and I quote, ""no one enjoys my company"" and ""nearly everyone at work hates me.""
Second, because I have at least some experience with ISFJs, my mom is one, as well as one of my ex's, and both of them are much better people and way easier to deal with. 

Anyway, on to the reason I'm making this post. My isfj supervisor literally does not do any work unless it is absolutely required of him. Him and I are the only two on our shift so I would think that regardless of rank, the workload would be pretty evenly split, or at least split way different than it is now, with me doing legitimately 6 times more work than him. You may ask how I came to 6x, and I'll explain it really quick. I refuel planes, based on how many planes I filled last month (45), and how many he filled (7). 
We have a few other things that we do but it divides basically the same, with him hardly even doing the things that are required of him, and me having to pick up all of the slack for it to not reflect negatively on me. 

Another issue I have with him is personal, because since he has a shitty work ethic, I have no desire to be friends with him, or honestly even talk to him. 

But he'll try to make conversation with me, and I'll give him short (often one word) answers. And then he's like ""Why are you so private?"" To which I've responded ""Why are you so needy?"" 

It's like he thinks that just because we work together for 8 hours a night, and are the only people on shift, that we have to be friends. I realize that he probably thinks I'm just an asshole, which is mostly true, but I'm not about to pretend to be friends with a guy who refuses to even do his fucking job.

I'm extremely close to the point where I'm going to get one of us taken off nights because I can't fucking deal with it anymore. He's been yelled at by our NCOIC (boss) before for not doing his job and making me do all the work, and literally nothing changed at all, it's still the same as it was. 

I guess what I'm looking for is advice? I don't know how to deal with this guy and it's possible it has nothing to do with personality types, but who knows.",1559612234
isfj,"Married ENFP here with my ISFJ spouse. Going on 13 years of what I have considered an easy and comfortable partnership. As an ENFP, I've been ADD with hobbies, intense, and relentless in trying to find new things for us to enjoy either separately or as a couple in order to find a common interest. At the same time, I have also battled with feelings of detachment, while fighting feelings of boredom and a constant feeling that I am being resented for my efforts, even tho that's not the case. This at times made me cold shouldered, and insensitive. I am very sweet according to my ISFJ, but have my moody moments, and after some reflection I came to realize I am not behaving in the way I should be, nor do I like how I act when I am self aware, especially when I slump into 'silent treatment' depressed mode when things have been quiet too long.

After this reflection, I've tried doing a 180 in attitude. I've been helpful around the house, trying to think of anything to chit chat about to keep the conversation alive (to my own detriment most likely), become overly smothering in an effort to be more attentive- but have put my foot in my mouth more times in the last month than our entire time together as I struggle to explain my thinking and concerns. I'm not sure if it's really the case, but it feels like I've done more harm than good.

1) I think it can be hard for my wife to understand why I need to vocalize everything so much. When we have a discussion, I feel that she takes it to heart and thinks that something is wrong when honestly a lot of the time I talk about things just to work through them. I am not really able to process things internally like she can. How can I talk to her in a way that makes her feel more comfortable without thinking something is wrong in the relationship etc?

2) One of the things I love about her is how she is so even keel. My emotions run like a wild rollercoaster all of the time, and I would like to get better at being more consistent with my emotions. I am sensitive and she has said a few times ""you really need to stop worrying"". I think the idea is that everything is fine and I sometimes worry when I don't need to because I am not used to having a partner that is so ""okay"" all the time.

I know some of y'all are still young and haven't started developing this function yet. I believe everyone develops this function at different times in life depending on maturity,health, and life circumstances. Personally, this function has become more conscious for me in my early 20's.

**Tertiary Ti**

* When necessary I can show decent critical thinking skills both in school and life. 
* I value speaking and writing with precision.
* I love Playing analytical games (i.e.,Sudoku or puzzle games) because they keep me mentally stimulated and allow a recreational outlet for my Ti. 
* I have started valuing and building a mini internal logical framework to understand how the world works.
* I like analyzing and researching interesting systems/frameworks like MBTI and building my own personalized understanding of it. 
* I can sometimes lose sight of things and get caught in overanalyzing life and this can sometimes leads to that dreaded Si-Ti loop.

How does POLR Te manifest for you?

Have you found ways in which to improve it that have actually worked (that are not just our other functions mimicking Te)?

In short, Te is generally known as efficiency in achieving , versus Ti which in short, enjoys learning for the sake of learning (true/false, if/thens).

What is your definition/understanding of Te?

For me, Te manifests as: Everything else is WAY more important than Te. I will not break my preferred lifestyle to be efficient, even if that means achievement needs to be pushed back. I refuse to let my day-to-day interests and lifestyle be shoved aside for the sake of efficiency. For example, I weight train 3-5 times per week. I have a hard time rearranging my schedule for this. Meaning, if it's more efficient to stop weight training because it gives me more time to make more money if the goal is getting out of debt, I refuse to do so - because I value my physical health (Si) more. Even though logically I know financial health is a part of that. 

Another example is that I need a lot of transition time between parts of my day. For example, after I complete work, I need down time. After I work out, I need down time, before I commit to transitioning to the next part of my day. Clearly this is inefficient.

In listening to the ISFJ friend, it seems like he wants to be pretty darn clever here. Like he's drawn in by the Ti-temptation to think up a gift himself instead of using the wish list, and sees this as this ""challenge"" where he 1) guesses cleverly (Ti) and 2) in doing so proves he knows the mutual friend very well (Si-Fe).

Knowing mutual friend's pickiness about gifts and her wish list I don't know how this is all going to work. lol. But I really think the cleverness / puzzling it out thing I'm seeing is cool.

Anyway do you guys think this sounds close to how an ISFJ might take on the gifting process? Or is it different for you?

And does anybody appreciate all the work you put into puzzling things out?! Holy cow. Haha.

But she's an ESFP so you can probably guess how that one ended lol. (the big cheat)

I knew we would make a good pair, and that all I had to do was show her a better time (actually listen to and care for her) and she would ditch that asshole. It worked pretty quickly, she broke up with him and we were doing cute little shit the next day, kissing, holding hands, whatever. Then problems arose. She didn't wanna make it official, she pretty much just wanted to fuck, and it was obnoxious. I really liked her, and even though I'm an ENTP and all I'm supposed to want is sex, I really wanted to be something. Eventually I totally gave up, we barely talk now. 

I then took a 6 month break.

technically speaking my ideal matchup should be enfp/entp and even tho they make comfortable friends for me i just have a bit of a hard time relating to their extravertedness or not being super structured. and i dont mean to trash talk, they are great but personally i find myself most benefitting from someone equally structured as i am myself. i also really like people who are able to speak from a really personal standpoint.

and some of the isfj's i met so far have been very attractive to me because of the structure, because i can see who they are rather easily (or at least i think so) but theres 1 thing that seems to get to me. its conflict communication. when dealing with negative feelings there seems to be a bit of a spiral going on. when they hit a bad mood it affects me and when i hit a bad mood it affects them very much. so much so that it seems to be a perpetual thing. fueled by anxiety above all.

isfj,"Basically, I was pissed off at her for leaving me out from an outing and told her to stop 'acting' innocent when I asked her why and wanted to talk to her in private. Admittedly I was pretty brash in confronting her and I don't think she felt like doing it but I did it anyway and told her (not aggressively) that I felt left out by her sometimes. It was the only time I've expressed emotions like that to her so I was expecting some sort of acknowledgement but instead, she withdrew after that.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried talking to her after that in school but her replies were short. She's now interacting with a potential best friend and I don't know what to feel about this. 

&amp;#x200B;

Does she still care? I may have gone too far with expressing my displeasure, so I would understand if she felt threatened. Should I try initiating with her again? I'm not good with being smooth and lively and I don't want to feel unnatural by trying to make her laugh when I'm normally serious.

isfj,"INTJ 17F here. My mum and I bond over our shared hatred for incompetence and big groups of people, but she gets mad at me a lot... usually over how I present/interact with others (no matter how shy she is, she‚Äôs still extremely image-conscious and very traditional) or my complete disconnection from the physical plane (e.g. being directionally challenged, etc). 

Also my way of expressing affection tends to be hit or miss: I‚Äôm a very verbal person, so I tend to talk and open up and make memes a lot if I like you.  Usually, I end up saying something that is a little too dark or offensive or controversial and it‚Äôll start a fight. Bonus points if it‚Äôs on a long drive in the middle of nowhere. 

I‚Äôve tried to mirror what she does ‚Äî she‚Äôs very huggy and helpful when she cares about someone ‚Äî but both of us found it so deeply out-of-character that I dropped it soon after.

isfj,"I'm a teenager. I'm an IXTP and I have an ISFJ friend I consider to be best, but my gut keeps telling me that she's trying to manipulate my feelings. Since elementary school, I just seem to attract FJs like a magnet, but the thing is that I tend to get pissed off since I don't understand why they do the things they do.

This factor is important in this post, because I'm often outwardly angry at this friend, and today I finally confronted her out of anger. Her reaction further proves me right:

When I told her in school that I wanted to talk to her, she looked ""caught"" and finally recovered when she told me ""after the current lesson"" because she needed to ""study"".

Just before the ""talk"", she managed to cut her finger and caused a scene. However, I followed her all the way till she was patched up. I told people that I can handle it after that, and so now I confronted her. Is the incident out of manipulation? I don't know, but I'd say it was a really convenient escape. 

In our three years of friendship, I managed to see her ""caught manipulated"" face only around three times. I wasn't good at expressing feelings, but I wanted to find out what she would say.

So I told her that I felt excluded and left out by her, and asked her why she did the things she did. She explained/excused herself by saying that she didn't know about certain circumstances that made her leave me out. She also mentioned that I seem to talk to another friend, which is why they left me out.

Here's the first post in this series [Introverted Sensing](https://www.reddit.com/r/isfj/comments/bfsxn5/weekend_thread_isfjs_cognitive_functions_dominant/). I'm going to continue tonight with how I use Extroverted Feeling. Before I start, I want to say this is the most important function for us to develop and grow to become a healthy ISFJ (even more important than Si since that allows us to stay in our introverted comfort zone). Here's how I experience Fe. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Auxiliary Fe**

* I'm really good at detecting an emotional atmosphere of environments. I can easily tell if someone seems happy, upset, or sad. 
* I'm really good at reading people's emotions and vibes to know how to change them based on what seems appropriate at the time. 
* I value being supportive and helping out friends and family in times of need. So much so that I can struggle to say no when I'm really busy. 
* I enjoy being able to communicate my values and find common rapport with others.
* I can sometimes struggle to process my own feelings and feel like I need to vent or write them out to be able to understand them better.
* During social gatherings and hanging out with friends, I enjoy helping and seeing everyone getting their needs met. 
* I can absorb other people's emotions easily especially if they are close to me (Ex. If my friend is feeling sad and starts cry, it's super hard for me not to feel sad and cry myself)
* During conflicts or disagreements, I try to mediate between the different parties and strive for ""win win"" scenarios.

isfj,"Hi fellow ISFJ's,

I really feel like I've hit rock bottom, at least by my personal standards.  I've missed a ton of school this year - 14 excused absences (I don't count as a truant because at my school, if they're excused and your grades aren't bad, you can miss a lot) - and I've maintained my GPA, but I'm still shocked that I've only been at school 91% of the school year.  I especially feel bad about this because I'm my math teacher's assistant, meaning a lot of the time I haven't even been there.  This year, I've really been struggling with mental health problems that I haven't wanted to tell anyone about. I've missed school because of family problems. Going to school makes me feel awful because I just cut off some friends who I knew for a long time, and every time I'm there I remember how little they care about me and it makes me feel like I wasted so much time on them.  I struggle to feel safe and happy in a school environment knowing that I'm being judged by my peers all of the time.  I don't really even dislike learning or the idea of education, I just don't feel motivated to go there every morning because I feel a lot of my coursework is easy and I'm at a point where I think my depression has been affecting my attendance and my willingness to really interact with my peers.  

My goal this summer is to really motivate myself and find *reasons* for doing things I don't want to do, and really nip those reasons in the bud.  So, ISFJ's: what motivates you to wake up in the morning?  Why do you go to work, and why do you go to school?  What drives you to want to succeed?  What have you done when you haven't found success?",1557814218

isfj,"Hi guys, I posted this elsewhere, but wanted to ask for your advice because I think ISFJs give really good advice. Also because we are a bit different personality types, I‚Äôd love to hear your perspective. 

There was a guy I met almost two years ago. It wasn‚Äôt exactly love at first sight, but very close. I had never met anyone I felt this intensely about, even though I have loved people in the past. When we were together, it felt like time stopped. I remember going on a date with him and not being able to say much becsuse I couldn‚Äôt stop staring at him.

He was in a really bad place, as was I. We were both struggling with depression and both had just gotten out of shitty relationships. He was closed off and impulsive and I was clingy. We were on again and off again for a bit until I called it off, but I regretted it the minute that I did. We‚Äôve since moved on with other people, but for me, I have never met someone else who made me feel the way he did. Dating feels like work because I have to constantly convince myself to keep giving guys a shot. For awhile I was preoccupied with other people but recently I‚Äôve been remembering him more and more. And when my married friends talk about how they felt when they met the one, it mirrors the feelings I had for him. We‚Äôve run into each other a couple of times and each time the feelings have been just as intense.

We didn‚Äôt end things well. He told me that the way I was acting was pushing him away. Over the years I have done much better and am now very much the confident, kind and calm person I‚Äôd like to be. I know that if I met him now, I would have handled the situation much differently.

He‚Äôs moved out of the city after graduating from his masters program, but is starting a job in a nearby town. If he‚Äôs not still with the girl I saw him with last winter, I know dating will be really hard for him in the middle of nowhere. I have been considering reaching out to him, but I don‚Äôt know what to say. Has anyone done this and what happened? Has anyone found peace another way and moved on? I never thought I would still be thinking of him almost two years later, but I think he was really special to me and I feel like I will only live once and don‚Äôt want to live in regret for so much of it. He‚Äôs and ESFP and I‚Äôm an ENFP if that matters.

isfj,"Hey guys, TL;DR at the bottom. Sorry for the long read. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently in grad school and about 7 months ago, I got into my first ever romantic relationship. I poured my heart out for this girl and if she ever needed anything, whether that be emotional support or anything else, I dropped everything I was doing to help her. She is the first woman I kissed and I lost my virginity to her. 

&amp;#x200B;

She had thoughts that I'm not into the relationship or that I just view her as a platonic friend, but each time I (and I'm not lying when I said this) I ensured her that I truly cared for her. She (somewhat infrequently) had doubts about us but time and time again I was there for her and ensured her that I wanted to be with her because of her and not because she's the first woman I've been with. Even in the moments where she questioned the relationship, if she was in need of emotional support, I was still there for her. At one point she even asked me why I stuck around with her, and I told her that I saw the good in her and I wanted to be with her. 

&amp;#x200B;

Cut to mid-April last month, and these feelings came up again and this time we sort of broke it off. We talked, texted, and hung out still. I even spent the night two nights in a row at her place during this time because she was feeling emotional but she explicitly told me it didn't mean anything. We didn't have sex but we did kiss. 

&amp;#x200B;

The very next week, after we didn't see each other on the weekend, I hung out with her again on Monday. We were still kinda ""broken up"" but I went to her place after classes and ate dinner and watched TV in her bedroom. We kissed and almost had sex but we stopped because she said it wouldn't be right. She then essentially asked me if I love her, and I responded that I do. I've been in love with her for a while, I just kept those feelings to myself because I was scared that she didn't feel the same way, so I never told her. But I told her that I do love her, and she said, ""I think I love you, too."" I spent the night with her for the next three days and we constantly said I love you to each other. On Wednesday night, while we were having sex, I told her how much I loved her as I held her hands, but she was having her period so we stopped (she said its nothing I did wrong). 

&amp;#x200B;

Cut to Thursday. We wake up and I go home for the day while she goes to school. Thursday night, she, a close friend (a male who she frequently hangs out with one-on-one) of hers, me, and a good buddy of mine go out to a bar. She was fine in the beginning, but as she drank more, she got very cold towards me, and would smile at her close friend. My buddy asked her how she and I were doing, and she replied ""ehhhhhh."" Throughout the night, if I said anything to her, she would push me away, tell me to fuck off, and then smiled at her close friend. When I asked if I could walk her home, she said, ""no, close friend can walk me home."" (they live in the same apartment right by the bar we went to.) So I went to hug her goodbye and she gave me this awkward side hug. I was feeling very down after this and my buddy and I talked about it. I didn't sleep the entire night.

&amp;#x200B;

The very next day, at 7:30, she texts me and then calls me asking if my buddy talked to me after I left as to what happened that night. I told her we did. After a 30-minute conversation, she broke up with me (she said that drunk words are sober thoughts, so when she said ""ehhh"" to my buddy, that's how she truly felt). I was in tears, so about three hours later, I texted her asking if we could actually talk in person. She was hesitant but she obliged.

&amp;#x200B;

When we met up, I told her how she treated me at the bar and she immediately started shaking (we talked in her car). We drove a short bit and as I was talking about what she did, she had to stop driving because she couldn't stop shaking. For the next three hours, we talked and I was confused as to why she felt this way despite her saying I love you to me only three days prior. I told her that she smiled at her close friend every time she told me to ""fuck off,"" but she said she wants nothing to do with him and that she's never cheated on me (I believe her when she says this about the cheating). Essentially, she told me she said she loves me as well that because she was feeling lonely. Her feelings about being not sure about us went away when I told her I loved her, but after Thursday the warm fuzzies came back. She said she gets the ""warm fuzzies"" when she talks to one of her ex-boyfriends (i'm aware that she still talks to him and I don't care) but she also gets warm fuzzies when she talks to her close friend that I mentioned earlier (despite her saying she wants nothing to do with him when I told her that she smiled at him the entire night). She said she doesn't know what she wants and that she is going to date around this summer (she asked me if I'd be okay with it and I said I don't care what you do) and she asked me to date around as well. I told her no, I'm not going to date around. It will take a long time to get over my feelings for you.) She asked me to hate her, to call her a bitch, to be mad at her, etc., bit I told her despite all of this, I'm still in love with her. She wanted to stay friends because she said, ""I'm one of the few people who get her,"" and I obliged because I truly appreciate her as a human being and care for her. She dropped me off and that's that.

The next couple of days, we barely talked to each other. One day, (as we are going through finals) texted me telling me how stressed out she is. I texted her back and after a bit of back and forth, she felt better. Later that night, she texts me again that she's stressed out, and she FaceTimed me in tears with how stressed out she was. I comforted her and I told her I'm always here for you and I stayed on FaceTime with her until she fell asleep. After that, more radio silence. Then again she texts me how stressed she is and I agree to go get food with her to calm her down. This happened two days in a row. She called me the second night stressed again and I talked her through it and made her feel better. 

&amp;#x200B;

Two days ago from today, she texts me if I'm at school studying and if she could bunker up with me for the day. I said sure. We studied for a bit but more or less talked throughout the day. She asked me if she could download Hinge and Bumble on my phone (as an ISFJ, this made me chuckle) and I told her I'm kinda uncomfortable with it because I don't know how I feel. She told me she appreciates what we have (Friendship) and that she doesn't want anything else. I told her OK maybe I will date this summer, and we just talked about how our relationship was in the beginning (with me being awkward, not making the move to kiss her, etc.) She asked if I wanted to go on a walk with her, so we did, and we talked about personal stuff from our past and our goals for the future.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday, we went on another walk and had a casual conversation. There was an end-of-the-year party last night, and she asked if I was going. I was (most of my good friends weren't going) so I talked with people who I wasn't close with. She got there and she was kind of cold towards me, and flirty with her close friend I mentioned earlier. Some person I briefly talked to sort of flirted with me but I was just so shut down from it I felt bad and I went home immediately after.  I told her bye and she just gave me a high-five.  I saw her walking back alone with that close friend.  Just now (right before I made this post) she called me while I'm studying and asked if she could just vent. She apologized for bothering me and I told her no, so she vented for about 10 minutes, then hung up. 

&amp;#x200B;

SO FINALLY, this is my predicament I still feel strongly for her. I still love her. The days where we barely talk suck, but the days I get to see her and talk with her feel good. Even if she's talking about how she's stressed, I still feel great just talking to her and listening to her problems and making her feel better. When I saw her being flirty with the close friend (who she again says she wants nothing to do with), it ate away at my heart. I poured my heart out for her (and I feel like I continue to do so), despite everything that's happened. I feel exhausted and my heart bleeds every single day for her, but I keep answering the phone and wanting to see her because I can't distance myself. I'm just so exhausted, both physically and mentally. I get no sleep. I need to put myself first for once but I literally just cannot. I cannot bear the pain I would possibly bring her by making her feel alone. 

WHAT DO I DO??? 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR My first girlfriend ever at the age of 24 broke up with me because she doesn't know how what she wants (despite telling me how happy I make her and that I'm always there to emotionally support her) but she still calls/texts me for emotional support/when she's feeling stressed.

How about you guys?",1557032072
isfj,"Hi friends. This is a story all about how I‚Äôd like to figure an ISFJ out. Ha.

For starters - not sure if he is even an ISFJ, but it seems most likely given that he is pretty active/consistent in our faith community groups, has a lot of female friends, and seems to be introverted and a sentinel, but not a T (I am a female ISTJ).

Ok, so we‚Äôll call him Fox for the sake of anonymity. We got introduced by a mutual friend who we both know from church and a co-ed young adults bible study. 

Over the next couple of weeks I tried my ISTJ hardest to give subtle but observable signals that I was interested and made a point to accept the invitations to hang out with him and his group of female friends and went to more of the events for the young adult group.

I was getting mixed signals and almost got the vibe that he wanted me to chase him. So then I decided to just move on... met this other guy who is naturally more my type (physically and personality-wise), and decided I liked him instead of Fox. Partially bc Fox has a lot of girl friends and at least one of them obviously liked him, and also because I was losing patience with his shennanigans. 

Just as I decided not to be interested (bc ISTJs often decide what to do with our feelings based on logic), Fox started showing more interest.

Perceived interest includes: intentionally seeking me out in crowds, inviting me to all the group things, opening up and sharing personal information about himself and his family, and most noticably seeming super high energy and a little bit like a spaz the last time I saw him when our other friends hadn‚Äôt shown up yet and it was just the two of us.

In the course of all this I did some introspecting and realized that in the long run, he actually is a better fit, and that if he is interested I would like to stop actively friend-zoning him and see what naturally develops. (I was somewhat blowing him off emotionally because I could tell he was warming up to me and I didn‚Äôt want to hurt him by going along with his openness and asking follow up questions about the personal info he shared since I had decided I wasn‚Äôt interested... I feel like there‚Äôs too much chemistry and potential for us to HONESTLY be just friends without one us catching feelings.)

So yesterday I got his number from a mutual friend bc I was going to be closer to his area, and wanted to see if he wanted to meet up for lunch or coffee. We‚Äôve only ever hung out with other people that I didn‚Äôt know well and I am interested in seeing what a 1:1 dynamic is like.

So I was like ‚ÄòHey, this is me from church, etc. How‚Äôs it going?‚Äù And that was 4:24 PM on Friday and after a couple hours went by I figured he might be busy with work since he has a big boy job. By 11AM on Saturday I was kinda salty he didn‚Äôt reply. So then I sent a follow up that said, ‚ÄúSorry, do I have the wrong number?‚Äù  

And he was like, ‚ÄòHey AgathaaJane! Sorry I‚Äôm just now getting back to you. I‚Äôm at a bachelor weekend. This is Fox.‚Äù And put a thumb‚Äôs up emoji. 

Which, I now remember he mentioned the bachelor weekend/his roommate getting married in conversartion last weekend while I was still deciding not to like him. Ha.

I can give more deets if it would be helpful, but this is hella long as is. 

Him getting back to me and giving a reason for the delay could just be politeness, but given the other behaviors I am wondering how to proceed... are there ways to suss out if an ISFJ guy likes you or is just well-mannered and includes you in his vast circle of female acquaintances? 

I have realized that I should proably just be my authentic self and not try to manage his feelings during our interactions (esp since I‚Äôm neither intuitive nor feeling ...just observant and analytical). I‚Äôm not opposed to being direct, but would appreciate input as to the likelihood of him being interested.",1557020231
isfj,"Sometimes I read the threads and wonder if I‚Äôm a true ISFJ. (At the same time I understand this subreddit is an extremely small community compared to other MBTI groups)

One thing I‚Äôve been constantly doing in my life is confrontations. Whenever I feel hurt by a close friend, I always confront eventually. Sometimes the confrontations bring us closer, other times, the friendship ends. I never intended the confrontation to end the friendship, but was also ready for the consequences. 

I just had another confrontation because I really don‚Äôt want to think or feel badly of a friend. The idea of the friendship ending does sadden me, but I think it will help me move on better worst case scenario.

isfj,"If we work on the E/I dichotomy of Jung, Se would essentially be ""collecting"" sensations of intensity. A major drive to do so.

How does Si work?

isfj,"I sometime do this thing where I will relive past memories and feel the emotions that I felt then. I know that this is si but, the thing is, my memories seem to go in different directions. For example I relived a conversation that I had with my friend a couple of years ago and the answers he gave were different. I was reliving the conversation but I was also making up new scenarios at the same time and feeling new emotions. It came to the point where I could no longer distinguish the made up parts with the real parts. This may sound harmless but the scenarios can become extremely nasty. This just doesn't happen with conversations either. My brain will sometimes inject whatever I am thinking about in the present or something completely made up and put it into the past and make up new memories. When I was younger I would sometimes actually think that these made up memories actually happened. I am better at distinguishing fantasy and reality now, thankfully. Is this normal or am I just crazy or something? A couple years ago, when my mental health was not so great, my brain used these tactics to basically make me believe some really weird totally made up and borderline fantastical things about my childhood.

So far, we've been on just one date and I'm quite sure our communication styles are similar (concrete and present). But I'm curious if an ISFJ's decision-making process is similar to an ISTJ's, 

My dominant Si means that I tend to sponge up information which then marinates in my mind for a while so that my Fi has ample time to make sense of it all. This means that when it comes to deciding on how I feel about someone, especially in a romantic sense, I require lots of personal time (could be days or weeks) to reflect on the experiences that I had with the person in question.

With Si being the ISFJ's dominant function as well, do you operate in a similar manner of requiring time for your Ti to introspect and make sense of an experience that you had?",1556725154

1. I‚Äôm insecure (also goes for work)
2. I‚Äôm neurotic and tend to catastrophize in my head (also in platonic relationships, afraid that I‚Äôm a turn off after saying something wrong)
3. I need to feel loved in order to feel comfortable around my partner",1556566307
isfj,"So something that has been confusing me lately is the idea of Fe being used to help Si dominance. 

As I understand it, while Se seeks to collect the sensations of a ""thing"", the Si dominant tends to assume they know what the thing feels like and perceived into that assumption to reference a primordial image. To put this into a real life context, imagine I put a SUPPPPPER fluffy blanket in a room with an Si dominant and an Se dominant. The Se dominant is gonna be overtaken with energy and motivation to feel the blanket and to ""collect"" the ""data point"" i.e. what it feels like.

&amp;#x200B;

The Si dominant on the other hand will look at it and pretty much assume they know what it feels like. They might want to feel it around them, but only because they have an idea of what it feels like and they might want that at the time. The Se user doesn't presume to know what it feels like until they feel it. Sometimes the Si user is wrong, and they will experience a sensation from the blanket and their world will be thrown for a loop because it ""doesn't feel like it's supposed to."" The other element of Si is that they are referencing internal models of things like fluffiness. How do these internal models present themselves to you?

&amp;#x200B;

Secondly, how does Fe help you? How does it help you communicate Si to others, how does it help you achieve Si goals or means?",1556546640

He has a flirty nature so I never expected anything out of that; I was just there for the good time. I told him I didn't want to label our flirty rls as anything (to avoid the pressure of getting boxed into one thing) but he was insistent that it be labeled for his peace of mind and so fwb it became.

**Dominant Si**

* Go to for everything and can do this in my sleep. I'm constantly comparing and contrasting between past and present without even thinking about it. 
* Highly aware of internal bodily sensations. Like hunger, thirst, and fatigue. I don't think I could let a whole day past without eating or drinking. 
* Great memory for facts and details that made an sense impression on me. (Ex. If I value a relationship with someone I will make an effort to remember most of the facts and details about them.). Common misconception is that dominant Si users have a photographic memory this is false and I tend to remember the facts and details that made an personal impression on me. 
* Highly aware of changes in my sensory environment and think about the potential positive or negative impact the changes have on me. 
* My brain is similar to internal filing cabinet and all of the important facts and details are in their proper place. 
* I enjoy creating career plans because I want my future to be similar to the good memories of past or even better than the past. 
* When I learn about a subject, I can break learning down into manageable and sensible steps to learn the information in an effective manner. 
* Overtime, able to become an expert in a subject due to incremental learning over time.

So I have an ISFJ friend who I thought I had great (platonic) chemistry with at the beginning of this year (we were basically best friends), but as we became closer, she slowly began to devolve into this little-sister type character.

isfj,"Hi all, 26F ISFJ here. Recently, I have been wondering if I am demisexual. I've been single for about a year and a half, and during this time, I've felt little to no sexual attraction towards anyone. Following my last relationship (4 years with a close friend I had known since elementary school), I have been extremely uncomfortable with the idea of ""putting myself out there"" and dating people to get to know them. I did try Tinder for a few weeks, but found it extremely unfulfilling and felt it put a lot of pressure on me. All of my relationships have been with people I had been friends with first.

The idea of a life-long monogamous relationship is so attractive to me - I want to be able to put all of my trust and love and companionship towards someone who will reciprocate those feelings. However, I find that I struggle to find other people worthy of my trust or this kind of commitment..? 

(Not to sound conceited but) I've had many people show interest in me since I became single, and I just find that I'm totally disinterested, to the point that I'm then extremely uncomfortable around these people who show interest. I can't figure out if this is me being emotionally unavailable or something different. Recently, a coworker of mine told me that she knows someone who likes me, and I visibly cringed at the thought. 

I hadn't been concerned with being single at all, since I'd rather take care of myself than try to force interest in someone I don't know, but I attended a party recently where I was the only person not in a marriage or LTR. I felt so alone, and it's making me think a lot about if I can/should be more accepting or open-minded.

First it was, ‚Äúshe doesn‚Äôt talk to people like us.‚Äù When that doesn‚Äôt work, bc I‚Äôm always cordial with them it became ‚Äúesta loca‚Äù, ‚ÄúElla no esta justo en la cabeza‚Äù (she‚Äôs not right in the head). She also goes to a huge group of open cubicles about 50 ft away and talks laughs about me on her way out. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so weird, etc etc‚Äù

Results:
I brought it to HR‚Äôs attention with mixed results. While 85% of the convo was her saying it was unacceptable unprofessional behavior that had to stop. There was a good 10-15% of the convo where her language flip-flopped and became more supportive of my coworker and more blamey of me. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs not a bad person. I‚Äôm sure if she just understands the pain and upset she‚Äôs causing you‚Äù.  Meanwhile, reference was made to ‚Äúanti-social behavior‚Äù on my part ‚Äúdo I see how this could‚Äôve happened if I don‚Äôt speak to people‚Äù. To be clear I‚Äôm cordial to everyone and cover the basics of according honor and respect. I‚Äôm just not the kind who hangs out at desks or makes a lot of small talk. Depending on the personality that occasionally gets twisted to into my not being ‚Äúkind‚Äù. The phrase was also used ‚Äúwell you let it escalate this far‚Äù. So I‚Äôm not sure of them being 100% on my side, just not wanting to get sued. 

Options:
There are 3 options. 1. HR can speak with her alone. I shot down this option bc HR hasn‚Äôt been squarely 100% on my side and a little bit blaming of me and excusing of her. I also see in her tone when discussing me with others that she feels self righteous and justified. She always tries to make out two things. I don‚Äôt speak to her and that I swear too much. Both of which are huge exaggerations. I cover the basics but am not overly chatty with her as I see how ready she is to put a knife in my back. I swear under my breathe occasionally. Not any more than anyone else on that floor and certainly not at anyone but I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôll become me being ‚Äúhostile. And swearing at her etc‚Äù bc that‚Äôs how I‚Äôve heard her recount it in private convos in the office next door. I won‚Äôt let her sit with HR alone bc it‚Äôs sure to be a mud slinging fest where she tries to turn them and they may be open to being turned.

Second option is me, her and HR. A mud slinging fest once again but one in which I get to defend myself. Also, despite anti-retaliation policies which ensure firing for anyone who talks about having been brought before HR. she‚Äôs sure to run to the lady who sits next door to me, her best friend and other people on the floor with she‚Äôs been treated so badly by me. I had her dragged before HR, which they will regard as a fighting mean thing to do. She involved HR?! If she gets fired I‚Äôm still the bad guy and divisions which have already popped up on the floor based on her saying I don‚Äôt talk to her will be worse.

Third option is, I take her to lunch (which she really doesn‚Äôt deserve) and talk it out. I said I would take the third option bc I think it does the least professional damage to me and allows me to avoid standing in a completely bad light in front of HR. I can already tell she‚Äôs gonna yell, she‚Äôs so emotionally invested in having been ‚Äúmistreated‚Äù by me. Yet she is the only one keeping this going by going around to person after person. I basically just sit there. There‚Äôs nothing she can point to to say I‚Äôve harmed her and we don‚Äôt work together, can totally exist without interaction so I don‚Äôt know why she‚Äôs continuing to make this a big deal. It‚Äôs gonna be ‚ÄúI was so nice to you when you showed up. I offered to help you. I shared snacks with you and you don‚Äôt talk to me. You curse all days and are so nasty and hostile. (I don‚Äôt. I could call several of her friends to corroborate the fact that she talks about me having a mental illness like it‚Äôs a matter of fact. She would be hard pressed to find anyone aside from the two attorneys she supports to say that I curse. And they‚Äôd say anything to keep her on. She also stands right at the desk with one of them and speculates about me having a mental illness openly right while I sit that. I‚Äôm so crazy. They‚Äôre not sure what my boss saw in me. He must not know me like they do‚Äù) The last argument will be, You don‚Äôt even speak to me. I‚Äôm so mistreated‚Äù. these are the arguments that will come up. One ace I have is the partner I work for. He‚Äôs a hurricane. One of the strongest litigators around and impossible to hold your own against. HR is terrified of him and his involvement. I‚Äôve told him what‚Äôs going on, even though I didn‚Äôt want to bc it places a question mark over me. Hes contacted HR asking if he needs to be involved. They were like no. They‚Äôre scared of him and have good reason to be. The attorneys my coworker supports are not as powerful and not as strong in argument as him. He‚Äôs a complete pitbull. Hes confided in me that he needs to preserved the working relationship with aggressors attorneys though. So moving her is not an option. From that I assume neither is going totally nuclear. 

How do you all suppose I can handle this in a way that is professional, minimizes damages and shuts her gossiping down.

Tl:dr- tasked with taking coworker who‚Äôs been calling me bipolar/ retarded/ mentally ill to lunch to talk things out. She will say I‚Äôm hostile curse too much and don‚Äôt speak to her. What should I say to handle this in a professional way that minimizes damage and shuts her gossiping down.",1555261214

isfj,"Hey! First time post here. I am 100% an ISFJ, and am just wondering if other ISFJs have similar attributes: 

1. I have zero imagination, and never really have. Even as a child I don't remember much imaginative play. 

2. I really don't have any interests or curiosity in the world. I am very practical and don't really live outside that.

3. I am awful at remembering movies, TV shows or books. Even if I've seen them/read them more than once. I know if I like/dislike them, but otherwise can't remember specific details or character names. 

4. Day to day, my thoughts, inner voice, whatever you want to call it doesn't really think or say too much. For example, if I'm at the grocery store, that's what I'm thinking about - finding x ingredient. If I'm in the car, I'm just driving.  

5. Intimately, I feel the same kind of flat line. I more or so do it because I know it makes my partner feel satisfied and loved. I only feel this drive, the want for physical intimacy, probably 1-2 times per month. 

Bottomline, is I feel like a flat line and boring. And when I look at everyone else, I know they are living richer more interesting lives.

You guys never seem to ever have a conversation, when I talk to you and ask hey what‚Äôs going on there is nothing. It feels like he is nervous to say the wrong thing. I don‚Äôt get it. I would love to hear about what you‚Äôve read about or some current affair that‚Äôs going j in the world just to spark conversation.

What are questions that you like to be asked that ‚Äúgive you the permission‚Äù to keep talking without second guessing whether you want to be heard or if you‚Äôre boring the other person? 

We go out every week for a walk so she can take a breather and stretch her legs (she doesn‚Äôt exercise much). But sometimes I feel like she wants to say something or express something but she ALWAYS holds back. I don‚Äôt know how to conduct myself in a manner that conveys ‚Äúlet your hair down‚Äù. I mean, I do know how to conduct myself but‚Äî- there‚Äôs a lot she‚Äôs bottling up. 

*Backstory*
Yes, I love her. We talked about it. She doesn‚Äôt feel the same way. She one of a kind and I still want her in my life for as long as possible. 
We go out every so often and have a great time. 
About 2 years ago, I thought we could be something special but another girl came into my life and I started dating her (the new girl). We thought we would get married. My ISFJ friend told me later after we broke up that she cried so hard when I attempted to move away to another state with this new girl. 
When I asked her why, she said she was going to miss our friendship. ü§®?
I‚Äôve tried to move on out of our city to bigger and better things (we just graduated  college) but things didn‚Äôt take off as planned. 
I fear I have conducted myself in a manner that leads her to believe that I‚Äôm not consistent. I‚Äôve assured her that I don‚Äôt want to leave and I‚Äôm no longer planning to (another long story): this conversation took place 2017. 
We just started going on these walks last September. 


My backstory is spotty (and maybe unnecessary?), but I can fill in the gaps with questions. 

We talk about all kinds of things, but none of her fears. 
She‚Äôs an enneagram 6 if that matters. 

Also: is there anything else you suggest I can do now that I‚Äôve shared this backstory?

When we go out, we just walk on the track, chit chat about nothing, grab frozen yogurt here and there, and go to the movies.",1554851163

My younger ISFJ brother just turned 17 and is due to finish high school in November (I know it's weird, we're Australian lol). The thing is, he has no idea what he wants to do with his life and I can tell it's really stressing him out. Our parents are big pushers for a university education, which means he has just under 5 months to pick a course. He wants to pick a career he really loves, something that he's passionate about and doesn't feel like work every day. The thing is, he's struggled in the past with depression and he doesn't feel passionate about anything. He has considered doing teaching, design, nursing, and carpentry but he's decided against all of those. 

I'm currently working towards a career in healthcare (hopefully I'll be a doctor one day! Or maybe I'll go into research or something I have no idea yet lol) and I consider myself lucky because I always knew what field I wanted to work in. I feel really helpless towards him in this situation. I've suggested he go into a field like counselling because it would utilise that Fe but he's super introverted and says he doesn't think he could deal with people all day. I also suggested to him doing an Arts or Business degree because he's really creative and Business and English are his two best subjects, but he's worried they might lead him to a dead end job he hates. He's really big on the passion thing. 

Anyway, I need some advice from fellow ISFJs because I just do not understand you at all, you think so differently to us! Even if you can't offer advice I'd also love to hear what career you are currently in and how you came to be there.

tl;dr 17 yo ISFJ brother needs to pick something for his uni applications in 5 months. Help! ",1554616517
isfj," I'm a female INFP and I've had a female ISFJ friend for a while now. We have the same sense of humor and have a lot of weird/funny inside jokes. She's always asking me to hang out with her, and most of the time when we hang out we just talk about a whole bunch of random shit and get a meal together. Sometimes I get the feeling she doesn't like me though, but Idk if it's just me being overly sensitive lol. She can be very straightforward irl, but it's hard to tell if she's joking or not through chat, especially. She never says anything mean though. Sometimes she'll tell our other friend that no one likes her or call her an autist (that friend ended up being diagnosed with asperger's though, so my ISFJ friend stopped saying it LOL). Basically, she's just a blunt person and makes fun of people easily. I wonder if she ever does it behind my back, I hope not :p

edit: Should add more about her. We're going to Disneyland tomorrow and she's the only one in my friend group who is giving a fuck about my allergies. I'm allergic to gluten, dairy, and soy. She researched for food that I can eat at Disneyland and chose a restaurant that has a menu that won't kill me. Pretty glad she did that cuz I was just going to drink water and eat fruit for the whole day l o l. (Is this part even important to add? I heard ISFJ's just naturally take over the motherly role, so this paragraph might not mean much?)

So does she see me as an actual friend or nah?",1554612073

isfj,"Yesterday an ISFJ (male) asked me (ENTJ female) to be his girlfriend. We‚Äôre both mid to late 20s and career professionals. We were friends for a few years, had a fling, then it became more serious over time. It‚Äôs been a slow burn. 

As an ENTJ, I kind of need emotional stuff spelled out to me, and I need data to pull on ‚Äî so your feedback is really helpful. Thank you in advance. I‚Äôm here to seek advice on this match-up. How do I best make this work? I‚Äôm looking for ENTJs and ISFJs to give input and feedback on their experience, and others to chin in if you have input. 

In the past I‚Äôve dated an ENTP, INTP, INTJ, and ISTP. So his personality type is way out of my wheelhouse. In the past I‚Äôve fallen super hard, but this has been a slow burn. Nothing crazy, no falling, but consistently enjoyable, good sex, attraction, we have a lot of fun together and align on equal levels of productivity. Be both enjoy structure and family. I am more of the natural leader and as I‚Äôve warmed up to him and started to push him to grow, to ‚Äúmaximize‚Äù his potential. This has been a sticking point at times until he had an ‚Äúaha!‚Äù Moment and realized this was my way of growing closer to him. I hadn‚Äôt thought about it like that, but it‚Äôs true. I do that when I‚Äôm close to someone. 

I love how he notices all of the details of who I am, grapples with them because they are hard for him to digest. Then understands and accept them, therefore accepting and loving me. It‚Äôs feel like he‚Äôs really thought about me, and then made this decision. 

I will say, though, that it hasn‚Äôt been easy getting to this point. We miscommunicate frequently, it‚Äôs taken him a long time to accept my TE as getting close to him and not criticism, and to me he‚Äôs very sensitive in nature to the point of frustration because he won‚Äôt stand firm in his opinion, isn‚Äôt a natural leader, and won‚Äôt dive deep on emotional issues, experience or personal history. It feels superficial compared to other connections I‚Äôve had. 

This has made me hesitant to commit to him. But my intuition has been prodding me to commit because I wonder if at the end of the day we will actually be a much stronger partnership than someone I may have more natural chemistry with ‚Äî because he is so loving and supportive of me, he holds the family life together and is the supportive foundation I need to achieve my very lofty and intense career goals (that I am already on track for). 

Also, unlike my previous relationships, the physically connection is 100% there. I would say the intellectual sparring, ideation, dreaming, and back-and-forth conversation is not. ALTHOUGH, I have seen him grown in these areas while dating, just as I have become more considerate of others and what they need in my decision making. 

I‚Äôve justified my involvement with him as a great opportunity for grow my weakest areas, but now that he‚Äôs asked me to commit, I think it needs to be more than an experiment. I need to care for him, and make the relationship a goal of mine (that‚Äôs how I operate), and I‚Äôm wondering if this is the right pairing to do that with....or if this will just end tragically. 

Last note - I‚Äôm keeping in mind that mbti is just a generalization and not and end-all-be-all, but I will say the S vs N thing has held pretty true from what I‚Äôve seen. Also worth noting, we both don‚Äôt like being vulnerable and that has also been part of our inability to go deep with each other.

Two biggest reasons why I‚Äôve yet to change job: 1. The benefits this job/employer provides, 2. I think people are generally decent/nice at my office yet I‚Äôm still struggling, what if the next job is worse?

With four people sitting there and telling me that I was fake, annoying, and needed to change my fashion and myself to hang out with them, I really believed all of them.  I thought that they were correct, and everything was my fault.  I blamed myself immediately.  I wanted to die.  I felt like I'd never find people who liked me.  Most of all, I felt alone.  I didn't want to bother my parents with my pain, my friend group had revealed to me that they'd bee talking about me and hated me, and they had told me to not tell my other friends what happened because they ""already get enough hate.""  I called the National Suicide Hotline because I urgently needed to hear another voice on the phone... to know that I wasn't losing my mind.  As stupid as this may sound, I told the man on the other line what happened, and how I felt.  I admitted to him that I worry frequently about what others think of me, and that I feel a strong need to take care of others to assure that they never feel the way I do.  The man on the other line said something to me that really changed my mind: ""Caring about other people is a great quality to have.  But you're a person, and it's not bad to put yourself first.  The girls who started texting you aren't the only people in the world.""

And that really did change my way of seeing things.  I've been working on developing a stronger sense of self.  I've realized that I am **stronger** than I thought myself to be.  I am more capable than I had thought.  I feel like I'm developing a sense of confidence.  I've realized that everyone I meet isn't a good person.  I've reflected, and recognized that I've been walked over many times.  I'm not going to be mean to people.  But I'm going to stop letting other people decide who I am for me, and putting me down.  I'm no longer a pushover.  I'm a person, and I have people in my life who like me.  I'm going toward those people instead of toward those who don't have my best interests at heart.

I have tested as an ISFJ pretty consistently (only one test out of 8 gave me INFJ, dunno how). Reading various books about personality theory, and browsing the internet definitely confirms me as an ISFJ. I‚Äôve seen people get sad about their ‚Äúdiagnosis‚Äù as an ISFJ but for me honestly things just kind of clicked like OK, makes sense, and really helped me in my road to self-acceptance. However...

Especially the internet seems to propagate ISFJs as saints, working our butts of to make this world a better place and bending over backwards to be of service whenever and wherever possible. They do not gossip, are always kind and friendly and are a delight to be around. Who wouldn‚Äôt love an ISFJ? Well, while I do consider myself very considerate of others‚Äô needs, and I‚Äôm a quite caring and loving individual, I am not as altruistic as ISFJs seem to be perceived. I am quite salty and cynical and by no means aspire to make the world a better place. I do not volunteer, I do not donate and I‚Äôm pretty OK with that.

I've been getting more into the functions and working on typing myself according to them. I identify a lot with the description for ISFJs, but very VERY much don't with others. Like, some of the descriptions I come across I'm pretty strongly against. 

I think the biggest one I go against the grain on for it is wanting to fall in line with traditional behavior or beliefs, or feeling like procedures are in place for a reason. I disagree strongly with this. I very much hate listening to authority because they probably know what they're doing.

On all the websites I've been on, they all say that ISFJ's are kind and empathetic people. Although I feel like I'm the least empathetic out of all of my friends (most of them don't have Fe in their stacks) and it makes me question whether or not I'm an ISFJ or not.

They told me I dress like I'm 10, and that they created a new group chat to get away from me.  They said they still want to be friends with me, just ""not close friends.""  I've found new people to sit with at lunch, but I feel like the way they handled things was ridiculously harsh.  I hadn't even known that they had all these problems with me.  Some people told me I should cut them off.  I'm glad that I have other people around me to support me, but I can't say that this hasn't been a huge blow to my self-esteem.  It sounds like I really need to work on becoming a better person - I didn't even know that I had all these problems, and I can't tell whether they're over-blowing it, or if I need to change myself to go back to them.  I kind of don't want to go back to them, but I also don't want to have bad blood and just cut all of them off.

isfj,"I've been getting into the functional side of MBTI to get a better understanding, because I think people are really biased about themselves so I don't trust my own judgment. I checked out the mbtitypeme subreddit and they think I might actually be an ISFJ or ISFP. In the past, I have only typed INFJ and INFP. I took an MBTI test in school and got INFP, but sometimes I think its really easy to assign yourself the wrong type. 

I will say, I think ISFP is less likely because they sounds more ""graceful"" and aware of their surrounding than I am. They sound really great and interesting, but I think I wish I had their qualities more so than actually having them. I really like creative types and artists. 

I thought it might be easiest to come here to have a chat with you all about ISFJ-ness, because it never occurred to me that I might be this type. I've always felt out of place/sorts in American society, and that doesn't seem very ISFJ at all. If anything, I would think ISFJs would feel more at ease fitting in in social situations in society than I do. My impression of the states is that its a very SJ culture, and I've always felt and intense sense of not being a part of it. Not trying to make assumptions so much as give my general impression. 

I'm going to say that I am more than likely not an INFJ or and ISFP, because I see a lot of Si in myself. I would love to be either, but I don't think I am. 

Have any of you mistyped INFP before? What would you say differentiates you from an INFP? ",1553860140
isfj,"ISFJ Free Insights - From  [My Personality Test](https://my-personality-test.com/) 

&amp;#x200B;

 ***ISFJ Strengths***

**ISFJs** are naturally practical, dependable, and flexible. When interacting with others, they are warm, kind-hearted, and generous. They enjoy nothing more than spending time with friends and family. They are accepting of others, but often hold grudges against those who have wronged them in the past.

Although it may take a while to get to know an **ISFJ**, they make excellent confidants. They always are there for others, offering a shoulder to cry on after a bad day. They have the ability to develop strong bonds with others very quickly. They also have the ability to connect with animals and children easily.

**ISFJs** are very practical and observant. They are more concerned with the real-world impact of things, rather than big, complex theories and ideas. They prefer to rely on information they can observe, rather than intuitive feelings.

**ISFJs** are very responsible. They hold their values very strongly, and are willing to put in the time needed to make the world a better place. Oftentimes, their values are based on traditions, rather than lofty ideals.

**ISFJs** live in a world of possibilities. They love trying new things, and have developed very refined tastes. They appreciate things that are aesthetically pleasing, and take pride in decorating and organizing their home.

&amp;#x200B;

 ***ISFJ Weaknesses***

**ISFJs** often seek out the opinions of others, but may have a hard time accepting criticism. They may become reliant on others‚Äô approval to validate their self-worth. Others may view **ISFJs** as overly-sensitive and emotional.

**ISFJs** enjoy helping others, but for some ISFJs, this may translate into trying to change others. ISFJs must always remind themselves they can‚Äôt help everyone ‚Äî they can only help people who want their help. This tendency may become particularly troublesome for **ISFJs**‚Äô romantic relationships. They may initially enter into a romantic relationship wanting to help someone change, but may become frustrated when their romantic partner can‚Äôt change.

**ISFJs** strongly held values, coupled with their responsible nature, gives them the drive to work hard and meet their obligations. However, **ISFJs** must always be aware of what the driving force is behind these obligations. Oftentimes, **ISFJs** can feel obligation from social expectations, rather than an internal desire to change the world. They must not fall into a routine of helping others at a cost to themselves and their own wellbeing.

**ISFJs**‚Äô strong desire to ‚Äú*belong*‚Äù means they may be overly concerned about their social status. They may become preoccupied with how others‚Äô see them, and this can potentially be damaging to their self-esteem and character. It is critical that **ISFJs** take time to think about their own needs and desires, rather than the needs and desires others have for them.

&amp;#x200B;

 ***ISFJ Parenthood***

**ISFJs** recognize the responsibility that comes with being a parent, and rise to the challenge. Their responsible nature makes them excellent parents who are willing to do whatever it takes to take care of their child. They respond quickly to their children‚Äôs needs, and love the feeling they get every time they help their children. **ISFJs** are always their children‚Äôs biggest cheerleader and advocate. Their children always know they can go to their **ISFJ** parent for help and advice.

**ISFJs** are great at setting boundaries for their children and enforcing the rules. Sometimes, however, **ISFJs** can become authoritarian parents. They can be somewhat controlling, but only because they want what is best for their children. **ISFJs** must remind themselves that making mistakes is just part of growing up, helping their children learn and grow.

&amp;#x200B;

 ***ISFJ Romantic Relationships***

**ISFJs**‚Äô dependable nature makes them excellent romantic partners. They may take a while to open up, but once they do, they are eternally loyal, trustworthy, and loving. They are not just looking for a casual fling ‚Äî they want to find a long-term, committed relationship.

**ISFJs** are willing to give a great deal of time and energy to their romantic relationships, but their relationship will not thrive unless they receive the same amount in return. This is especially true of receiving affirmation from their partners. In fact, **ISFJs** often seek affirmation from their romantic partners, as well as their friends and family. They often become preoccupied with what their partner thinks. They will fish for compliments, and can be very sensitive to conflict within the relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

 ***ISFJ Friendships***

**ISFJs** make very loyal and kind friends, and are always there for a friend in need. **ISFJs** are always accepting of and willing to help others, even those who have very different personality types than themselves.

Once **ISFJs** make a friend, they work hard to maintain their friendship. They are always looking for opportunities to spend time with their friends.

&amp;#x200B;

 ***ISFJ Work Habits***

**ISFJs** are very giving and are willing to help others when needed, and this is apparent in the workplace. **ISFJs** are great team-players. They enjoy working in groups, and are both flexible and practical when doing so.

People with this personality type have trouble dealing with conflict, and will to go great lengths to avoid conflict. Although they may seek affirmation from others, they are very sensitive to any negative feedback. Oftentimes, **ISFJs** take negative feedback very personally, and will harbor a grudge about it later on.

&amp;#x200B;

 ***ISFJ Career Paths***

**ISFJs** are very in-tune with others‚Äô emotions. This, coupled with their dependability and organization, makes them well-suited for careers in leadership or administrative roles. They tend to seek out and enjoy careers where they can directly help others and see the impact they‚Äôre making every day. They often are well-suited for careers in child care, management, counseling, administration, health care, public relations, and teaching. **ISFJs**‚Äô eye for aesthetic beauty, coupled with their organizational skills, also makes them well-suited for careers as photographers or designers.

I'm thinking that maybe themes could refresh every month or so, depending on how many we have.

isfj,"Im an ISFJ with social anxiety. Yesterday, I [28/F] felt a whirlwind of emotions after I found out I wasnt invited to a friends baby shower. I'm not super close to this friend, but I've always been invited to her first kids birthdays and her wedding previously. I occasionally comment on her posts and IG stories but I wasnt invited to this event. Apparently everyone else in our group was invited. Maybe she knew I couldn't make it. I work weekends and it's very hard for me to take those days off. 

After I found that out, my night was horrible. I continued to over think, like what is wrong with me? Maybe I'm not lovable? 

I have another example. In a different group of friends, my boyfriend and I were not invited to he wedding. We hang out in the same group, she even invited me to her bachelorette and bridal shower but I couldn't go because I just opened up a business and I told her that... Because of that, we weren't invited to her wedding. Everyone else in our group was invited. 

I honestly dont know if it's me? I'm pretty friendly, but timid at times. I just feel like this happens to me alot and it makes me feel as if I'm not good enough or maybe not social enough. I'm confused because I have 1 good female friend who invites me to everything and introduced me to all of her groups of friends. Shes very extroverted and has many friends....so I cant be that bad right?

I have many friends but that's the thing. I have many friends, but not many whom I have deep connections with.

It'd be like playing basketball and everyone constantly saying shit like ""You know I could be better than you if I tried right?""

Hell I'm just a tertiary user and I find it insulting. It also leads to just unending arrogance over on the ENTP forum. Go to google type in ""arrogance entp"" and you can find unending swaths of threads with the ENTPs laughing over their arrogance and saying shit like ""it's just a feeling that if I tried I could be better than everyone.""

Background info: 

She's uncomfortable with talking about it, though she has told me bits and pieces here and there. I've told her that she can always talk to me about anything and that I truly care about her. 

I'm worried that she's internalizing her emotions and feels like a burden to her friends by talking about it. Which as an INFJ, I do ALL the time and I totally get that.
I need to be told explicitly that someone really cares about me for me to open up.

Our conversations are typically around day to day life and I never really ask her about the problems. By doing this I'm scared that I'm being to cold or distant.

isfj,"Hi there, friendly neighborhood INFJ here with a question. In Jung‚Äôs eyes, according to Psychological Types, the biggest issue for any type is the inverse of the dominant, and not something like the inferior function; surely a weakened function but certainly not the enemy as it works together with the dominant(again, in Jung‚Äôs eyes.) So in my case when a strong Ne user pops off with some possibility jumbo jumbo and comments like ‚Äúanything is possible‚Äù I literally just.... oooo I bite my tongue, but often times I just disregard almost entirely what they‚Äôre saying. It‚Äôs not until say an ENTP drops down to Ti and Fe that they would ever really have my attention. I‚Äôm wondering if something similar happens with an ISFJ? Would any of you consider the advents of Se to be.... preposterous? Like, the complete rejection of your past, your tastes and images from before, senses so strong that one might as well still be there, due to Se being focused only on the here and now. Would you have any examples, I would really appreciate it? 

I have an INTP cousin that explains what it‚Äôs like as some level, to taste a burger and have it not be ‚Äòthat one‚Äô burger, among other things. But he would not even consider Se due to it being in the blind spot, but an ISFJ would so I‚Äôm actively curious on how that works. Maybe how you‚Äôve noticed it differentiate between say even an INFJ since an INFJ would use Se at some level, or perhaps you‚Äôve come across an ESP, or anything really?

isfj,"I started a relationship with an ISFJ a while ago and it started great and it still going well. There are a few things I had questions about. One is why they don‚Äôt like to text back. And often will miss a text I send. Another is our conversations sometimes feel forced because I have to do all of the asking. I feel like I have to come up with topics to talk about. Which I do all the time in my friendships but I want my romantic relationships to be more fluid. Is this something that comes with time? Is there an explanation on why he doesn‚Äôt choose to share what is in his brain. He also never just comes out and tells me what is going on his life or anything about his personal life unless I ask. He will tell me but doesn‚Äôt openly share it with me like I enjoy telling other people about every aspect of my life and thoughts on things. 

With all this, please note our relationship is good otherwise, he makes time for me unlike any other relationship I‚Äôve had and is really physically passionate which I love.

I am almost positive, personally, that there is something to this, even though I do not strictly try and type people based on their physical movements and eye movements, and speech patterns.  But I've seen many people in the MBTI community say that they think this doesn't work.  So I'm curious: what do you think of visual typing?  When you're trying to type someone else, what do you use to do it?  I usually pick up some sort of vibe (""oh, pretty sure that they're an introvert, or at least value alone time,"") go based on the vibe, observe physical movements, speech patterns, and any instance of them using a particular function, to get down to business.

* First time speaking to her, I asked for her notes since I missed class then asked for her number in case I miss any more notes in the future. She said she was just about to ask for mine too 
* Once asked if she started studying yet. She replied and asked, ""did you want to study together?""
* Asked me for homework help pretty often then started asking questions to get to know me via text after I asked if she's going to an event happening over the weekend. Proceeded to ask for my social media
* Had a study session with her. She suggested a cafe but we ended up in the library. She had food that she kept offering to me and said she could've bought me something too even though I declined when she asked before we met up
* Began including me in her list of people she sends nonpersonal snapchats to after I replied to one of her stories so now we have a streak started by me but she always saves it when it goes on hourglass timer
* She said we should celebrate after our midterm with boba but was busy so she said next week. Next week came along and she brought it up again, so I scheduled a day to go. She then also asked if I want to get lunch too so we did 
* The day of our hangout she comes into class with makeup on and a nice outfit for the first time all semester. She goes out to eat almost on a daily basis
* During our lunch, our conversations mostly consisted of asking each other questions to get to know each other better
* She joked around with me by calling me a freak at one point 
* After our lunch, she said she wishes she could drive me to her city to get good food and that we should meet up if I end up attending the concert she's going to
* I replied to one of her stories with a question, which she answered. An hour later she double messaged me asking to make sure I like sweets and told me she'll give me some of the sweets she bakes some time 
* She once also told me she'll cook for me to try some time
* Recently talked about desserts with her and I mentioned never trying one of her favorites before. She said we'll go some time so I scheduled a day. She said yes but realized I meant afternoon, not morning so she said she'll let me know because she might have a meeting but still hasn't gotten back to me yet
* We don't really talk through texts nor does she reply to my nonpersonal snaps much but I don't often reply to hers either

I'm not very altruistic either. I will help others with tasks, but only if they ask or after I ask. I've never just started helping someone unprompted. If I ask if someone needs help and they say no, I might ask again if I'm still worried about them, but will leave them be if told no again. I am usually good about asking if people need help. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've heard that ISFJs are the most extroverted of the introverts, but I am the most introverted person that I know. I don't start conversations or take the initiative in meeting new people. I appear standoffish and distant. I also don't try to contact friends or most family. I do make a point of visiting my parents on occasion. I also tend to be quite quiet in any group larger than two people. I can be talkative on occasion. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not a gift giver, which is another ISFJ stereotype that I've heard. I don't care for receiving gifts, so I generally don't give them either. On the rare occasion that I do decide to give a gift to someone, I end up anxiously trying to decide what to give them. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've also heard that lower functions tend to be unconscious, and I can sometime find that I am using FE without realizing it. When talking to people, I can have different mannerisms and vocal tone depending on who I'm talking to. This happens automatically for me. I notice that when I am talking to someone who speaks in broken English, I will start speaking in a similar way. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am also a shut in. I don't spend much time outside in nature. I prefer to spend my time inside, unless my friends are doing something outside. I've been called a homebody. 

&amp;#x200B;

These are most of the reasons why I question whether I am an ISFJ of not. I do fit some stereotypes, like being polite and nice. I have always been well behaved, stubborn and averse to risk. I am a picky eater and can tell if what I am eating tastes different than usual. I also use to be very sensitive and would state if my feeling had been hurt. I'm also very indecisive. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for hearing me out. I'm sure that this wasn't helpful in figuring out my type, since stereotypes aren't indicative of type, but I was wondering what everyone thought. Are these things that ISFJs express, and is the uncertainty of type common in ISFJs?",1552258895

isfj,"Hi r/ISFJ,

I'd really love to see what you guys think about this as it applies to ISFJs. 

_____

While I'm also generally curious my main motivation is that I managed to screw things up with an ISFJ girl I really liked last year and I told myself if I cared about her I'd leave her be (which I did). 

Now she's back on the periphery (at work) and is being friendly, which is tough as I've been trying not to show it but I still have a lot of feelings for her. 

Every part of me (ENTP) wants to be up front and tell her how I feel so I'm not hiding my motivations but out of care for her I don't want to make her feel uncomfortable, so I have to ask, *is honesty always the best policy?* 

Things went to hell before when I realized how much I liked her and got anxious/afraid of being honest for fear of scaring her away and I know how personally she takes dishonesty (as do I). I never expected to see her again and I've worked so hard on improving myself since partly out of guilt for that whole situation, so I want to handle things better this time. ",1552239106

They are the traditional silent stalker, the ones who become serial murderers at age 40 out of a growing sense of meaningless in life. Everyone moves away from them, and rightfully so.

The word ‚Äúlove‚Äù to an ISFJ is loaded. If they say they love you, you should change your name. They are talking about an undying burning flame of worship and eagerness to please, and though they will never¬†voicewhat it is they want, you will know. Usually they will romanticise a scenario and keep trying to achieve it. We do not recommend becoming involved romantically with an ISFJ, because you will never know what goes through their mind, and you will never be able to react exactly as the ISFJ wants. If they need to¬†articulate¬†what they want the whole thing is¬†ruined, you see.

You might have an ISFJ friend, and you might have them for like, 8 years without even touching them, and then one night you overhear them describing you as their [gender]friend on the phone.

isfj,"Just started a relationship with an ISFJ, kinda. He works with me and I like him a good amount. He was always the person who is quiet and to themselves but after one night out as an office we got touchy and one thing led to another and we slept together. I was clear that this is not a hookup and that I prefer long term things. The ISFJ seems to like me back and anything I ask we do together they do very willingly. 

So my question is, they seem to very distant. Thinking about something a lot. I carry most of the conversations, which I‚Äôm fine with and am used to but I‚Äôd like them to start some convos. I know eventually I‚Äôll get tired of that. They always talk enthusiastically once I bring up something.

&amp;#x200B;

It's too much. He's too nice. I really really appreciate it sometimes, but when it happens so often the thing he does for me feels less like warm fuzzies and more like he's my slave. I am a very independent person, and it's really hard to let him do things for me so frequently. It's not just something nice here or there, but every. little. thing. 

&amp;#x200B;

We've had a conversation about this, so I know he knows how I feel, but I think I maybe didn't explain things in a way that will fix anything because it's continued. I really like this guy and I don't want to mess it up, but I'm feeling suffocated by his love right now. Any advice on how to discuss this with him?

Also, reading on the sub-reddit, I see it's very common for ISFJs to act like this and, while they want to do things to make you happy, they also secretly resent you for it. I have this latent fear that he's not actually genuine with his actions and that he's ""trying too hard"" or putting me on a pedestal that will some day be torn down and he will disregard me for the flawed human I am. At the same time, I feel crazy for saying that since everything feels so incredibly genuine with him. Any thoughts on this from the ISFJ perspective?

isfj,"Hi,

I am currently in living arrangements with some of my acquaintances (2 couples - 4 people) and one of them is an ISFJ. We have been living together in rented accommodation for 3 years now. Me and her have always had civil relation with each other.

That gradually changed over time: due to our immense differences in tastes and interests, we started talking less to each other, and eventually it came to a situation where her behaviour towards me is the following:

1. She would never initiate any conversation with me. If I say hi, she would say hi back, and that's it. She wouldn't even look at me when saying it. She never asks about how am I doing and if I didn't initiate the conversation, we could literally go months without talking to each other.
2. If I tried initiating - asked her about how her day was, etc. - she would answer using very short sentences without giving any 'hooks' to continue the conversation going.
3. All of the above is not the case with anyone else: if someone else asks about her day, she elaborates, uses facial expressions such as smile and actually looks towards that other person. She also follows up with a question of her own. None of that happens when she talks with me.

&amp;#x200B;

Can you, dear ISFJs, enlighten why is this the case? Is this how you behave towards a person that you dislike? Maybe she hates me? Doesn't feel comfortable around me? Is it possible that the main reason she acts towards me like this is because we are just so different?

I certainly feel like I have an INTP side - it's hard to explain, but even though Si and Fe are the functions that I use the most daily and value the most, my Ti and Ne always seem to be working in the background.   When I'm thinking about something, I'll sometimes almost feel like my Ti+Ne are more prominent than my Si+Fe, even though it wouldn't seem that way on the outside.

I would try to compromise by talking about things she was interested in, hoping the conversation would be deep, but she was still content to just discuss surface level stuff.

It‚Äôs worth noting that she grew up never being encouraged to pursue and interact with the world around her. Her family was fairly materialistic and not very thought provoking.

isfj,"I am new to this subreddit and I hope that it is okay to ask for advice. I am an INFP and concerned about my ISFJ.

I (24 f) am in a serious relationship with an ISFJ (28 m) for almost two years now. We live together,  we are very happy with each other and can usually openly talk about any of our concerns. But a few days ago I noticed him (lets call him Sam) checking my phone and lying about it when I directly asked him if he did. I am not angry but I am worried why he felt the need to lie to me. I am hoping for some insight or advice from fellow ISFJs.

This is going to be a long post. But I don't know the reason for his behaviour and I don't want to skip possible important aspects.

So before this all happened I was visiting my friends and family for a few days while Sam was working. I was spending one evening with two female friends. Usually when I am with friends I don't spend much time on my phone because I rarely see them alone and want to get the most out of the time. Me not texting Sam back while being with these particular friends has been an issue before. So I tried to at least answer once every hour. Sam can be very jealous when he feels like spending time with anyone else is more important to me than he is. My girl-friends are both single and like to go out and enjoy the attention of men. But they did never push me to do anything I don't want to do nor did they ever abandon me because of a man.

There might be another incident Sam is associating with these friends. Around the time when I knew him for about two months, one of my friends was having a party. We played a drinking game and I drank way to much alcohol. I got wasted and ended up in bed with a man I didn't know before. This is absolutely no typical behaviour for me and it still freaks me out how I changed under the influence of alcohol. Me and Sam were not in a relationship back then but we where seeing each other regularly. I did not text him the whole evening,  which made him suspicious. Beeing the ISFJ he is, he kept thinking about this incident and asked me about this months later. I was honest, told him the whole story and apologized. Although we weren't in a relationship and he knows that this was unusual behaviour for me, I know that it still hurt him.

In the beginning of our relationship I was also occasionally chatting with a guy I knew from school. Nothing special, mostly just small talk and it was only important to me because he was the only male friend I had left. Sam wasn't comfortable with this. He was jealous and thought that guy was interested in more than just friendship. Because I love Sam and I don't want him to worry or feel insecure, I stopped texting and it turned out that Sam was right. He was sexually interested in me and didn't care much about our friendship, so I am not too sad about ending this relation.

I guess because of what happened and the way my friends are, Sam is always worried when I spent so much time without him. Sam has also been cheated on before. This makes him extra vulnerable. I know that and I would never cheat or do anything to hurt him.
I want to point out that on the evening last week with my friends, there was absolutely no alcohol involved and I tried to text Sam as often as possible. Me and my friends were staying at home, talking and catching up on each other's lives.

When I returned home, everything was fine. Sam was very happy seeing me again and we enjoyed the weekend together.

On the day he was checking my phone I had a severe anxiety attack. I was crying for hours and he was comforting me the whole time. He did calm me down and we were talking about everything on my mind. I was completely honest with him and I don't think that I held anything back. I trust him and he knows that I do.

Later that day I fell asleep (probably because of the excessive crying) while watching a video on my phone. I woke up when Sam was entering the room. I was still very exhausted and wanted to continue sleeping. I didn't move and pretended to still be asleep. I waited for him to either leave the room or join me and cuddle up to me. Well he didn't. He was grabbing my phone and didn't move for a while. He was standing there doing whatever he was doing while I was still pretending to sleep. After about five minutes I realized that I won't fall asleep again and felt stupid. I opened my eyes and he was still standing there looking at my phone. He pretended that he just came in and stopped the video. I know that the video wasn't playing anymore and that he had my phone for at least 5 minutes. 

Later that day I wanted him to tell me what was wrong. I asked him if he was sure he didn't look for anything on my phone and was just turning the video off. I asked him if something bothered him or if he was worried about me writing someone else. He then lied to me. He told me the video was still playing and I woke up right after he stopped it. He also tried to convince me that he had no reason not to trust me and that he feels too loved to ever expect I could do something behind his back. The next day everything was fine again and he seems to be happy since then.

I know that there was nothing interesting on my phone and that i dont keep any secrets from him. I am not even mad that he somehow invaded my privacy. But I am really hurt and confused why he lied to me. I can't stop thinking about this. I don't know if he was concerned about me spending the time with my friends, if he was worried because of my panic attack or if he might even be self projecting. I do trust him but I know that people develop trust issues when they are the ones cheating or feeling guilty. So now I am getting paranoid and this messes me up. I don't want to accuse him of anything and I feel uncomfortable asking him about this again because he might be upset about me pretending to sleep. I would have never expected what happened. As I said we do usually talk about everything and I absolutely don't know why he lied.

I have to confront him again and tell him that I know he lied. Otherwise I know that I will trust him less and that this will haunt me. I don't want this stupid incident to affect our relationship.  I get mad at myself for even thinking he might be cheating and therefore not trusting me anymore.

I'm wondering if it's common for isfj's to feel misunderstood. I often see things online about how intuitive types are widely misunderstood and misinterpreted, due to them being more rare, but I noticed that for a majority of my life, I too have felt that way as well. When I'm speaking or trying to explain something, sometimes the people around me think I'm reacting/feeling one way when in reality it is the opposite. I also feel as if the people I'm closest to are rather shortsighted and lack vision (and proper planning skills). As far as I can tell, no one in my closest family are xSxJ's (xSxP is very common).

In case it helps, I live with an INFJ (my mom, the person I'm closest to; she often knows how I'm feeling/how I think, but occasionally, there is some misunderstanding), and an ESFP (my grandmother. Very unhealthy version of type; there is often friction between us).

It‚Äôs such a beautiful feeling, having that much love and affection and care for someone; feels like it‚Äôs my life‚Äôs purpose. But I also hate it bc I know how hard I fall when shit goes wrong. 

My current partner of about 5 months (ISFP) really struggles to concretely express affection through words. His body language would indicate to me that he feels just as strongly as I do, but also he claims he has never been in love with anyone before. 

I have no problem interpreting my emotions and once I understand them, I feel like I need to express them. I told him I loved him last week, to which he didn‚Äôt say much (which I expected). I‚Äôm not concerned that he didn‚Äôt say it back‚ÄîI know words are hard for him.

The problem is I cannot turn a blind eye and follow through things despite not wanting to do them or seeing no value for me in doing them. I continually downplay almost all ideas unless they are genuinely near-genius and my skeptical nature makes me see all, even genuine intentions, as something with darkness lurking beneath.

But I really want to learn how to stay focused, dependable, helpful, honorable and loving for a longer period of time, for that it's the only path to hope.

isfj,"I have this ISFJ friend, initially we clicked really well and I started to let her know more about myself when most people wouldn't have the chance to. However recently she seems to be taking advantage of her knowledge about me and seems to be using it to make me feel emotionally negative.

For example: I mentioned that I do not like it when people ignore me when I am talking, and these days she purposely switches to another topic or totally doesn't reply me. I know that it was done on purpose since she was looking at me but doesn't give any acknowledgement. She then goes on to intrude on my privacy by leaning in really close to look at my messages, even when I tilted my phone the other way.

I used to be hurt at this behaviour, but I'm finally letting go. However, she is someone that I'll be seeing for some more years and I have no choice but to stay diplomatic. The thing is that when I start talking to her, I get sucked into our 'duality' and forget to close up, letting the cycle repeat itself.

It's a painful process, so I'm seeking advice here. What do you think about my situation? How can I take measures to prevent this from happening? ",1550820259
isfj,"hey everyone this is a throwaway acc

I've known this ISFJ for about 7+ years and around a couple months ago there was a large misunderstanding where rumours were being spread that I was talking about people behind their back within our friendship group. No one really believed these rumours except him(I'd assume because he is VERY close to the person spreading them). I tried to directly message him(as we don't see each other often) with an apology(because he did seem very passive aggressive whenever I was in a  group call with him) and an explanation of the situation while asking what he thought of the situation, but all he had to respond with was a very short message of him wishing me the best, but him saying we should end it there.  
I think that this was in an attempt to kick me out of the group(cause I do tend to isolate myself from situations)  
However, this didn't end up happening and a couple weeks later we ended up having a gathering with our group.  
The interaction between us wasn't passive aggressive though, but rather something I found odd.  
I found himself distancing himself from the entire group every now and then and it all seemed very unnatural?  
I was wondering if he feels even remotely bad for cutting me off. He still interacts frequently with the person who initially spread the rumours and I don't even know if I want to message him again about the situation. Every time someone tries to ask him about the situation involving me and him he tends to just completely dismiss it(sometimes even meme it) and change the subject. It seems as if he has no reason to hate me/think i'm a bad person? Is it to do with staying loyal to the person spreading the rumours?  I'm very confused on what I should do. Is there anyway I can rekindle this friendship?

isfj,Existence of this type is clearly a mistake. While ISFJ females are desired by literally half of population that males are literally not needed by anyone. Si doesn't bring anything to society at all. It just assuring something that is already settled in social norms. Fe for male is literally suicide. Male shouldn't ever suppose to have Fe at all. Indicating feeling is high school always ended up with being shut down by normal well adjusted thinking users. You might think that feeling exist for purpose of connection and understanding. Its completely stupid. Relationships are always trade of knowledge or submission stronger personality to other. You won't ever be friends with some just for sake of enjoying spending time.

isfj,"Hello! I am an INTJ [21M] and I have this friend ISFJ [20F] who a while back told me she had a bad weekend and is dealing with this 'self crisis'. I do have a lot of interest in her, and I'm intrigued by the way she thinks and by all means I wanted to help and understand her. But when I asked about it, she deflected and avoided the topic alltogether. I know it's hard for her to just open up like that so I didn't push further when I saw she didn't want to give any details. At that point, we were not too close either, more like friendly acquaintances if even that, so I had no reason to continue on the matter.

Couple weeks passed, we ended up talking a lot more. I could tell she enjoyed my company and on numerous occasions she was the one who initianed the conversation (which is totally out of her character, but she is definitely making an effort for our little friendship to work). On the other hand, I also enjoy it as I find people with a different view than me especially intriguing. 

Then yesterday, after a short chit-chat she tells me she had another bad day. Now at this point I am confused, worried and the curiosity is burning me inside. From my point of view, you don't go around telling someone you had a bad day without being at least a little bit enclined to share it. Therefore I assumed she wants attention. Furthermore, as I said, I do want her to share what's in her mind with me so I can get more insight in who she is and possibly help her or at the very least give her some feedback, yet again, to my surprise, when I asked her about it, she changed the subject instantly. I told her that she can be open with me, yet to be fair, I might not have been very clear.

Now, my question for you ISFJs out there is if I should keep pushing considering I really want to know what's going on and understand her, or just let it go and give her some space. Rationally, she being an ISFJ, the reasonable choice would be to let her deal with her stuff despite that being against my interests if I don't want to end up dismissed by her. Though I can not ignore the fact that she was the one that bringed up the bad day in the first place.

So how can I go about her opening up? Is she not comfortable enough yet?

isfj,"Yes folks, it's time for another one of these! My rambling below is not important though, feel free to ignore it and start your own discussion lol.

So, we've been hit with a TON of snow up where I am, far more than usual. And my landlord has been incompetent at getting the snow removal guy out, which means I've gotten stuck in the driveway more than once. I had to call CAA this morning because I got stuck with my back wheels off the ground and I was two hours late to work. Also, yesterday I got stuck in my friend's driveway and burned up my tires.

So this morning the landlord told me the plow guy can't come until tomorrow at the earliest. Well, the windrows left by the city plows are easily 2 feet high in the worst parts, and I didn't own a shovel, plus there were none on the property (I searched). I borrowed a shovel from a neighbour this morning and cleared a little path. This afternoon I came home from work and the city plows had pushed the snow up like I wasn't even there this morning, so I kept on driving and went to Canadian Tire. Bought one of those ice breaker sticks and a small shovel as well as some salt and some engine oil (unrelated, wanted to top it up). Returned home, parked on the street, went to pick up my friend, went to Lowe's and bought a more intense shovel. Came home and shoveled for an hour. We made a car sized path to get into the driveway, and I got in with only some back and forthing required.

We were going to go to a pub but called it quits because shoveling tired us out. Oh well. Now the other neighbour with a car just came home and got stuck, in the driveway though so at least he's there and not stuck on the street so he won't get a ticket, but I'm not able to get out again until either the plow guy comes, this guy leaves, or I shovel my way out. He's using the shovels/ice thing I left outside now to try to get unstuck. I asked him if he wanted help but he said no, he's fine.

The driveway fits ten cars (five by two) so it was no easy feat to clear out space. I left a big mountain in the middle of the driveway because it was too difficult to throw the snow up onto the person-high piles that already exist by the curb.

I thought we‚Äôre going to be okay and we‚Äôre going to be a team, but he broke up with me last week. He‚Äôs reasons was his emotional stress and the demands of his job and our long distance; that he feels lonely and for him it didn‚Äôt work out because we didn‚Äôt have the chance to be together most of the time. I understand his reasons but I have a gut feeling that there‚Äôs someone else, so I asked him straight up if he‚Äôs seeing or talking to someone else. I asked him to be honest with me because regardless if there‚Äôs someone else or not, I will try my best to understand. He knows that trust and honesty is very important to me. But he lied. He denied talking to someone else, stating that he only wants our relationship to end because of our situation. I stalked his social media and that‚Äôs when I saw the photos of the girl he‚Äôs been commenting and reacting to for about a month now; the girl is reciprocating the comments and it looks like they‚Äôve been talking for awhile now. I sent him the screenshots and asked him how can he lie to me. He can‚Äôt fully explain himself, and I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because he doesn‚Äôt care anymore or maybe he‚Äôs shocked that I discovered his lies.  Despite what happened, I remained calm and just asked him to explain it telling him that I deserve an explanation. I really can‚Äôt believe that he can lie and hurt me. I‚Äôm the first girl he dumped (his first love cheated on him and he‚Äôs been single for the past 12yrs; been dumped by girls he tried pursuing before), and he confessed this is the first time he did this to someone. And that hurts so much. How can he can do this to the only person whom really cared and loved him genuinely. I‚Äôve been patient and I always supported him, but I guess it was never enough for him to stay. 

This hurts me so much because this is the first time I‚Äôve experienced this kind of betrayal. I feel betrayed and he broke my trust but I don‚Äôt want to move forward without forgiving him. You know what? I may be stupid, but I still feel compassion and love towards him that I still wish the best for him. I know this happened because he isn‚Äôt the right man for me, but still, it is causing my heart so much hurt and pain that‚Äôs more than I can bear. For the past week, I‚Äôve been crying every night thinking about what he did to me and the things I did to make him feel that he isn‚Äôt alone‚Äî that despite what I did, he still left me and replaced me; and he did find someone else while he was still with me and talking to me. I know we haven‚Äôt had the chance to be with each other in person regularly in as muh as we wanted to, but I don‚Äôt think that looking for someone else without ending your current relationship is a terrible thing to do, especially to someone who just wants to make you feel loved and cared for, someone who really thinks you deserve happiness.

I don‚Äôt know if he still thinks of me or if he still cares about me. But I‚Äôm sure he doesn‚Äôt love me enough to respect me and consider how I‚Äôd feel. It‚Äôs so sad thinking that someone whom you trusted so much, whom you thought could never betray you will do so.

Our last conversation was over a phone call, because I asked him for a closure that I deserve. We did talk but I never felt that he‚Äôs affected by the pain and hurt he caused me. I almost cried while talking to him but I‚Äôm glad I was able to tell him all I wanted to, and I hope he realized how much hurt he caused me. In the end, I told him I forgive him and I still wish him the best because I really do. He thanked me for everything and apologized. I cut off contact with him and I asked for us to not update each other anymore so I can move on completely and that‚Äôs the last time we talked.

I couldn‚Äôt bear that we don‚Äôt finished the report, so I felt obliged to do so even if it weren‚Äôt my parts.

Still, I can‚Äôt be mad at them because I know that group works always end up like this.

So, how do others ISFJs handle group work ?

isfj,"Okay. I was going to try to write this post without being longwinded but I can already tell it's going to be a page stretcher, so there'll probably be a TL;DR at the bottom if you want it, but I'm going to explain a lot of context things for my specific situation in between. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, I'm an ISFJ through and through. I'm also a type 6w7, if it matters at all, and on top of it I have moderate anxiety which is where I get my habit of 'anxiety talking'. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've found that in the workplace and in social situations where I'm not surrounded by people I'm very familiar with, or care to get close to, I don't speak unless I'm explicitly spoken to OR if I need to ask a question, otherwise I'm content to just sit and watch conversations play out around me. But when I'm with friends, this is 100% the opposite. I've found that I have a bad habit of going on forever about something, even (a lot of times) rambling/circling the same thing over and over again/taking forever to get to the point. This might be anxiety, but I'm starting to wonder if it's something in my personality? When I notice myself dominating the conversation like this I don't FEEL anxious, I actually feel excited in the moment, until the realization hits that I've talked for way too long and everyone else has things they want to say, then I feel guilty, and then when I try to stay quiet and let them talk, I find another point I want to chime in on (this is usually during group discussions about what we think, so it's entirely valid to chime in on things, it's just the fact that I take up so much time talking it turns into a Ted Talk by Me on accident.)

&amp;#x200B;

I know I can be a good listener if I try, it's clear I can do it when I'm at work, so why can't I do it when I'm with people I'm comfortable with?? I know I'm able to speak more BECAUSE I'm more comfortable with them, but I don't know how to condense what I have to say down into a way that EVERYONE will understand AND have it be short. Also, when it comes to listening, it's not like I don't listen well at all, because when my friends DO talk, I DO listen, so it's not like I'm a bad listener so much as I'm a bad.. talker? Except instead of too little, I talk too much. 

&amp;#x200B;

I only know 2 other ISFJS in real life, one is younger than me and one is a lot older than me and all 3 of us have anxiety, but I notice that the younger one is a lot quieter than me/is very patient with what they have to say, but the older one can go on tangents too, almost similar to me.

&amp;#x200B;

isfj,"Just wondering how other ISFJs feel about pets! So I know we tend to have a rep as caretakers, I think, and that sounds accurate to me because I tend to ""mom"" my friends sometimes... lol.

But what about animals? Like, for example, I don't have a partner and I'm too young to have kids, so when I moved out I kind of gravitated towards having pets. I have a cat (almost had a second, but she didn't get along with my first cat so i just fostered her for a while), as well as five aquariums. I also had a hamster, but I didn't like him very much so I gave him away to some friends (who then got a female hamster who bred with him and now they have a lot of babies xD). I got another hamster, but she was sick so she died. I was thinking of getting another, but I don't really have room in my small apartment for a cage at this time.

I also tend to be kind of strict about taking care of pets properly, which is why I rehomed my hamster (I didn't like him so I knew I couldn't give him a good home), and also why I don't believe dogs should be kept in apartments, or that Bettas and goldfish should be kept in small tanks. I have a huge personal responsibility thing going on. Lol. Which also means I spend way too much money on the pets I *do* have. üò≥

What about you guys? And what are your favourite pets? Personally I'm not really a dog person because they are waaaay too high key for me, and have too much energy (medication makes me always tired), but cats and fish are perfect. I imagine a more active ISFJ would like to have a dog because you can do a lot with them.",1548428185
isfj,"&amp;#x200B;

I'm sure many of you guys have heard of the ISFJ Si-Ti loop. So in every personality type the dominant and tertiary function are in the dominant attitude for the type. So for an extrovert the dominant and tertiary function are in an extroverted attitude and same for introverts with their dominant and tertiary function. Every personality can have a tendency to get into a dominant and tertiary function loop. Because we feel the most comfortable in our introverted world we can enter a dominant-tertiary loop with our Si and Ti. I wanted to write out this post to help people identify whether they are in an Si-Ti loop and provide some tips for how to get out of it. You guys can also comment with ways to get out of the loop. 

**Si-Ti loop in ISFJs**

We can get caught up in remembering past experiences and then instead of checking in with others via our Fe to get outiside perspective we can use Ti to overanalyze the past experience and get stuck in a rut. Our we can use it to become perfectionists and insist that every detail is done perfectly. In addition, we can use it as a strategy to emotional disconnect from others to avoid getting hurt. We could also use it as an excuse as to why we can't make friends or leave the house. This obviously in the long run leads to a critical spirit towards other people and feelings of loneliness and unhappiness. While it is good to get better at Ti, we shouldn't be using it more than Fe. Ti must be used in service of Fe. 

&amp;#x200B;

**How to get out of a Si-Ti loop** 

The first step is to try to get out of your head. The main thing that helps me is to remember the human element in decision making. It also helps to if you have someone you trust to talk about your feelings and emotions as this can allow your Fe to breath and relax a bit. Reach out to someone you haven't talked to in a while and see how they are doing. Think about ways you can help the people in your lives. Volunteering is also a good option.

isfj,"hey fellow isfjs! Sorry this is quite long


Last year i was hired by a popular bank corporate group . I was assigned to the assistant accounting position but weeks later i was redesignated to a teller position. I asked why . The hr told me that since i am not an accounting graduate , it would be best suited for them to assign me to a teller position since i was an economics graduate. I was hesitant to accept the offer because i wasnt sure how my career path would turn out but a job is a job so i accepted the offer. I was like thank god now I won't endure the stress of job search. I was trained but i felt like the training was not enough to prepare us for the real life transactions. On the bright , i met new friends.

Trainings were graded unfortunately and i failed 3 out of 4 training quizzes. Luckily i passed the final exam training but i knew it wasnt enough to increase my overall grade which meant that i wasnt meant to be in a teller position but it was too late to back out.After the training , the trainors told us that we would be assigned to our branch near our homes. It was time to part ways . However, we still try to get in touch with one another.

When i arrived at my branch, i was greeted first by two guards in front of of the entrance door. I smiled at them but just as i was about to enter the building, one of the guards told me that nice people arent allowed in this place. At first i thought he was joking but my gut feeling told me that he wasnt kidding at all .

My superior, the service officer, arrived 5 minutes after i enter the building. She then told the guard to guide me to her office. I was rather greeted by a grumpy and annoyed woman as if she was telling me that i wasnt welcome to her office but i just brushed it off as her having a bad day. Soon, my coworkers arrived along with the branch head. The branch head asked us to come together for the introduction. The branch was nice towards me as she made me feel welcomed to their place. As for my co-workers , they didnt say much and the service officer was indifferent about the introduction. After that, the service officer told me to just observe the environment and how mu co-tellers operate. The first teller i met was open and nice. I would ask questions from other tellers like how to file for shortage or overage, how to process utilities payment and i would just watch them how they do those processes. Sometimes, one of the tellers would ask me if i know how to process related transactions and i would agree but there were times i would say yes to the questions even though i had no knowledge of them but still i wouldnt hesitate to ask them. Sometimes i wouldnt bother them because of so many transactions they would process.

This week, the service officer told me to come upstairs for some ""talk"". But Before that , i reviewed my training materials for preparation. Unfortunately i could be forgetful sometimes.

It was past 5:30 pm when she ""interviewed "" me. She asked me about the basic cash deposit and withdrawals as well as how to receive cheques and whats the difference between on us check and local cheque. I answered some of them correctly but for some questions, if one answer that i think is wrong i would change the answer. She then told me that she "" doesnt need my confidence. Dont test me"" . I was taken aback at her rude response towards me but i didnt care. I just wanted to go home during that time and take some rest. It wasnt even my intention to come off as ""arrogant"" and she judged me. 

the following morning( this week), i was called by my service officer and to my surprise, she told me that she hates arrogant people who are know-it-alls (referring to me). I was taken aback because i didnt act like an arrogant know it all during observation. I was quite but i would ask question if neccessary. Then she told me that there is nothing wrong with asking questions. One of the co tellers told her ( the service officer) that i was arrogant because i wouldnt ask questions and listen to her which was NOT true at all. Maybe because it was my quietness that led them to believe that i wasnt asking questions or i wasnt even listening but the truth is i was listening. 

i defended myself by explaining that i did ask questions and i did listen to their instructions but it seemed like she didnt listen. She then told me that maybe i was acting out or maybe i was projecting. She was so judgemental and i couldnt believe she said that. That time my gut instinct was telling me that i should quit this job because i wasnt happy anymore.
That same day, it was my first time to transact cash deposits. Unfortunately , i incurred a shortage of $1 at the end of the day. The service officer got really mad at me for being careless. I explained to her that the tasks got overlap and i apologized . She then yelled and told me that she would grade me low if it happened again.

so the following day i filed a complaint against my superior for bullying me ( accusing me of being arrogant and know it all and for going home late because of that ""interview"") to human resources and signed my resignation paper.

I was both happy and sad at the same time. Happy because I got out of toxicity and sad because flow of income will cease once i leave the job. As of now im searching for a job that will suit my course.

do u think i did the right thing?

I have a lot of friends, and it's true, some people don't like me, but not that many. But a trend with ISFJs seems to have surfaced. They think I lack people skills. One of my friends that I've known since I was eight (I'm 30 now) has commented periodically through the years that I lack people skills, though has never been willing to elaborate when I've asked him what he meant by that. I thought this feeling toward me was individual to him, but other ISFJs I've met and made this comment as well, which has shown a trend now.  


I can tell you right now, other people don't tell me this, even the types that tend to be more blunt. In fact, I usually get very different comments, usually positive. Are ISFJs not good with perceived conflict? My friend of 22 years acts like any difference of opinion is automatically ""conflict"" and always attempts to smooth things over in group settings as if he's some kind of referee. I've never been able to have conversations with him about deeper matters, religion, politics, etc, he 's always clammed up pretty fast. These other ISFJs I've spoken with were willing to talk about these things, but were really offended really fast, and now seem to hate me with a loathing passion, of which I sense vindictiveness in the way they communicate now.

* Make/Add/Edit/Delete Post and User Flairs. Will be useful when any new game in the series comes out. You don't have to have experience making flairs before since there are guides but previous experience can certainly help.
* Add, Edit and Enforce the Rules. Our ruleset is very outdated and could use a makeover. Depending on how you view the state of the subreddit the mod team can think of ways to improve the sub for what they think will be for the better. And of course make sure to view the mod queue, any user reports or any topics/comments you think are not following the rules.
* Think of ways to update the appearance of the subreddit. Whether it's banner ideas, the overall presentation of the topics on either old or new reddit, subreddit icon, etc. CSS and/or Photoshop experience can help with this.
* Ideas for sticky topics. At the moment I've just been stickying anything that looks like it can be helpful or hard to find.
* Keeping information, wikis and sidebar up to date. As I said above, I have a table that lists upcoming events that I never update. The wikis are empty and could use nice information. Other important info could be put in the sidebar.
* Any other ideas to make the subreddit better for all users.

When I originally took the MBTI, I tested as P rather than J as I love new experiences (if I have time to research and prepare), new ideas (provided a good argument) and am very open minded (which I attribute to a strong Fe). 

I am in a family of J types, and they seem to fit to ""J"" box a lot more strongly than I do. Does anyone else, as an ISFJ, feel like they are fairly open minded relative to other J types?

I feel ISFJs get stereotyped into liking their set routines and never deviating from them, but I don't feel that's exactly true for ISFJs.",1544644137

isfj,"First thank you so much for the resources posted in the pinned post. I feel more confident that I am  a natural at showing my ISFJ love. :D 

Here is my situation.

I am an INTP lesbian in a long distance relationship with an ISFJ highschool teacher. I love her so much. She is the smartest, most beautiful person I have ever met in my entire life. Did I me mention she is the smartest, most beautiful person I have ever met in my entire life? Well, she is. She is the smartest, most beautiful person I have ever met in my entire life. üòç

Neither of us is willing/able to move to be closer for reasons. The long distance is going to be how it is likely until we both retire. Say 13 years at least for me. I highly doubt she will ever give up teaching. Seems very unlikely, why would she?

She is VERY introverted, and behaves like described in the pinned resources. She caves in her home on the weekends. However, 2 people in her life pry her out of there, so she never gets enough cave time. She gives past where it hurts.

And I get them, spending time with her is as close as you to can get to heaven while on earth.

Anyway, we talk on the phone on our way to work on weekday mornings. Other than in person visits that's about all the contact I get. Once in a while she will answer the phone after work, but not usually. I can sometimes get her to respond to a text. Maybe one in 20 or 30. So once or twice a week unless she is sick, then oddly I get texts.

Here is where my heart burn is:

I don't get enough response from her for my needs. This is actually physically painful for me. Unfortunately I am an INTP with an 8w1 sx enneagram. It's very painful to not hear from her at all, all weekend. Not even a good night text. To make it worse, she knows and appologizes and tells me she isn't ignoring me, and she isn't. I'm sure she reads every text I send. She just rarely responds. 

My assumption is that replying to my texts is not rewarding for her. Telling her I need more attention I think did more harm than good. It's true, but it added pressure.

The problem is clearly mine. How can I phrase a text that she will respond too?

Some examples of texts I can get a response from:

What are those fish oil pills you have called? I want to get some.

Why are 0 and 1 values in computer programing different than math?

Do you remember the brand of socks we bought? Gosh, they are so soft, I want to buy more.

Maybe the real issue is my 100% N and her S. Sigh üòî

Maybe I can't get any more attention than I already do.

I think i'm a true ISFJ, except for the fact that I want to be a business owner. I'm currently a manager of a restaurant that I would like to someday own. In the past, I've been an Administrative Assistant, and I did not like doing things for other people or being told what to do.  However, I also feel uncomfortable delegating tasks or telling others what to do.  

You may wonder, how do I do my job right as a Manager if i'm an ISFJ? 

I've been a manager for over a year now and I'm actually very proud of myself for being able to delegate tasks to my employees. It does make me uncomfortable because I have that mindset of ""If I want it done right, I better do it myself"". However, I know that these people are getting paid to work and this is their job to clean, work, etc...  I have to put on that ""Manager cap"" and that ""I shouldn't care what others think of me"" mentality.  

Sometimes I feel that I am too considerate of my employees because my closers have alot to clean already and I feel that if I ask them to clean a few more things, that I may be overworking them.  So I dont even bother to add certain things to their closing list and just have the morning/midshift employees do it instead.  

Also, i'm not sure if this is an ISFJ trait or not, but I feel so bad whenever I get a feeling that someone doesn't like me! Of course I understand the fact that not everyone will like me, but I can't help but feel that way!",1543915520

TL;DR at the bottom should anyone wants to skip the short description.

We have known each other for about 3 months now, we text everyday. I‚Äôve previously confessed to her already, but she has mentioned she doesn‚Äôt feel comfortable yet and wishes to know each other as friends first, before moving on. Also, she has mentioned she doesnt feel comfortable going out with me 1-on-1 especially since she is really lazy to go out. She is only comfortable with meeting with me 1 on 1 for meals or studying (and it‚Äôs winter break now so, I can‚Äôt exactly ask her out to study). Just recently, she has refused to allow me to follow her private Instagram account (even went as far as to change the username after telling me the initial username), and refused to disclose the location of her new part-time job (I had suggested going there to see her). As far as I have read, this should mean she‚Äôs still fairly uncomfortable telling me stuff? 

TL;DR
ENFP male chasing ISFJ female. She texts me everyday and refused to allow me to follow her private instagram account. She also found a new part-time job and didnt want to tell me where it is. Is she still uncomfortable? 

PS: And also, while we were *both* messing around on her Tinder profile, on her phone, I noticed notifications (text) from 2 other different guys. 

Question: does her texting me everyday mean anything at all, considering she could be texting 2 other dudes on a daily basis anyway. Is her refusing to share details a sign she‚Äôs uncomfortable? And how do I proceed from here?

I‚Äôm an INTJ girl new to the forum and I was wondering if you all could offer some insight on a situation that has been troubling me for a while now.  

In my freshman year of high school, I met an ISFJ male at school.  Every day, he would walk across the whole cafeteria to eat with me in the opposite corner, come sit by me in the library, and always waited with me by the lamppost after school.  Through his persistence, we became close friends.  He trusted me to the point of telling me very private secrets about his past.  I eventually got him a job working as a gardener and farmhand for my parents.  One day, he told me that he liked me.  I replied that his feelings must not interfere with his work, and I declined to give him a definitive answer back.  To complicate the situation, my parents decided to give him a truck so that he could commute to work without constantly having to rely on people to give him a ride.  On his eighteenth birthday, I gifted him a laminated four-leaf clover I discovered in the woods behind my house.  A few weeks passed, and I addressed the topic of his feelings for the first time.  After a bit of flustered banter back and forth, I admitted that I liked him back.  He was planning to return to his home state of Kentucky upon graduation in May, but he said he would stay in ILif I wanted him to.  We never formally spoke about this occurrence again, though I occasionally saw him when he worked at the farm over the summer to build a livestock pen.  Most of our interactions were through text or chat sites, as I was rather busy that year.  My mother was extremely overprotective, and would not let me freely interact with friends, especially not guy friends, without supervision.  He once tried to ask my mother if I could go hiking with him or if he could drive me home on early dismissal days, but my parents always refused.  Meanwhile, the livestock pen was taking quite a while to build, so my mother would often ask him how much longer it would take.  She began to put pressure on me to hurry him, and finally I wore out and went off on him during a text conversation.  In the heat of the moment, I told him I was upset that he did not come to work regularly and that I got the impression that he never considered me a friend (my mother‚Äôs idea). He was quite affected by it, and I felt rather remorseful afterwards.  We made up the next day.  After that, he texted me every time he was working to let me know he was.  

To give you an idea of our drastic background differences, I am the daughter of Taiwanese immigrants and he was a Scotch-Irish country boy from the backwoods of Kentucky. In my parents‚Äô traditional culture, interracial relationships are forbidden, and I mentioned it once to him.  He became very angry and the conversation was never brought up again.  

Fall arrived, and I returned to school.  We had a series of spotty conversations, always abruptly stopped because he was busy doing something.  I could never figure out what he was occupied with, but I did not want to become a burden of annoyance so I never ventured to ask.  I messaged him one day with my regular greeting, and he sent back on the chat site: ‚ÄúHey, I don‚Äôt think we should talk on here anymore.  I work 9 to 5 every weekday and the stock pen has taken so long that I don‚Äôt want to risk upsetting your parents.‚Äù  Though I felt a cold weight drop in my stomach, I replied with a terse: ‚ÄúOkay, that sounds like a good idea.‚Äù  He responded with ‚ÄúYeah, sorry.‚Äù  That was September, and it was the last time we ever spoke.  

He was killed in a workplace accident a month and a half later.  The day after, I was called down to the school office.  It was his sister, and he told me that they found in his pocket the clover I gave him and she gave it back to me.  She told me that my friend had told their dad that he was staying in town to wait for me to graduate and turn eighteen (I was fifteen then), though he wouldn‚Äôt do anything without my parents‚Äô permission, namely my father‚Äôs.  I went down to his hometown for the funeral, and I was surprised that his relatives in Kentucky recognized me, saying that he often spoke about me.  However, I don‚Äôt know if his feelings changed since the time he‚Äôd told his family in the summer.  

I know that it is impossible to know what was going through his mind, but he was an ISFJ and I was hoping that you ISFJs could help me make light of this situation that has been troubling my mind.  

Some questions:

Why do you think he stopped talking?  Was it because of the weight of responsibility, or was it because he no longer cared?

Was he planning to date or was he wanting a marital relationship?

Would he have re-established communications?

He has moments where he'll come to talk to me about certain important things in his life - but only if I've already been talking to him.  He rarely initiates the conversation. As an ENFP it's quite frustrating because all I want is to talk about everything all the time, but I understand he's not always in the mood to talk or on his phone.

Should I give him space to allow him to talk to me first sometimes or just continue initiating because that's who I am (and he should maybe accept that)?

I had tried to break it off with him a couple of times by talking it out and letting him know exactly why I felt it needed to happen. Both times, we got involved again - he was very patient with me and I couldn't stay away. 

A week ago I ghosted him and I know he's crushed. I know I'm a terrible person. I felt like ""talking things out"" was just repetitive behavior at this point. I also feel stupid for my indecisiveness, so I guess it was easier for me to be a coward than to talk to him. 

He's very difficult for me to stay away from, but it is killing me to think about the fact that I left him and how I chose to do it this time. 

It has been a sort of tumultuous time in his life and I had given no indications that there was anything wrong and I don't know why. I had told him to confide with me on certain things and then I abandoned him. 

The last thing he said once he realized I was no longer responding to him was that he would always love me and that he would be here if I ever wanted him back. To me, I take that to mean that the door of communication can still be open.

Here are my questions for any ISFJ's that have taken the time to read: 
- Do I apologize? Or is it better to leave him alone? Doesn't he deserve closure and acknowledgment?

- Do I offer to continue platonic support for what he is going through? 

- I want him to know that I know that my behavior was unacceptable, and that I do care for him. How do I do this?

My whole life I've been through plenty of loss, enough to think I'd be used to it by now even though I'm still young, but I still spiral into emotional breakdowns and catastrophizing at the thought of the inevitable: my loved ones dying.

What gets me really quick is thinking about my pets dying, and how theyll surely die before I do, and it hurts so bad to even think about that I regret owning them and setting myself up to get attached and have to let it go, and ive almost nearly sworn off owning another cat after my childhood cat died. 

Other things are similar, like thinking about how my parents are going to die way before me, and I haven't even ruled in accidents yet. Thinking about my friends/partner dying makes me wish I never attached myself to people in the first place even though without them I wouldnt be who I am today and of course I love them. 


Does any other ISFJ out there feel this? I struggle with anxiety so it might be worsened by that but I'm wondering if it's a common problem and if so, what makes it such a common problem.

I'm an ENFP and I recently started talking to an ISFJ. She's amazing and really likes me, but is super hesitant to move forward and give more time to me because according to her, I don't know her too well. I'm so used to just divulging everything about myself to everyone I know, that I'm not used to learning other people / figuring other people out for myself. She'd really like it if I get to know her better, but I really don't know where to start.   


I feel like I'm caught in this catch-22 where I have to spend time with her to get to know her, but she'd rather give time to her friends because she trusts her friends more, so as a result I don't really know her too well, so I can't show that I'm trustworthy/reliable/naturally receptive to who she is, and the cycle continues.   


I'm also really poor at figuring people out / predicting their behavior, so I need like a people-101: How do you get to know someone from the ground up?

When I suggest he cancel and explain that he doesn't have time/isn't feeling well etc, he feels extremely guilty and feels like he's letting everyone down; even if the situation/event is really not that important.

isfj,"So, I think my brother is an ISFJ (Like, I'm not an 100% certain, but he fits the description). He's currently failing in his studies, which in of itself, isn't a problem, every does that, and I did too.

**The problem is more that his attitude is getting more and more dodgy :** 

He avoids everything, blames his problems on other factor, he doesn't own up to anything. He's officially a NEET now, and well, beside passing time on his computer, he doesn't do much. 

If you confront him, he will say that he's tired or something, and try to escape, or other similar excuses (2 years of this). I'm writing this now, he went to sleep but I can hear game sounds from his room. He also using his own bad sleeping habits as an excuse for more bad choices... 

Now, I get it, he dislikes that a lot. He said it himself. Ie, too much Ti, not enough Fe. From my POV, it's not like I pursue him or anything, I just don't buy his BS. I don't yell or anything, I'm basically just asking difficult questions (and not just the gotcha kind where the answer is in the premise)

**He imitates me :** 

I'm 4 year older, not so much now, but a lot in the past, he imitated me. 

A good exmaple would be formation. Back in highschool, i choose a brand new formation called STI2D, which is kinda meant to form enginneer. That's on paper, I got fooled, in the end, you become some sort of tehcnicians, and you do what other people tell you. It was filled with idiots (we actually spent two months on how levers work because people pretended they didn't get it, where they simply weren't trying to listen or understand... 2months on fucking levers... The teachers made it simple, and they still managed to fail somehow.) 

Long story short, I dropped out, and managed to get my BAC as a free candidate and get back on track at uni. Right now, I'm in a Master, but I still lost 2 years.

So when it was time for him to make the same choice, I told him, multiples, just stay on the simpler path, choose ES (economique et social), the one with the most people on it. It's rather easy, you will be fine. 

Where it's weird is that he choose this exact same STI2D formation. He even put it as his first choice, with ES in second. I told him not to do it, tons of time, he still did it. I don't get that at all, he literally had no reason to do that, and tbh, it was a very stupid mistake. Now, he admits it was a mistake. 

Insights into this would be appreciated, because I really don't get it... 

Maybe it was teacher pressure or something... 

**What I did so far :** 

Unlike my father/mother, and some ""friends"" I don't put pressure on him. I don't ask him thoses bs question about his plans or tell him he needs to get on it. That's counterproductive, you only get pre-made answers...

It's like a ""-How are you ? - Fine"" exchange...

I don't sympathize too much eitheir tho, because it's kinda dishonest, he didn't really earn that sympathy eitheir. I also tried in the past, it didn't work at all. There's also that I'm an INTP, I dislike to do that shit. 

Also, if the problem is that the group doesn't accept him, I, as an individual can't counterbalance that, no matter how much I try.  

Like I said, I was in a similar NEET situation a few years ago, so I really get where he is right now, but I dunno, I completely assumed my choice, and it was relatively easy to get back on track. Using that experience, and just looking at his actions, I can see he's full of shit when he says he will change...

So when I talk to it with him, I try to get at the root of it. What does he want deep down ? If he doesn't get that himself, he won't make good choices/keep being lost. I guess it's too much Ti, because it always end up with him running away (still, I'm the only one irl that he talks so long with, anyway)

** What other did ** 

Personally, I know pressure doesn't work, it's actually a huge part of the problem. The more pressure you put, the less he does. Putting too much pressure will just push him to choice that aren't his own, so when he fails, well, it's not fault, now is it ? 

My mom just insists that he works harder. My older brother, an ISTJ, is trying stuff out on his part, also arguably failing in his studies, but he is owning up to it. It's hard to contact him on my part, and I don't think he gets it eitheir... Not enough to give good advice or help him... 

My (ISTP) dad did even really stupid things to force his hand, like putting him in some residence for young people with problems, as it would ""teach him discipline"", or taking away the computer because  he's ""addicted to it"". Dumb, dumb, dumb...  All that set us back a lot... 

My dad also divorced my mom, and now is together with some SJ, with her life in good order and all that. (I actually think she's an ISFJ too) She has children of their own, and well, they are sucessful compared to us, so not only the comparaison pop up often, she also acts like she can give advice. Itt, more stupid, pointless pressure. 

*What he's doing :** 

Right now, he's trying formations that are engineer-ish, on the same path of that STI2D formation he kinda faile (He did it to the end, earned his BAC, but he skipped so much that he has big holes in it, also, a terrible attendance record.)

As far as we (the family) are concerned, he is simply unsuited for thoses engineering formations. He tried a BTS last year (post-secondary education in 2years), and gave up pretty quickly. So the rest of the year, he did nothing, when time came to make a new choice for new school year, he basically insisted on continuing on that path even if we told him to try other stuff. Be it law or economics, or even a language formation. Nope, he just put the same stuff, got accepted in only one (a DUT, this one in 3years) ... Now 3 weeks in, he decided he would stop... 

I don't know why he's insisting on it where he would have better options elsewhere... He just doesn't listen to me, even when he answers and even agrees with me. 

I don't know why. Maybe he didn't considerall his options well enough. Maybe it's a form of pride. Maybe he just continuing on this out of habit, in a way... 

He says it interests him, but well, it doesn't interest him enough to actually work on it or go to class, so we might as well say it doesn't. 

Now, he talks about changing, and doing something in informatics, but the same problems will occur, he will start, see he doesn't have the level of knowledge necessary, stop going because he feels bad about it, and thus his lack of knowledge will only increase, and he will have lost another year. That's it, if he's even accepted in it in the first place (Btw, we're in france. Higher education is more or less free, but they select the better student. With his current dossier, they will say he's not serious and et someone else)

That NEET thing is really a vicious circle, so he needs to get out ASAP. 

I won't say he's ""depressed"" or anything, I don't throw bs diagnostic like that around because I'm not a psychologist, but it certainly is getting to him too...

We are in october right now, so it's probably too late to salvage this year, but I want to do something now, because he's running out of option fast. If he fail to complete this yera of formation (even if he intends to change afterward), it will just leave another bad mark on his dossier/attendance record. 

You guys are ""responsible, loyal, realistic"", and really, he's good at that stuff concerning others (like, he was very helpful at my cousin's recent marriage), but he fails to do apply the same standard to himself...

***
Anyway, my point is this. 

**How do I push/help him out of this ?** I don't want a direct solution, a miracle cure or anything, just that he owns up to his choice, because he's really running out of time and options. I'm also tired to cover up/lie to our mother on his behalf. 
* Of the stack, what should I focus on ? Fe ? To me, the solution was more that he confronts his problems, so Ne and Ti... 
* What kind of job/career really fit you guys ? And why ? Just saying what you do/have tried works for me, I don't want to rely on the shitty ""best career for ISFJ"" pages on the internet.
* Is it actually depression ? Please don't use the term lightly too or play internet psychiatrists, but if you have insights because you were in a similar place, I will take it. ",1539549508

isfj,"I think males in our society our taught more to repress their emotions and be more logical thinkers.  As a result, I think ISFJ girls tend to have a much easier time developing Fe. I know as a male ISFJ I don‚Äôt get to exercise and use my auxiliary Fe as much as I want too. While I still use Fe to be polite and compassionate when possible, I know it‚Äôs been hard in my life to relate to other guys on an deeper level that I think we ISFJs need to feel like we have a connection with that person. I feel like I have to tailor my Fe strong emotions down when I hangout with thinkers so they don‚Äôt judge me as overly emotional or illogical. I know a lot of them consider me to be their friend because I listen to them and validate their opinion (even if I don‚Äôt agree with it). It‚Äôs always great having male friends that are feelers that I can be more of myself around feeling judged. Now that I‚Äôm developing Ti, I do sometimes wish I was a Ti Dom so I can be more detached and think logically without being conflicted with Fe. As an ISFJ, I think Fe just gets in the way of Ti natural nature of independence and impersonal logic. It‚Äôd be hella nice to be a Ti Dom. What do you male ISFJs think?",1538463646
isfj,"I got this idea from watching Sherlock when John Watson (classic ISFJ) was lamenting how unbelievable it was that he fell for Mary, who turned out to be not what he thought she was.

Now of course IRL it‚Äôs not as extreme as that but I personally found my self attracted to guys who are not exactly textbook ‚Äúgood guys‚Äù.

I get that sometimes a quick conversation just abruptly ends, but if I ask a question to arrange something that we talked about and you don't respond to that, what am I suppose to do? I might reach out again a couple days later to ask again as a reminder, but it gets frustrating. 

Sometimes I'll ignore that happened and text again a few days or a week later and they'll answer the new question and pretend nothing happened before that.

I'm going to chalk it up to me being more sensitive lately, but how do you guys deal with it, especially with your SO or close friends?

isfj,"Whenever I'm on the INTJ subreddit, I'm always stunned by how many people on there profess a great dislike for ISFJs and Guardian types in general. Usually it seems to come from immature guys who have an ISFJ mom or something and are bitching about how she's ""so limiting"" or ""too emotional"" or ""not on my level intellectually."" As for me, my parents are the ""intuitive dream couple"" (INTJ-ENFP) and while they're awesome people, they can be a bit...intense and overbearing at times. I really recognize what sensors do for the world--honestly, without them, nothing would function...Anyway, I meandered a bit, but basically what I want to say is that ISFJs are AWESOME.  


A few reasons why:

\-You have unbelievable emotional intelligence. As an INTJ, I have pretty much none. I'm barely in touch with my own feelings, let alone other people's.  
\-You're practical and know what needs to be done in a given situation (I'm always living in my head and missing details).   
\-You're consistent. As someone who values this greatly, but sometimes has trouble maintaining consistency himself, I really appreciate that.  
\-You're selfless. Objectively a great trait and one which I very much lack.  
\-You're really nice. Criticisms of ISFJ characters in books and movies usually revolve around something like ""She/he is too nice."" Well WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH BEING NICE?! Certainly nothing last time I checked. On the topic of books, two of my favorite literary heroines are ISFJs (Lucie from A Tale of Two Cities--who sometimes gets hate but I don't understand it--and Sonya from Crime and Punishment). Incidentally, they both try to help massively screwed up INTJ guys.  


Honestly, most of the time I hate people and I can be a cold bastard , but you all make me want to get in touch with my Fi and be a nicer person more than anybody else.

isfj,"I am so attracted to you and have the deepest of love and appreciation for you.  I have only dated INFJ's and ISFJ's (not by choice, it just works out that way...before I even knew what MBTI was).  I feel like in many ways the INFJ is more of a natural fit, but the ISFJ completes me more in a developmental way.  So here's a list of:

Top 10 things I love about the ISFJ.

1. **The ISFJ is SO ""cute""!!!** \- I feel like the ISFJ are the ""cutest"" type.  Where as I find the INFJ more hardcore and ""hot"" in their depth and complexity but, I've always been attracted to cuteness, lightness, innocence, positivity, and responsibility.  I've always thought Marge Simpson was an ideal partner (ISFJ).  You guys are societies' Disney Characters and I LOVE IT SO MUCH.
2. **The ISFJ/ENTP combo makes the best fictional relationships** \- Jim Halpert (ENTP) and Pam Beesley (ISFJ), Back to the Future's Dr. Emmett Brown (ENTP) and Clara (ISFJ), Saul Goodman or Jimmy McGill (ENTP) and Kim Wexler (ISFJ) from Better Call Saul, Sebastian (ENTP) and Mia (ISFJ) from La La Land....I could go on...basically all of the enviable and great relationships in fiction are ENTP/ISFJ :D
3. **The ISFJ ""Includer""** \- As someone who feels lonely and a chronic misfit most of his life, I cherish those who are sensitive to including me and making sure I feel okay.  My ISFJ wife is so thoughtful and concerned about people being left out, feeling unwelcome, or being lonely.  ISFJ's are the champions of inclusion.  Thank you.
4. **The ISFJ and fairness** \- As someone who is committed to justice and equality, the ISFJ develops ""fairness"" within my soul. This can be annoying at times, as what is fair is not always delivered on the same terms as justice and equality.  
5. **Responsibility and Dutiful** \- These are the two things I do not naturally possess for things related to the ""day to day"" and the short term duties such as paying bills, keeping commitments, following through.  The ISFJ helps me in this.  And in return, when it comes to core values, long term vision, and things that have lasting impact, I help the ISFJ first be able to see the big picture and remind them why it's important to stay true to your values (or develop them for yourself in the first place).  When it comes to long term commitment, I have no issues.
6. **The ISFJ is ""Good""** \- I love how you are so ""light"", I can see it in your eyes.  You are such an example of random acts of kindness and charity.  Again, thank you for this example.  I can be inclined to fudge things, bend rules, even tell white lies when I feel it serves a bigger purpose, and the ISFJ is there to remind me to be totally honest.
7. **ISFJ's are surprisingly deep** \- I know they can seem superficial, but that's only when they are limited in their exposure to others who are deep.  The ISFJ has the ability to ""know"" things about people, they are surprisingly good readers of character when emotions aren't being manipulated.  When there is a manipulator out there who could use the ISFJ's emotional susceptibility, the ENTP has your back.
8. **The ISFJ saves souls** \- I feel like the ISFJ's in my life have rescued me from some really dark places and really have a deep love of God or whatever you wanna call it and feels love very deeply in a divine kind of way.  The ISFJ's do this.
9. **My kind of sexy** \- Like I said, I always thought Marge Simpson was sexy.  Why?  Because of that goodness factor, that sweetness...and then out of the blue they blow you away with their surprisingly intense sexual passion.  I've always been attracted to modesty - the clean and self-respecting girl - I've never kissed a woman I didn't love, and held off on sex until marriage.  It was worth it.
10. **A good balance of being grounded and tolerant** \- You let me explore.  I need that.  And then, you bring me back down to earth.  I need that too.

isfj,"My beloved ISFJ's, I'm going to open up here, be brutally honest with myself and you - I woke up this morning feeling bad about something...like from the second I opened my eyes and oriented myself, but I couldn't figure out what it was.  Then I remembered.  My post.

Guys...I am so sorry.  I was going through something yesterday and I had no outlet during a very dark time.  As I said before, my wife has struggled with my new direction, and it's completely understandable, as leaving security and predictability for the unknown is not the ISFJ's preference.  

To give context for yesterday, I was in a state of loneliness and heartbreak as my wife was out on a country dancing date with a guy she met earlier this year and has had some intimate contact with (not sex, but kissing and that kind of stuff).  She met him while I was traveling for extended periods of time working on my book and academic research.  She has been suffering from male issues since her dad left when she was 9, was sexually abused at 11, and raised in poverty as both of her parents are deaf.  That said, I have a lot of compassion and understanding and my personality is suited perfectly to allow her the flexibility and space she needs to figure things out.  She met this guy who recently divorced his wife because she had anxiety and depression issues (so does my wife...just let that process for a minute).  But he's a blue-collar worker, simple, easy going, and he appeals to her feelings and gives her something that she feels is very good for her soul and I absolutely hate it, but I can tolerate it.  It's just a very hard thing for me.  She has always been vocal about how she wished I was more of a simple man, predictable, reliable, easy going, laid back...but then goes through periods where she's in love with my intensity and idealism.  The thing is...I WISH I was more of a simple man many days.  I loathe the fact that I was born this way, so overactive in my nervous system and brain, such a misfit, so lonely.  So the fact that she has sought out another man who is a simple man, makes me feel very sad.  The fact that he left his wife, that he has no problems pursuing a married woman...these are things that go against my deepest values and I do not respect as I am very loyal and long-suffering with my commitments.  I communicated to her that I was not comfortable with her going down to see him, that I'm not comfortable having an ""open marriage"" and the more I expressed it, things got ugly.

I think the thing that really has bothered me is how justified she's been by society to potentially jeopardize our marriage and little family (we have 2 little boys).  When I went from being clean shaven, neatly dressed, corporate and all that to having a beard, long hair, academic...it seems like she's been encouraged and justified to pursue this guy because I have betrayed our family by what is perceived to be irresponsibility.  

So here I am.  She finally came home after being out all night, and seems really happy.  We are going to marriage counseling (and have been for a while now).  I don't understand the ISFJ and how unselfish they can be in the short term but how fickle they can be in the long term.  It's like....we are exact opposites or something :D lol

If someone could speak to me and help me understand why a woman would ever want a simple man as a long term solution over a passionate loyal and faithful man who is a good father.  I feel like she's taking advantage of my openness and flexibility and that a lot of xSFJ's do too.  

Again, I'm sorry, and I thank you for letting me open up.  Now on to part two.",1536603758

isfj,"Why do ISFJ's feel so justified in holding such contradictory views such as being compassionate, loving, and understanding AS LONG AS those receiving the benefits of your personality are ""deserving"" of it?

Do you not see the ways you are manipulative?  Masquerading compassion and understanding so that you can ultimately get something in return (usually relating to feeling needed, receiving validation, praise, attraction, etc)?

Why do ISFJ's allow themselves to be taken advantage of and then cry ""victim"" so easily?

Why do ISFJ's adopt delusional narratives about others and themselves so long as they get the approval, attention, and validation they desperately need but typically on a superficial level?

Why are you even attracted to ENTP's?  You like the misunderstood one, the quirky one, the one who needs to be included in the short term but in the long term the ISFJ can be surprisingly shallow.

Why are you so shallow, yet, so capable of depth?  How can you live with yourself?

Why do you take advantage of our openness and flexibility but then decry those traits to ""them"" when engaged in gossip?

Do you not see the value in how the ENTP's capacity to predict and anticipate events before they happen and how the ENTP in a big picture way kind of has the potential to save you from yourselves, save you from a shallow, robotic, meaningless life?

Do you not value the countless hours we sit by and listen to you tell us about all the little events of your day, the trivial conflicts you were presented with, and then have very little patience when we want to share with you something relating to a theory or a concept or a principle we learned during our day?

Why are you so intolerant of theories, principles, and abstract intellectual conversations if they don't lead to something immediately tangible and concrete?

Why are you so predictable?  Are you really oblivious to your predictability or is it a matter of willful ignorance?

Why are you so obsessed with the way a message is presented and makes you ""feel"" when the content is valid?  

Why are you so quick to shut down anything that resembles an ""argument"" when in reality we are just verbalizing ideas?

============

I've been married to my ISFJ for 13 years...we got married as 18 year olds and it's been quite a journey.  Things in our marriage were great when I was an MBA/Corporate Salesman and all that comes with it (Traditional gender roles, stable and consistent paycheck, beautiful home on the lake, social status).  When I left that world in search of intellectual and artistic meaning and pursued my Ph.D. in Neuroscience, she really struggled with that, but was ultimately supportive.  She struggles with the questions she gets from her patients (she's a dental hygienist - a PERFECTjob for the ISFJ) relating to ""so, what does your husband DO"" - she liked it when she could give a one sentence answer that was easily understood and placed in a box for others to relate to.  The conflicts of ambiguity have been very hard for her.  She has also had to be more of the provider for our family as I invest more time and resources into all that goes with student life.

The conflicts in our marriage have arisen when she started listening to ""them"" - the social norm police.  It seems that for SJ types, the transgressing gender roles and social norms are grounds for justified criticism, judgment, and even hatred.  She used to be the defender of my quirks, but now she's slowly joined with ""them"".  So I need to vent.

I decided to take the test again just because I haven't taken it in a while, and I was surprised when I got ISF**J**, not ISF**P**. So i decide to look through the description to see if there's any reason why it's different, besides the fact that my Judging and Perceiving has always been very balanced. There was one thing that resonated with me so much I knew I had to be an ISFJ.

""*Given how generous Defenders are with their warm praise and support, it‚Äôs not surprising that others enjoy their company enough to call them friends. The challenge is to be considered a friend back ‚Äì people with the Defender personality type are shy and a little protective of themselves, but they also need to be able to connect on a deeper emotional level. It makes sense then that most of Defenders‚Äô friends are made not by random encounters on a wild night out, but through comfortable and consistent contact, as in class or in the workplace where they have the time to get to know each other little by little.*""

The person who I'd consider my closest friend, we only met a year ago, and it was by talking to each other consistently in class everyday our friendship grew. I think after reading this I was mistyped for a while.

- Introverted: 97%

- Feeling: 86%

isfj,"Hey everyone. Many of you related to my previous post, so I'm wondering if other ISFJs may relate to this as well. Over the past few years, I've found myself torn between two incredible potential romantic partners. I am single so I am seeing both of these men as we aren't exclusive right now, but I'm finding it very difficult to figure out which partner (if either) is ultimately right for me.   


The first is a man I relate to incredibly well intellectually. He is my best friend and we communicate very well. He's trustworthy, loving, and treats me better than I could've ever hoped! However, I find myself not being very attracted to him physically and sexually, and experience less admiration towards him. The second man I am extremely attracted to physically and sexually, and I respect and admire him greatly. He's also an extrovert so he gets me out of my comfort zone. However, we connect less intellectually (most of our conversations are playful banter, unless I bring up something serious) and I frequently find myself feeling inferior to him and trying to impress him.

All you ever think about is what will bring you pleasure. That is why you asked me out tonight. Only because I make you satisfied."" She would never say that because I am glorifying her satisfying qualities and holding her affections worthy of praise.  

This approach may appear very hedonistic but Duty, although necessary for a relationship isn't sufficient.

isfj,"Alone. Unloved. Miserable.

‚Äã

After I lost my (ISFJ) mother and the one other (ISFJ female) person that would listen to my analytical ramblings of passion, life was hell.

‚Äã

My father shamed me and told me that I was autistic. My sister that I loved most, found me annoying, lame, and repulsive.

‚Äã

I gave up my one activity that joined by problem-solving nature with an expression of emotion: Music. ... My emotions were no longer ex-pressed, so they began to be re-pressed. My health took a noise-dive.

‚Äã

When I stumbled upon Quiet, by Susan Cain, I felt so loved and understood that I wanted to jump for joy - which was unusual for my thoughtful and internalized personality.

‚Äã

Years later, when I discovered MBTI, I found that I was an INTx and I just kept shouting ""Yes! Yes!"" as I read about others with my same difficulties, loves, weaknesses, and strengths.

‚Äã

Finally, I realized that I am not an INTJ:

1. decisive
2. dresses formally
3. tends to dislike physical touch
4. does not require emotional or social validation from others.

‚Äã

Instead, I test clearly as an INTP:

1. indecisive
2. dresses casually and creatively
3. tends to crave physical touch, caressing, and hugging
4. desperately seeks emotional or social validation, which is inconvenient because INTPs crave mainly non-social environments.

‚Äã

Also, INTPs and find it extremely draining to maintain most social relationships. Showing up in a way that is agreeable to others, especially extroverts, is like balancing a stack of books on my head: it is an enjoyable challenge for about 30 seconds, and then from that point on, it is painfully inconvenient.

‚Äã

Ever since my family saw the Matrix (1999), I felt a special connection with Neo. I idealized Neo. I pretended I was Neo. I put Neo in my artwork. I only stopped referencing Neo once I reached the age when I felt to intimidated to be freely creative in my own geeky way. ... It was just this week that I realized that Neo was symbolic of an INTP living his/her full destiny and ""learning to fly"".

‚Äã

Now. A recognition of my ""better half"": the ISFJ or Defender personality. ... I can already tell a difference in my ability to love and accept myself, even before I have found an actual friend or lover who is an ISFJ (female).

‚Äã

So even the idea of there being a group of people out there who would be happy to know me. And who I could make happy without me wearing a social mask, without me pretending to be someone that I'm not: is incredibly refreshing.

‚Äã

I read a post from an ISFJ female who mentioned that she thought that we INTPs aren't attracted to ISFJs. And I just want to clear the record to say that just that thought of you ISFJs, let alone your actual presence, is to us INTPs completely:

1. endearing
2. inspiring
3. adorable
4. attractive
5. life-saving.

‚Äã

I believe that the ISFJ female I'm mentioning had just gone through a painful breakup with an INTP. ... And for what it is worth, just like I gave up my love of music for years because I thought that it ""wasn't practical and wasn't actually helping anyone in need"", we INTPs sometimes can forget how much our love for art and love for each other is ever so practical for health, happiness, and is so worth upholding.

‚Äã

Some people refer to ISFJs as \*fake\*. And to INTPs like me, ISFJs help us remember that love is \*real\*, and life is \*really\* worth living.

My mother is an ISFJ who's retired in the last couple of years. Almost every day she says she's bored and doesn't know what to do. She's dabbled in many hobbies over the years (including different forms of painting) but nothing has stuck. She loses interest quickly and her reasons for quitting are often people-based e.g. she couldn't get along with the others in the group. She's good at many things but she underrates herself and doesn't stick with anything long enough to improve or to fulfill her life

isfj,"As an ISFJ who values trust, loyalty, integrity more than anything else in a relationship, I find it more and more challenging for me to reenter the dating scene.

I had known a friend for years that I reconnected with, which then turned into something more. I felt safe and left myself wide open. Long story short, she broke my trust. Ever since that, I've learned to become extremely cautious about who I open to and what I share with them. 

I honestly would like to open up again to people in my life, especially the ones that I highly value, but at a certain threshold, I start withdrawing myself because I've gotten too close for comfort. 

It also doesn't help the fact that I very much prefer to get to know someone as friends over a period of time and transitioning to something more if there is something there. This allowed me to build a level of trust with them, and judge their character to see if their values matched mine. It's also a double-edged sword because the closer they become, the more afraid you are of the possibility of disrupting that connection. 

This became more relevant to me lately as I happened to skim over some interesting threads on /r/relationships and the things people do to their supposedly significant other. I suppose I'm not doing myself any favors reading about all the promiscuous things that can happen even to the most ""healthy"" relationships.

Thanks for taking the time to read and I appreciate any insight and suggestions! 

Long story short, I roomed with an ISFJ in an apartment a year ago. We met in college and became close friends and roomed together our sophomore year as well. We grew apart when I started dating and getting really close to this guy. I spent (and still spend) a lot of time with him. She didn‚Äôt like him and I think she thought I valued him more than I valued our friendship. In hindsight, I shouldn‚Äôt have put him above my other friendships...I was so excited to really click and genuinely be in love with someone that I accidentally started to blow off some of my friends and family. 

She never told me why she didn‚Äôt like him. Instead, she was extremely passive aggressive and rude to him whenever he came over. She acted more like my mom than my friend and that really pissed me off. I know she probably saw it as ‚Äúhelping‚Äù and trying to look out for me, but I saw it as controlling and rude. I used to really value her opinion and talk to her for advice, but when I got into a habit of thinking a bit more for myself and not telling her everything, she started to get distant and pissy. It‚Äôs like she enjoyed me being dependent on her and consulting her for everything. I tried to talk things out with her on several different occasions but she blew me off each time, so eventually I gave up and started being rude back to her. 

Fast forward a year and a half-we both apologize to each other and have hung out a couple times, one on one for much over the span of the past few months. It‚Äôs gone well, but we‚Äôre not near as close as we used to be. She seems to have grown a lot as a person and I feel like I did too. She reached out to me first so I think she‚Äôs wanting to rebuild our friendship too. We used to share the same friend group but she was friends with them first so I‚Äôve stepped back and haven‚Äôt made an attempt to hang out with them because I was introduced through her. 

I know this is probably a weird question but how do I pursue this friendship without seeming needy or awkward? How do I make the most of this? She reached out to me first, and then I reached out so would it be her turn to reach out to me again to hang out? ",1534098160

I'm an INTJ, she's an ISFJ (I remember because we did one of those company exercises where we took the test).  Over the years, we've developed kind of a ""frenemy"" relationship.  Friends but playfully antagonistic with each other.  We talk mad shit and hate on each other all the time, but it's all in good fun.  Years without any hurt feelings that I can tell.  At company outings we usually end up hanging out, etc.  There has never been anything romantic or sexual between us.

Out of the blue this week she has all but completely stopped talking to me or acknowledging me.  If I say 'hi' or 'what's up?' in passing I get a flat 'hi' and she keeps walking.

Maybe it's cuz I finally felt like I could contribute and have a discussion with her, rather than simply ask her questions about herself and be attentive to her needs. ",1532890834

isfj,"Me and my sort of girlfriend are dating several times. Yes we are long distance but I would like to focus on the time we ware together. 

I will give a brief overview of things that I found noteworthy.   
\- The first walks with here dog ware together, but after some days she didn't like my company and wanted to walk alone. Fine, no problem there.  
\- I brought some small food gifts. She looked at it, tried it short and never touched it again. (In my company.) Something to do with different love languages... In addition, I hid a book in here house to find it later, she was overwhelmed and it was the best gift ever.   
\- I personally don't like last minute changes. Although I know she has time in the proposed weekend, she hasn't agreed on it yet and it worried about it not being definitive. 

\- Most important point: Although I am the one typing the most in chats, she was the one talking throughout our dates. I was completely shut down, couldn't think of questions. Although we liked our company, we ware super silent after a while. I keep thinking about this, is this normal? Or has that something to do with insecurities and not profiles?

Apart from my experiences I wrote, I haven't seen many matching personalities. Can it actually work in theory?

Do you think it is even possible to give our selves a feature or am I trying way to hard to let this happen? Every thought is welcome!",1532519508

isfj,"We've been together for 3 years, still going well. The issue that I have is communication - I need to do a huge efforts in order to get him to communicate, that's how I feel like at least and it's making me exhausted because I am introverted as well (I'm an INFJ) I feel like there's times, especially when i start rambling about concepts and different perspectives about things like, love, life, the future, he zones out, or stops talking or completely ignores what I said. Of course I don't mind that necessarily, because I heard pretty often that ISFJs do that, and I learned to accept it and not push it, especially when I can tell they don't feel comfortable. My problem is that sometimes when I feel talkative I cannot shut my mouth, and without wanting it I start rambling again. I always just have feelings about things and I'm pretty open about it, if I get a certain 'vibe' from a certain something I tend to talk about that a lot, I can always tell that he just wants me to shut it, and I do, but then I feel frustrated. 

The only problems that we've ever had in our relationship, is a period of time where we were just toxic to one another &amp; the communication problem. We've been very stable for about 5 to 6 months now, with little to no conflict. What happened before was that we manipulated each other a lot, I was being very pushy to bring our relationship to the next level and I was trying to change his mind by manipulating him, while he wanted to move slowly, and he was constantly throwing blame on me and guilt trip me, he held resentments for some time as well. A year ago our relationship kept being one sided, for me for a period of time, then for him, and so on until we fixed our issues, and now we're stable.

Excepting the 'flashbacks' that we sometimes get about that toxic period of time, the only problem that we have is communication, and It's really hard because we're also into a long distance relationship. A thing I learned about those toxic times is that he has a hard time expressing his feelings, it feels like he just gathers everything and then explodes, and me, on the other hand, as I got very comfortable with him I share almost everything in a instant, which overwhelms him.


The only issue we have now is the communication (and we had it before too but It was overshadowed by the other huge problems we used to have) Our relationship has been a blessing ever since we fixed our issues and we set our boundaries and we're very much in love with each other. I cannot appreciate him more for wanting to work on this rather than break it off. The few questions I have are:

1. How can I make him feel more comfortable when I want to talk? What do you guys like to talk about and what kind of mood do you need to have to feel more safe?


2. Sometimes I feel like other people take advantage of his kind soul and I'm too scared to tell him, I used to tell him that in the past when I felt it but he'd just retreat into himself and refuse to talk about the subject. I don't want to push him and make him uncomfortable. I  feel like he sees me as controlling at times, but I really am not I'm just trying to warn him. He once scolded me for focusing too much  on the 'bad side' of people and ignore the good one. He is very altruistic and likes to think that all humans are good by nature, and he gets hurt because of that. He will really say 'there's nothing to worry about x' until the very moment he's being proved wrong. How can I tell him or warn him about certain things without making him uncomfortable?

3. What should I do when I feel frustrated or burnt out? I don't know if I should give him time or insist or just focus on another thing, I just don't want to make him uncomfortable. 

4. How can I help him relax when he's stressed out? 


I'm literally crying as I'm writing this because I love him so much and the last few months have been so amazing and I've never felt so safe &amp; secure &amp; emotionally/mentally stable with a person in my whole life. He brings me down to earth when i tend to be with my head in the clouds and that's one of the best things about him.  I have the need and the will to protect him too and to make him feel safe and comfortable but I just really don't know how to initiate this. I've been thinking for weeks and I feel like the wrong step could make him view me as a burden and I really don't want to ruin this stability.

He's not my main focus in life, but he's certainly a big one because I'm very family oriented and I'm never dating anyone just for the fun of it. It's always been serious. I am really passionate when it comes to him because I'm legit fascinated by his way of being,so kind and so positive.",1532197877

she very much tries to serve the group without showing off (Fe 2nd),  
she likes to tell things from her past (hours or years old), and is aware and cares for minute details (Si dom),  
she's not very incline to try new adventures, but sound like she'd like to have tried them afterwards (inf Ne)

But :  
She displays an easy going ""we'll decide that later"" attitude, which I'm wondering if she's picking up on from my Ne..  
She's prone to looking up for information about a subject on her phone (Wikipedia friendly)  
She's reserved and we haven't been moving fast at all (I've decided to let her have her rythm, which is obviously slow) but she was the one to send me the first message (online dating) and to propose we met (after maybe 20 messages)

isfj,"I think it would be some upsides and some downsides to dating a person with my same personality. 

Upsides:
We would probably both take the relationship seriously
We would both probably be caring and loyal mates. 
We would also enjoy a nice and quiet lifestyle.
Also, we would probably be accepting of each other‚Äôs flaws 
We would also put a lot of time and effort into the relationship.
Downsides:
The relationship might get boring overtime since we both would be risk or change averse. 
It might be hard to even initiate this relationship at first since ISFJs are known for being shy and reserved when it comes to meeting new people. 
Since we have similar strengths and weaknesses, we won‚Äôt complement each other. 
This might also make it difficult for us to grow and develop into well-rounded individuals.

.   Introverted, but If I get to know you I can be extremely silly.  I love making off the wall remarks if I'm comfortable with you.


.  I hate traditions and religion.  Personally I find the both of these concepts pointless to me. To each his own I guess 

.  I love helping people,  but only those who needs it and want it. I don't want to save the world.  I just want to help people who really needs it. 


.   I'm not a pushover.  Most people considered me a really sweet guy.  However,  if I think you're getting disrespectful I will check you. 

.   I have an obsession  with my past.  I'm always thinking about my mom,stepdad,  and other love ones who passed away or left. Including my past mistakes. 

.  I'm really hard on myself.  If I make any mistakes at work or anything in general I overthink on how I can prevented my mistakes. This sometimes leads to a bad depression episode.  As an heavy equipment operator apprentice, I'm extremely hard on myself.  I even had my boss tell me more than once I'm to hard on myself and I am doing a good job.


.  I'm always thinking about the future and wondering how my life is going to play out. 


. I am extremely loyal to my friends and family.  But if you betray my trust or hurt me,  I will cut you out of  my life permanently.  Including family.

Before he left I was a little upset because we didn‚Äôt get to see each other even though we both said we wanted to. He calmed me down,  called me when I asked him to and we talked through it. We both might be in a position of moving in the next few months, him sooner than I but neither a sure thing by any means. He said he doesn‚Äôt want to get too deep into anything because of this.

Well, he just got back to town and he text me a bit (initiated by me) about his trip.

Practicality and resources aside, what would you do to contribute to society if money wasn't a factor?

I'm asking because I don't understand how any one person can *know* what they want to do with their lives ""career"" wise. Going to a 9-5 seems silly to me. Dressing up in professional clothes most people wouldn't otherwise wear, because it's company policy, seems silly to me (perhaps that's POLR Te talking). My INFJ family member knew from the time she was like 8, she wanted to be a literature professor, and she got her Masters at a very young age, and is a lit professor. I've had no clue, and still at the age of 29 don't. The idea of one linear path sounds boring. I'd love to do random things to make a living, but the lack of stability in that seems incredibly stressful. I'd love to podcast (who doesn't nowadays), but I feel I'm too boring, insecure, and lack the drive and discipline to meet people in which I can team up with to make it happen. I'd love to own a meditation studio, and provide yoga and meditation classes, but don't have the overhead, connections, or business know-how (not that I couldn't acquire that). But then thinking about what that really means, the back-end work, doesn't sound appealing in reality (just the teaching aspect, which isn't a feasible steady income stream). Am I destined, then, to work a basic 9-5? I very much hate that idea, but I also don't have any other ideas of how to make a feasible, stable living.

isfj,"Hello! :)
I'm really into this MBTI stuff and I had a lot of research about it (cognitive functions, even socioncs, enneagram, Big5 etc.) but still I'm not 100% sure about my type. What made me think that I'm an ISFJ is that I definitely recognise Si  and Fe in my function stack. I easely notice things that changed, I'm very aware of my phisical state (how can people forget to eat? :D), I like to collect things that remind of a pleasant or important event (like cinema tickets, the armband from when I was in hospital, and even candy papers :D), I have a lot of small routines (some times I'm sick of them, but if I don't go by them, I'm really guilty about it). So I think that's my Si. 
I think my Fe is not very much developed. What motivates me in my behavior toward others is to prevent them being angry with me. I very sensitive about someones negative feelings for me (when I notice this, I always freeze and don't know how to treat the person and the situation). So I really like to make people laugh, I often shock them with my weird,crazy, sometimes cruel,dark and inapropiet humor, but I always stop when I notice that someone is hurting.
I also think that I use Ti sometimes. I love to pinpoint logical inconsistency in theories, some of my friends call me critical. I love learning new concepts, I enjoy debating about scientific or philosolhical topics for hours.  I'm a sceptical and sarcastic person, very pessimistic about myself, but optimistic about others.
What made me doubt that I'm an ISFJ is that I loooove living in my mind. I've created multiple worlds in my head.

So, what do you think? Am I an ISFJ? Others have told me that I could be an INFJ,but I doubt it, I don't really understand how Ni works, no matter how much I read about it, and it's so rare too, I don't want to be one of the mistyped INFJs.

isfj,"Hello! 
I am seeking advice/ clarification on ISFJ behavior. We have been friends for a year now, met at work, and shared romantic interest which faded away for a few months when I stopped working as much because of school responsibilities. Now that I am working more again we see each other more. 
I am confused about ISFJs and their typical love language/ signals. Ever since we met we felt comfortable sitting close to each other and joking around. He would stare at me a lot when he thought I wasn‚Äôt paying attention, so much that other coworkers would tell me that he obviously liked me. 

However, I have been very direct with my advances which has brought him more confidence to compliment me more bluntly BUT he doesn‚Äôt admit that he likes me. 
All of my coworkers say how he gets ‚Äústuck‚Äù around me and I‚Äôm the only person he asks for help or hugs/ seeks affection from. 

I don‚Äôt understand! He‚Äôs terrible at texting so I assume he‚Äôs not interested so when I stop giving him my attention he seems butt hurt. I don‚Äôt understand, I feel I put way too much effort into initiating. Any ISFJ insight would be useful, dunno if ISFJs are really that shy or if I should just give up and poor my energy elsewhere. 

I‚Äôm also a very emotionally intelligent INTJ, in the sense that I‚Äôm not insensitive or purely logical and care about what others are feeling. He‚Äôs very logical to the point that he acts more ISTJ-ish but he keeps testing as an ISFJ. ",1527672103

isfj,"Newly dating! It's only been a week but it feels like months. Oddly, we're getting along quite well. MB says we compliment each other but we aren't a romantic match. However, we both do not like dating extroverts even though MB says that's what we should date. Has anyone ever dated in this combination? We're nearly identical, I guess I'm kind of looking for a couple of things... 

Since we are both introverts should we plan dates together like down to the silly details? We both love detailed planning.

We don't like receiving gifts but we both like giving them. lol Should we just suck it up and give each other flowers and notes?? 

We both like being productive at all times, should we set aside lazy time? 

I also feel like it was love at first sight for me!! I don't know if I should tell her or just go with the flow. I'm afraid to sound crazy, because I don't like it when people are overwhelming, so I'm sure she doesn't either. Of course, that could be my reserved personality. 

We are both really impressed with how alike we are and that we have the same goals and interests. We can also talk to each other for hours and hours. We have constant intelligent conversation and witty humor, it's a really nice chemistry. We like the same video games, movies, dates, topics, and life goals. It's really wild to have so much in common. It's so attractive! We both always thought opposites attract, and now we think that is wrong? (at least for some)

Anybody with answers or logical thoughts would be greatly appreciated!

isfj,"I'm at the point in my life where typically people start settling down with their partner, moving out and prepare for having a family. As a single person living in a city with high costs and extremely high housing prices, the financial pressures can be daunting. 

I love my independence for the most part, and my close-knit group allows me to be social and express myself emotionally. I never felt the need to be in a serious relationship and as an ISFJ, It takes me a hell of a long time to open up, build trust and put myself out there to date someone.

As I eventually enter this phase in my life of establishing my career, moving out and living alone, I realize I'm lacking the emotional aspect of having a companion. I've spent the past couple years focusing on saving money so that I will be in a financially favorable position, but no one to share the experience with or feed my ISFJ needs to support someone. 

I'm half panicking that I need start dating to speed up the time it takes for me to enter a serious relationship so it can catch up to my career/moving out timelines. At the same time, I'm fearful of ""settling"" for someone and regretting the decision by trying to accelerate the dating process.

TLDR: single, prioritized saving money and moving out over dating. ISFJ long dating process, scared to rush into a serious relationship in order to ""catch up"".

The part I‚Äôm struggling with most is how I spend my time. I‚Äôm a recently graduated 23yo F, and I just got my first job post-grad school in an amazing research lab (immunology) at one of the best universities in the world. I am so lucky to have this opportunity, and I still pinch myself sometimes that I‚Äôm here, but I find my self feeling *so* often that I‚Äôm not doing what I love or what I‚Äôm passionate about. This job is mentally exhausting, so by the time I‚Äôm done with work, I have little motivation to be social, explore hobbies, etc. I feel that I am constantly being emptied and don‚Äôt know how to fill myself back up.

I‚Äôm also so interested in understanding myself, understanding why we‚Äôre here, how to navigate life. So my mind automatically goes to ‚ÄúI should go back to school to be a therapist‚Äù (many people say that I am like an armchair therapist). While part of me thinks that would be an amazing career for me and it could be my ‚Äúpassion‚Äù, another big part thinks that I‚Äôm just running away from this life that I have now, and am hoping for happiness in the next stage. That the grass will be greener if I have a different job. Logically, I know this is probably not true, but it‚Äôs still an internal struggle nevertheless.

Even after I form new, meaningful connections, I still sometimes find myself thinking about people I used to know, even if my relationship with them was unhealthy, and I often miss them. 


I've been in a very healthy, happy, fulfilling relationship for just shy of 2 years now, and while I wouldn't change it at all, I still find myself missing an ex sometimes. 
I've moved on from that relationship, and I definitely wouldn't want to go back to it, but I catch myself wondering how he's doing sometimes, and missing the good times we had. 


I don't act on these feelings, and I usually just leave the past where it belongs, but sometimes I feel guilty when I'm lying there with this amazing guy who I love to death, and I feel a pang of nostalgia for times I had with an ex.

Why do they hint that they want you to show appreciation by going on about how hard they've been working?

Do they not think sometimes or does it just seem that way because of the ISFJ I've been around? The ISFJ will do things, but it's like their process is ""duty"", ""I feel they'll like this"" but not ""Will they like this?"" It's like it completely slips their mind that they've told them something regarding what they get the past 500 times.

Why do they articulate so strangely (this coming from an INTP)? They'll say things like ""I'm a Star Wars."" or ""Pokeman"". It seems they'll have trouble articulating abstract thoughts which, in my experience, can come off as ""stupid"" to the INTP when in reality, it's similar to the INTP's difficulty in articulating and expressing their feelings. What I don't understand is why they word things the way they do. I don't recall noticing any other type do that. ""A Star Wars""??? What makes them think that's correct grammar??

isfj,"I have a problem. As an INTP, I often go straight from Ne to Si. Because of this, I have trouble taking action like an SP. Ne is what I like to call the ""in a sec"" function for NPs. Si is what I like to call the ""just in case"" function for INPs. They're often either future-oriented or past-oriented and become increasingly more in their head. NPs can take action, but they're often just chasing reward. When they try to jump into a cold shower, there's a mental barrier in the way. At best, they'll ease themselves into it.

SPs manage to take action easily. They're present-oriented. When I say ""present-oriented"", I'm not referring to the limiting of future and past-orientedness. The present is its own thing just as the past and future are. When you're in the present, you're IN the present.

When Se is being used, it's as if they're immersed in the extroverted world in the present, immersed in sensations. They see the black and &amp; white, not what's going on behind the scenes or the inner workings.

I once activated my Se. The mental barrier was virtually non-existent. I reacted MUCH faster. I'd set my intention and do it. I was IN the moment. It's as if I was looking at the external world outside of my head as if I, as opposed to being in my head, was in the extroverted world IN the present. The book I had been wanting to read but haven't touched in months was easily picked up with virtually no mental resistance.

I've tried getting ISTPs and ISFPs to explain how to enter this state of mind, but I think there was a communication barrier. They were having trouble articulating with precision. They explained it but in an Se way which isn't informative enough for me. I'm not sure how ESXPs will be of much more help.

If he hasn‚Äôt made any move by now, I assume he isn‚Äôt interested, and just didn‚Äôt want to tell that to my earlier. 

I told him I would talk to him today about something, but didn‚Äôt feel like it was the right time as we were both super tired. So now I‚Äôm just wondering if I should straight out text him. 

I don‚Äôt even know what to say though without coming off as needy. I need a way to explain to him that I still harbor these feelings and would like to know how he feels, and that it‚Äôs best to define what‚Äôs going on between us because I don‚Äôt even know what to feel anymore with all this ambiguity.

For example, I *want* to learn about capitalism, and I've an introductory book, but I don't have the willingness to read. My brain can't absorb anything I'm forced to.

I have to walk on eggshells when I talk to some of my friends. I'm understanding, considerate, and helpful. But, sometimes I hate their sensitivity. I hate their weakness and find it stupid. I do my best not to let them know what I think, but sometimes I slip. I don't want to let go of them because I really do care for them (and also because I'd be lonely and friendless again, which would fucking spiral me down to depression all over again.)

I also have friends who are too smart, matured and developed for me to handle. I can't keep up with them most of the time.

Anyways, I have this thing i do. it's a crutch i've developed to deal with the depression. and the crutch is  basically to deal with any problems or issues i have immediately.

if i'm sad, i must recognize it, dissect it, understand it, solve it or let it go. same with anger or any strong negative emotion.

i don't allow myself to wallow. both to save time and go straight toward solving it but to also not give myself the chance to let it pull me back to who i used to be all those years ago. someone who was depressed, angry, egotistical, and suicidal and an emotional burden on others.

my therapist says that i can't cut it out cold turkey because i need it to live basically. and i need to learn to slowly be comfortable with myself and simmer in problems and believe i can do it safely from time to time. she also told me that i chances are I become an asshole so i should stop fearing that. 

but i still find that it's something that makes me incredibly alienating and makes it hard to help or comfort people due to a lack of empathy in their need to wallow a bit. and i fear it pushes people away. and i guess i'm frustrated with it. and i'm looking for a solution to it as i always do. or maybe this is good for me, to vent like this. and just be frustrated that i have to be frustrated.

I only mentioned that to put things in perspective. My thinking is not exactly normal or orderly. ISFJs always seem to have valuable insight and tend to see concrete solutions where I cannot. I have been beating myself up recently over many things. 

1. I was supposed to go out of town and stay with a family member for ten days. I made it one night and one day and ended up coming home the second night. 

2. I am at the age where I am supposed to decide what I want to do and begin figuring out my life. I have an INTJ parent and an ESFJ parent. They both understand me in different ways, but neither of them fully understands me. I am beating myself up because I can't figure out what I want to do + I feel like I am a failure and will always be a failure. 

3. As mentioned above, I feel like I will never succeed. I am in the INFP Hermit Mode, currently. (Basically the dark side of INFPs, falling into a state of mental illness and physically frozen and cut off from the outside world. On average I have left my house less than twice a week for the past two years. I don't have any true friends anymore, they either ignore me or just don't care.) Being in Hermit mode, I don't want to do anything. I know that I need to get a job and I want to start providing for myself/working, but at the same time I feel like I won't be able to hold a job or do anything properly. 

There's more, but honestly I don't even know how this post will go over.

**PS. I love you, ISFJ. You all are so kind, caring, and helpful. Anytime I've ever needed help, the ISFJ in my life has been amazing. Here on reddit you all have been amazing. If this post isn't okay or appreciated, just let me know. I just like having the input of other personality types and most of the other types don't care enough/are generally mean about things. You all are almost always kind, gentle, and you genuinely care. I'm not trying to use you to solve my problems, I just appreciate and request your special outlook on the world.**

Imo, my major role in their life is to help and assist. The act itself of helping AND receiving their validation from doing so makes me happy. I'm vocal about my disagreements in some of their decisions and ideas, but I will still support them anyway - like how Alfred is vocal that Bruce is crazy for doing Batman stuff and he should stop, yet he still supports him.

Alfred once said, ""I will always be here to patch you up."" Well, that's exactly what I do. 

Now, on those times Batman does something rude to Alfred, Alfred doesn't hesitate to put Batman in his place. One time Batman insulted Alfred so hard that Alfred slapped Batman in the face. They both calmed down and gave each other space, but in the end Alfred was still all ""fuck it, I'll still be here for you damn you.""

Being introverted and keeping it inside has not been ideal, but I struggle with finding a way to express my the immense amount of grief I feel on the daily.  

The only person I felt close enough to share my thoughts with would have been my twin who took his life.  My wife has been helpful but the relationship they had makes it difficult to to fully open up to her.

I‚Äôm doing grief counseling which helps, but it‚Äôs not like having a friend to confide in.  I also do a support group which I am sure most of you an imagine doesn‚Äôt help too much.  I speak up plenty for an introvert, I just don‚Äôt like sharing what‚Äôs really going on inside my head.  I‚Äôd rather offer insights to people and help them than share my problems with the group.  

I‚Äôve read a few books, tried to use the experience/knowledge from them but I still can‚Äôt seem to get back to normal.

isfj,"My partner is ISFJ and I have a hard time interpreting what he‚Äôs thinking, so I‚Äôm asking for some perspective from like minded people.
He has some ideas of ‚Äúcloseness, intimacy and warm family bonds‚Äù that I find I am unable to live up to as a partner. He‚Äôs always on about how we aren‚Äôt close enough, intimate enough, and it‚Äôs serious enough to him that he‚Äôs moved out.

We have been together for five years, living together for three years. We have a toddler. Well, we are splitting, his choice. This past weekend,  I guess he has some spare time in his new place, because he started answering emails, which he almost never does, and he somehow discovered that I use Facebook, and that I‚Äôve done so for years. 

This is what he wrote to me in an email:

‚Äú... I realized that you have an entire separate life you're sharing on Facebook with your friends, pictures and comments going back many years, and I'd never seen any of them until today. Precious pictures of our toddler even comments from my own family members that I have never seen, strange. This strikes me as really odd and a bit disturbing. It's not that your posts are disturbing, but what bothers me is now discovering that you are in this whole other world -- Facebook -- and I simply had no idea of the degree you used Facebook.
It seems to me that we've been leading separate intimate lives for so long and I never knew¬† -- you share your important photos and thoughts on Facebook -- and I had not seen any of them until now. It makes me feel very sad because it's clear we're apparently so different in the way we communicate with family and friends....‚Äù

So now Facebook has gone and depressed him. I‚Äôm flummoxed. He‚Äôs a friend on my Facebook, so is a lot of both of families and I post regularly for everybody, and they reply.  It‚Äôs like he thinks I kept Facebook secret from him, and posted. He seems to forget Facebook is a public forum, which he is part of and so is a lot of his family. 

Actually he‚Äôs the one who never ever logs into social media. He‚Äôs very bad at keeping track of things and answering emails, texts, never uses other social media either. He‚Äôs very much an introvert who values his alone time in his office with his podcasts.

So, the way I think, if I had found something like that, I would think it‚Äôs great, a treasure trove of cool and memories, and comments from people, freely available. A wonderful trip down memory lane. And if I‚Äôve done something cool that he likes, why isn‚Äôt it worth a thumbs up. And if I‚Äôm so different from him in how I communicate, why doesn‚Äôt he think that is awesome too?

It‚Äôs been a real problem for me, that in this relationship, I could never live up to the ideals of ‚Äúcloseness and intimacy‚Äù he has in his head. And that he puts all the responsibility on me for failing to do this, without considering my perspective, that I am an independent type of person (I am ISTP). It seems he is consumed by his own perspective.

 It just seems that this is another example of how I don‚Äôt measure up, and he doesn‚Äôt consider my general good intentions.

isfj,"Hey everyone. I'm an ISFJ male who's been in a relationship with an ENTJ female for the past few months, and all in all, things have been going very well. Even though we are undoubtedly *extremely* different in how we approach problems in our daily lives, we both find our difference in perspective to be enriching and complementary, covering each others' flaws. But in all this there is one thing that we haven't seen eye-to-eye at all, and that's on drinking alcohol (well, high-risk behaviors in general, but alcohol being the most frequent topic.)

For context, I'm the type of person who is very rules- and experience-based in my approach to drinking. I did not start drinking until I was 21, and even then, my tolerance is extremely low, often leading to bad experiences with alcohol, even when I was careful. Lately I have gotten much better at holding my drinks, but to this day I really do not see the appeal of drinking at all, and thus limit drinking only to special occasions (maybe once or twice a month).

On the other hand, my ENTJ girlfriend drinks reasonably often (typically between 1-3 times a week). That said, she is extremely responsible with her drinking - she's never felt ill from drinking, nor have any major issues arisen as a result of her drinking. And yet, every time she drinks, I find that I'm beside myself with worry, even though she's never done anything to warrant it. Lately I've expressed my concerns, but she insists that I not worry about her drinking habits. I totally understand that I shouldn't be worried, but I find myself always getting anxious about her drinking, even though it's not my responsibility. I don't want my own fears to get in the way of our relationship, so I know that I need to change.

What I want to know is if anyone else has gone through this before, and how you deal with anxiety in general.

Below is an overview of the Big 5 for those who are unfamiliar.

-----

[*From wikipedia:*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits)

&gt; * **Openness** to experience (inventive/curious vs. consistent/cautious)  
Appreciation for art, emotion, adventure, unusual ideas, curiosity, and variety of experience. Openness reflects the degree of intellectual curiosity, creativity and a preference for novelty and variety a person has. It is also described as the extent to which a person is imaginative or independent and depicts a personal preference for a variety of activities over a strict routine. High openness can be perceived as unpredictability or lack of focus, and more likely to engage in risky behaviour or drug taking. Also, individuals that have high openness tend to lean towards being artists or writers in regards to being creative and appreciate the significance of the intellectual and artistic pursuits. Moreover, individuals with high openness are said to pursue self-actualization specifically by seeking out intense, euphoric experiences. Conversely, those with low openness seek to gain fulfillment through perseverance and are characterized as pragmatic and data-driven‚Äîsometimes even perceived to be dogmatic and closed-minded. Some disagreement remains about how to interpret and contextualize the openness factor.

&gt;* **Conscientiousness** (efficient/organized vs. easy-going/careless)  
A tendency to be organized and dependable, show self-discipline, act dutifully, aim for achievement, and prefer planned rather than spontaneous behavior. High conscientiousness is often perceived as stubbornness and obsession. Low conscientiousness is associated with flexibility and spontaneity, but can also appear as sloppiness and lack of reliability.

&gt;* **Extraversion** (outgoing/energetic vs. solitary/reserved)  
Energy, positive emotions, surgency, assertiveness, sociability and the tendency to seek stimulation in the company of others, and talkativeness. High extraversion is often perceived as attention-seeking, and domineering. Low extraversion causes a reserved, reflective personality, which can be perceived as aloof or self-absorbed. Extroverted people tend to be more dominant in social settings, opposed to introverted people who may act more shy and reserved in this setting.

&gt;* **Agreeableness** (friendly/compassionate vs. challenging/detached)  
A tendency to be compassionate and cooperative rather than suspicious and antagonistic towards others. It is also a measure of one's trusting and helpful nature, and whether a person is generally well-tempered or not. High agreeableness is often seen as naive or submissive. Low agreeableness personalities are often competitive or challenging people, which can be seen as argumentativeness or untrustworthiness.

&gt;* **Neuroticism** (sensitive/nervous vs. secure/confident)  
Neuroticism identifies certain people who are more prone to psychological stress. The tendency to experience unpleasant emotions easily, such as anger, anxiety, depression, and vulnerability. Neuroticism also refers to the degree of emotional stability and impulse control and is sometimes referred to by its low pole, ""emotional stability"". A high stability manifests itself as a stable and calm personality, but can be seen as uninspiring and unconcerned. A low stability expresses as a reactive and excitable personality, often very dynamic individuals, but they can be perceived as unstable or insecure. It has also been researched that individuals with higher levels of tested neuroticism, tend to have worse psychological well being.

[*From a peer-reviewed paper:*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0191886996000335):

&gt;The NEO-PI Agreeableness score was correlated only with the thinking-feeling (T-F) dimension; the NEO-PI Conscientiousness score was correlated with both thinking-feeling and judging-perceiving (J-P) dimension; the NEO-PI Extraversion score was strongly correlated with the extraversion-introversion (E-I) dimensions, while the Neuroticism score from the NEO-PI was not related to any MBTI subscale score. The openness dimension was correlated with all four especially sensing-intuitive.",1521647911

Her: omgomgomgomg I messaged Jake 2 hours ago and he hasn't gotten back to me yet. I think he's ghosting me. 

Me: It's the middle of a work day. He's probably just busy.

isfj,"You don't have to have your shit together all the time. It's okay to vent, go crazy, have a nervous breakdown, or have a cathartic release. More importantly, it's okay to share how you're feeling with other people. You're not letting anybody down. You're some of the most kind, caring, and responsible people, but even you should get to be human sometimes. Nobody will judge you if you need to let everything out. It's good to set a good example for others, but it's impossible to do so all the time, because you're human too.

isfj,"I am an INTJ, and I am dating an ISFJ girl. I am mostly wanting to change myself to the extent that I can make my SO be more comfortable and happy.

I am always getting the feeling that she is getting bored and wants to date someone who is careless so that she can scrutinize them and forgive them, so that she can look like a most ""graceful"" person. As an INTJ, I think I am pretty good at arguing, and support my arguments with too much logic. I think that she feels like she isn't getting anywhere because she wants to improve something that is broken or open up a ""hethen's"" eyes and they become eternally grateful to her.

I'm not going to lie, I tend to get a bit paranoid about her and try to get her to slip some words of what she is ""really doing"". I have no clue if she is doing anything, but the type of person I am is different than the type she grew up with. I am a confrontational guy, that thinks really long and hard about the consequences of my actions, while the guys she grew up with were all country guys livin' wild and ""asking for forgiveness, not permission"". The type of guys who say they'll be better, then do the same crap in a couple months.

Point is- I think she's lovely and that she'd be a great mother, but I'm afraid of fully committing to someone who will end up having an affair in the future because she seems like she romanticizes being wanted and having the ""burden"" of choosing between her current relationship and the possibility of the one she's (possibly) starting.

I'm not trying to make anybody on this sub defensive, so please don't berate me. I'm just putting what's on my mind on text and seeing how some of you ISFJ girls relate to this? Did you need more time being single? What do you romanticize about? What would be hard for you to resist when it comes to a man being interested in you? Is an affair more interesting than a long-term relationship(is it worth the risk)? What's the closest you've come to these things?

Remember I'm trying to change my behaviors to suits her and keeps her around for the rest of my life. I want to work on myself for her. Your responses may help me do that.",1520045218

isfj,"Hi, I recently just found out that I am an ISFJ. Reading the description about it, it is completely 100% relatable for me.

Well here is a little background of me. Since high school, I have always been quite social and knows a lot of people here and there but I don't really have a deep connection with anyone even my few best friends. Not that I don't enjoy their company, but something is definitely missing from it. For example, like when we are in a group of 3, 2 of my friends will be very compatible with each other and I will mostly hear them talking and only sometimes participate in their conversation. Most probably, this is because I don't really open up with anybody (I can't and mostly I don't know what bothers me the whole time). But still I am very grateful to have them in my life, but at the same time I feel like something is wrong with me.

Now that I am in uni, same thing still happen to me that I think would change. I met people here and there and made some very close friends too. People around me said I am a kind and genuine friends because I really like to help people. But still, I am always out of chemistry with anyone when things started to get personal. I never want to let my problems spilled to others as it will make me somehow vulnerable. Things I hate is that people took me for granted like I didn't matter like almost invisible sometimes.

All the traits that ISFJ have really reflected on me. Sometimes I feel like I don't want to be such a sensitive person, you know just like the person that doesn't give a shit. Sometimes I feel like I don't need to have approval from others. Sometimes I just want to be a carefree person and do whatever the fuck i want without any hesitation. With this things revolves around me, everything really seems unpleasant to me. (friends,relationships, careers etc.)

Then again, I really only want to be the person to easily express my feeling and not be easily taken granted of. So I am just wondering if anybody here has been in this shoes before, and how did they go against this natural personality?

TLDR ; I feel like crap being too available for everyone and being taken for granted most of the time even actually I did it genuinely. I hate this conflicting stuff about me that wanting to have approval from others as well as genuinely helping them at the same time. Most of my friends seems unnatural around me (or I might have overthink this). How would you go away around solving this issue?",1519967440
isfj,"I personally hate them and am honestly scared of them. I'm at a point where if someone I know reveals, ""I'm an INTP"" - I'd distance the fuck away from them.

Anyone else?",1519920321
isfj,"So this might be slightly lengthy, but to sum it up, I have a suspicion that my ISFJ friend is gay (I'm gay too) and that he likes me to some extent. We have been friends for nearly nine years, with our friendship being very off and on. As kids, we were really good friends, but he was very introverted and hardly did anything with anyone.  His family is LDS, with his mom being a very domineering ESTJ. His mom had always made sure he went on dates, went to dances, did his religious duties, etc...and my ISFJ friend always seemed very boxed in personality-wise because of how controlling his mother is. As a senior in High School, he dated a girl ""seriously"" for TWO years...and they kissed ONCE for like maybe two seconds (literally). Afterward, my ISFJ friend said it felt ""weird"" and ""confusing"" and that he didn't know how he felt. No matter what, he is terrible around girls. Like TERRIBLE...and it is so bizarre because he is hot as hell. It's like he is forcing himself and trying to convince himself that he needs to act a certain way around them, which completely backfires. 

Fast forward to college. My ISFJ friend and I haven't spoken for quite a while (two 1/2 years), and we happened to be in the same History class this semester. Since then, our friendship has reignited and actually been a LOT better than when we were kids (I was annoying as hell and he was so introverted it was insane). He still lives at home and he goes on dates, but all of them pretty much go nowhere because of A) his awkwardness and B) his inability to keep things moving forward with them. Lately, he has been ""dating"" this girl, and when I asked how far they had gone he said ""Well...not at all really..."" and I was like ""Haha, what? What do you mean? Have you even held hands?"" and he was like ""No. I just...can't. Like I don't know why but I just don't want to hold her hand but at the same time I do but it just feels weird to think about."" and I was like ""Hmm...interesting...""

So, as the semester has gone by, we have hung out a ton, we text a lot (In ISFJ terms which is like...not much since ISFJ aren't the most talkative unless you really get them going), and he literally laughs at like...EVERYTHING I say. After class, I will walk with him sometimes to his next class and we will sit outside of his other classroom and I will do my ENTP thing and rant and talk a lot and he will sit there and laugh and sometimes he will even blush. In class I will catch him kind of just looking over at me from the corner of my eye for longer than just a glance. At the beginning of the semester, I asked him if he wanted to go play tennis with me after school on Thursdays, so we do that and its the same thing: Me talking, asking him questions, and him laughing and listening and answering. 

Again, all of this couldddd just be ""We are good friends so why not laugh""...but the thing is, when we are all hanging out with our ""group"" of friends, he will make a point to sit with me and it seems like he is always making an excuse to touch me in some way, and if I look back at him he will look away and stop doing it (not that I mind if he does...in fact I don't at all) and turn a little red and say ""Oh...sorry.""

A few days ago in school, I was like ""Got any plans after school today?"" and he said ""Yea... I got a date."" Me ""Oh. Dang..."" and then he quickly said with this worried look on his face, ""Oh but she asked me. Like I usually wouldn't have asked her or anything but she asked me first. Sorry..."" Like he looked worried I would be offended by it, and I was like ""Haha, no it's okay. Are we still on for Thursday?"" And he was like ""Haha, yea of course. I love being able to spend time with you. It's kind of the highlight of my day, haha."" And I looked away, trying to hide my half smile as my mind was simultaneously going ""WTF"".

...but I can't tell if he is secretly in to me, or if he is just a super awkward ISFJ who feels obligated to laugh at the things I say because...ya know... Fe and religion. And...here's another catch- his aunt is gay and she was completely disowned by the entire family. Literally no one talks to this aunt. Maybe this is stretch, but I'm wondering if the reason he is so awkward and stuff is if he saw what happened to his aunt so is terrified of being gay because of what his family would do and because of religious reasons. Are devoute closeted religious ISFJs even aware they're gay?! BUT I CAN'T TELL. He just seems to flirt with me SO MUCH. Who dates someone for two years ""seriously"" and never even really kisses them?! Who feels uncomfortable holding hands with someone they ""really like""?!? He seems completely comfortable around me- like so much so that I think he is INTO me.

* Doesn't care about appearances at all. Not her own, not her friends'. I mean she either has bad taste or really can care less about what people think. 

* Can live without her phone. Like seriously. She can go for days without checking her phone. She hates social media too. She doesn't even set profile pictures.

Same cannot be said about everyone, some are less patient, less able to relate to what I'm saying etc. Good listener, I daresay. She gets my weird, dark, ironic, sarcastic and farce-y humour too.

isfj,"Hi everyone. 

I‚Äôve recently (about 2 weeks) gone exclusive with an isfj female whom I‚Äôd been talking with and dating for about 6 weeks in total. 

She told me she‚Äôs never had a boyfriend before but has been great on the first four dates we had. 

On the fourth date, she randomly brought up that she has deleted her dating apps and when I asked her why ‚Äúshe said that she didn‚Äôt need them anymore because she met me‚Äù. I then asked if we were official and she replied ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see any reason why we shouldn‚Äôt be‚Äù but asked if I wouldn‚Äôt post it on Facebook as she likes to keep things private. 
However, since then, she‚Äôs gradually got quieter and quieter. We used to message 10+ times a day (good lengthy messages too) and send each regular snaps. 
We‚Äôve had 3 more dates since the 4th date and spent Valentines afternoon together. On these previous dates, she‚Äôs been really quiet but will still talk a fair amount, just a lot less than normal. 

She seems to want to keep seeing me as she said that on her card, but she just keeps getting quieter. Yesterday we sent a total of 2 messages and they were initiated by me (my third message she didn‚Äôt even read but was active repeatedly, which is cool with me as I understand she has lots of people to talk to, however, a week ago she would have replied within an hour or two).

I‚Äôve been speaking to an ISFJ women (23) for almost 4 weeks. We met on Bumble and have met up twice. We kissed on the first date (and also the second) and became more intimate on the second date (lots of cuddling, holding hands but not much more as we were in public). 

We message a few times a day and generally just talk about our days. However, when we meet up, we talk about many different topics and have a great time (at least it appears that way). 

We have a lot in common and hold a lot of the same beliefs/values. 

Even though I‚Äôve only seen her twice I feel like I‚Äôm really starting to fall for her, and I‚Äôm trying to work out if she‚Äôs the same. 

The main doubts in my mind are: sometimes when I‚Äôm talking, she‚Äôs easily distracted by someone else coming into the shop/bar/place where we are and occasionally will look around the room. I‚Äôm not sure if this is disinterest in me as she can recall pretty much anything I tell her in detail, so she appears to be listening. 

Also, when we are messaging (and this is going to sound really silly but it confuses me) we end our message with kisses ‚Äúx‚Äù. This gets automatically capitalised after any form of punctuation like so ‚ÄúX‚Äù, however, she changes it to the lower case ‚Äúx‚Äù sometimes. Again, this sounds silly, but when you think about it, she‚Äôs actually making an effort to change the size of the kiss (which I‚Äôve never thought about until she did it). She doesn‚Äôt convert it to lower case all the time which is what confuses me too. This is an arguably insignificant point but I‚Äôm not sure why she does it. Perhaps it indicates a deeper emotional response. 

She‚Äôs told me that she‚Äôs never had a boyfriend before but is looking to date and strikes me as the sort of person who wants a meaningful and committed relationship (from what she‚Äôs talked about so far). 

She does seem pretty shy and when I compliment her she blushes and will either say thanks or is like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how to react‚Äù which is fair enough. She‚Äôs complimented me too, but usually after I compliment her. 

I know this is incredibly hard to tell from just a text post, but I‚Äôm wondering if this is more an ISFJ thing about concealing feelings, not wanting to come across too strong or if she genuinely doesn‚Äôt know herself. 

Thanks for any help/advice on the matter :)

TL;DR: speaking to and dating an ISFJ for almost a month, been on two dates, kissed her on both dates, I‚Äôve made it clear I like her and I think she likes me, can sometimes appear as if she‚Äôs not listening to my end of the conversation, deliberately changes the kisses in a message, possibly to make them seem less significant (just guessing), seems to be pretty reserved in terms of revealing feelings and won‚Äôt compliment me much unless I compliment her first.

isfj,"Hey guys. :) I'm trying to figure out my type and I'm stuck between ISFJ and a few other types. I have a few questions that I'm hoping to get ISFJ perspective on. Thanks for any help you can give!

Is it true that ISFJs are comfortable dealing with lots of little detailed things? For example, working on taxes... does keeping track of all those detailed things you might need in order to complete that not bother you? Or another example, if you were working on a painting and there was a need to focus on doing small detailed lines, this sort of thing wouldn't bother you? Sorry for the weird examples, lol.

Do you guys tend to take things people say at face value, or do you often 'read between the lines' and think they really mean something else?

Would you say ISFJs are generally fairly present focused, like 'in the moment' people? I've heard some ISFJs say they are a mixture of in the moment and past oriented, but I've heard other ISFJs/ISTJs talk as if they are more purely focused on the present. Which do you think is more accurate for the typical ISFJ? Is it rare/uncommon for ISFJs to spend a good deal of time thinking about and/or planning for the future?

Is it common for ISFJs to naturally consider many different perspectives/angles when trying to understand a person/idea/topic? Like naturally seeing multiple perspectives to different situations? I've seen this more often attributed to Ni-doms but I wanted to know if ISFJs are this way as well.",1517178004

isfj,"Hi, so I don't at all mean this in a negative way and I really doubt all ISFJs are this way, but my mom is an ISFJ (she took the test) and she embodies that stereotype of passive-agressiveness. When she's mad, her words always seem to have a double meaning. Like, for example: we always celebrate christmas with our only family, but this year her brother cancelled in order to go skiing at his chalet and she's been pissy with him ever since. Yet, you have to make an effort to actually discern she's angry. She'll say stuff to him like: "" Well, we(our family) don't lead an exciting life, like you do. We always stay at home.""

She'll often say stuff like this to me too, like criticizing me but subtle enough that you maybe wouldn't notice at first, if it wasn't for her tone. To the ISFjs familiar with this: what causes it? Is it because you are so focused on keeping the peace, that you don't want to outright get angry? This will sound weird, but I'd rather she'd get angry, cause sometimes I don't know where I stand with her. She'll also do this thing, where she says she's okay with something, but then clearly makes it noticeable she's not. 

I'm gay for example, she has known this for years(Well, I never really ""came out"", but she knew I was attracted to girls.) and in front of my therapist she'll say: ""I just want her to be happy, I don't care."" But then at home, she'll again say subtle slightly homophobic stuff. This week she got really worked up over a lesbian colleague's baby having two surnames cause it has two moms, like it seemed to really annoy her. Another friend of hers is in a relationship with another woman, after divorcing her husband and she keeps wondering what ""caused"" it. She feels really strongly about what other people say and do. If I feel bad about this, she'll say she feels she has nothing to apologize for, cause it isn't about me. But with the baby, that could very well be me in the future. I get that she grew up in another generation and that she likes tradition. But I am very traditional and romantic too, I just happen to be gay. I can not change that: believe me, I tried.

 I really love my mom and she has gone through great lengths to always do what's best for me: I love how she can be really caring and sweet. I just feel like sometimes she has two faces and it frustrates me.

Do you know of any communication tips I could use to better our relationship. What do ISFJs need? What makes them comfortable? I hate that she feels like she has to hide her true emotions.",1517054857

isfj,"(May include a lot of cognitive function stereotypes that uncannily apply to me (^: )

Hey, so I've been at a stump for a while about whether I am an ISFJ or an INFJ. I've done extensive research into the cognitive functions, but still get stuck on determining whether I'm either of the two, mostly due to the fact that I see both the dominant functions of both in me.

The argument for ISFJ:
I often find myself in a flow-like state while thinking about the past, and I don't mean simple daydreaming, I mean literally almost reliving the past, going into extensive detail often reviewing the past few days before me, completely lost in thought while analyzing the past. The thing is, I don't really see myself making decisions based on the past, nor drawing conclusions on the past (which is something I often see described in the Si-dom descriptions). I definitely use Fe, but it's apparent that it's not my dominant function as it developed later in life.

The argument for INFJ:
l relate to Ni dominant on such an intimate level. In nearly all the descriptions I've read into Ni-dom, I've related to nearly everything, that is except for the most mentioned quality: being future oriented. In regards to the other qualities, such as being able to connect pieces of information to make accurate inferences (this might actually be Ne, idk, I've had about a 2 year hiatus in my research), and from these inferences be able to seemingly predict future outcomes. Another thing that, while very almost cliche is that I feel very misunderstood, I don't mean the fleeting feeling every now and then, I mean everything I say, my persona, it doesn't click with other people. I spend countless minutes and even hours staying silent while observing the people around me, using my Fe to get a feel for the flow of the conversation around me, and to replicate the behaviors for whichever group I happen to be in, but I always get confused looks, as if I'm speaking another language. Even past social interactions, when I am explaining something such as a concept I have to dumb it down so much so that other people will understand what I am saying, because my mind can skip beats and make connections that are not so easy to convey in words, but only to experience.

By the way, if you have any challenges/questions that help people determine their dominant function by tracking their mindset, they would be greatly appreciated, especially if they relate to Si and Ni more.

Her not being at home was a definite plus. It's different if she's in the other room or out of the house completely.

All of these things have contributed to my current state of mind, and I find myself getting easily annoyed/frustrated with human beings in general, even though I don't show it (now in the process of learning to be more assertive and express my dislikes/feelings to people).

Things that currently irritate/frustrate me to tears:

- NEGATIVITY! People that complain alot about situations, people or their own lives, when it is unnecessary. #1stWorldProblems irk me no end. Also hate hearing people discriminate against someone, even if I dislike the person they are discriminating against. Hearing negative/nasty, bitchy or shady comments about others or myself. People that don't compliment anyone or anything but are quick to point out what they don't like or tear someone/thing down.

- People that copy me!! I form attachments to things and feel like they are 'mine', so when a friend buys the same perfume/item of clothing/etc as me, I don't like it. I won't say anything, as I realise that this is my own issue, but I especially hate when someone copies one of my favourite things and then RECOMMENDS it to me and others, as if they discovered it! 

- People that talk for long periods about things that don't necessarily interest me but I listen and respond, but then don't reciprocate when I try to talk about something. I used to think I spoke too much or I was boring so I stopped talking about myself completely for most of my teens and early 20s. Now I have realised that people are inherently selfish and will use you as a sounding board and don't want you to talk back unless it's about them. I have either addressed it, cut off or stopped listening as intently to them in return. This happens with the majority of people I interact with; finding someone to listen to me for more than just a one off or crisis occasion has been a lifelong struggle. I remember crying about feeling like an alien/agony aunt that nobody cared about, at 12 years old; seems like not much has changed 10+ years later.

- People who say one thing and do another. I am aware we all are capable of changing our minds, but I have an ENFP friend who does this to the extreme and it drives me insane! 
Example conversation:
ENFP: I'm really craving a cheeseburger 
Me: (not craving cheeseburger but willing to eat cheeseburgers to see ENFP happy) Shall we go get cheeseburgers? :)
ENFP: Why would I eat a cheeseburger? Are you trying to make me fat? You're plotting against me, I see you.
 This is mostly annoying because I build my inventory of people's likes and dislikes based on what they say/do, so that u can better accommodate them and make them comfortable/do or buy things that they really like. Conversations like the above, however, really mess with my Si lol

- Judgemental people. People that make you feel weird or odd for doing things differently than them, or who shame you by name calling, making faces/comments of disapproval or by forcing you to conform to what they think is normal. Even when this isn't directed towards me, I severely dislike it

isfj,"Hey, I am a fellow ISFJ and I've come to realize I am truly terrible at self care sometimes. Part of this realization actually came from reading this amazing board that I only discovered recently. Thank you &lt;3 

I'm usually not one for resolutions because I don't like making promises I can't keep or don't think I'll follow through on. But I want to make self care a priority this year.

After a really recent horrible experience I've come to realize I have impulse control disorder (I already knew I have anxiety/OCD issues and it is usually tied to these types of disorders).. I can even pretty much explain how I came to be this way and understand that other people in my family seem to share some of these traits as well or have other components of this disorder I don't share (ie. chronic gambling issues, substance abuse problems). 

Issues I've struggled with over the years that stem from impulse control disorder include trichotillomania (not a huge issue in my life but hair pulling happens on a daily basis since it began around age 7), kleptomania (finally was able to get away from this after getting arrested as a teenager but it took a lot of work), impulse buying stuff I didn't need or even want at times, skin picking (more of an issue as a kid), and several times in my life, intermittent explosive disorder. The explosive thing has only happened  a handful of times in my life.. but it happened recently and I am still reeling from the shame of what happened. 

This is an explanation of what that is: IED is characterized by recurrent, significant outbursts of aggression, often leading to assaults against people or property, which are disproportionate to outside stressors and not better explained by another psychiatric diagnosis. Individuals suffering from IED regard their behavior as distressing and problematic. Outbursts are generally short-lived (usually less than 30 minutes) and frequent (multiple times per month). Legal and occupational difficulties are common. Recent research suggests that IED may be common, with 6.3% of a community sample meeting criteria. 

I don't know if anxiety, ocd, or impulse control issues are more common with ISFJs but I do see that we seem to forget to take care of ourselves because we're always trying to help everyone else out/put others first. Honestly, I think that's what caused me to explode this time (not taking care of my needs, ignoring triggers that would cause me to act this way) and I'm sorry for all of this rambling but I feel like this board is full of people who actually get me.. or know how it feels to be this way, even when you don't want to be sometimes.

What do you do to help remember self care? What kinds of things do you do? I feel relieved to put a name to what I've been experiencing since I was a child but also pretty bummed and ashamed about it. We are very sensitive people and I just keep reliving the crappy thing I did.. I want to make sure I don't have to feel that way again if at all possible. ",1515015078
isfj,"Hey guys and gals, 21 M ENTP student here. 

I honestly wish I could be more like you all. Because of my Ti and Ne, my GPA seemed to have dropped incredibly low to the point where I don't know if I will graduate. 

How do you guys manage to stay so focused? I've tried to develop habits I learnt from my ESFJ dad like writing up a schedule and trying to follow it but my Ti just takes over and I start going on wikipedia to learn about why turtles swim (for example). It works fine for about 2 weeks or so and then I just lose focus. I just don't get how I stop that from happening. 

It's gotten to the point where it just gets super annoying and I end up rushing on almost every assignment and handing it in last minute. I even end up missing lunch/dinner just because I was procrastinating the entire day.",1515002884
isfj,"Hey guys, I'm forwarding my type me post to here, because it was suggested I'm ISFJ. I'm very confused about which type I am, so if anyone has time to read, I'd appreciate. 

**1.What makes you respect individuals, groups, or organizations? List whatever you can think of.**

I really respect people who take a big picture perspective and are capable of listening without interjecting with their own experience. I really respect people who learn from bad experiences and move forward as opposed to stunting progress or dragging others down with them. I respect intellectuals who are in sync with the emotional side of life, they inspire me to be better actually. and just about anyone who at least makes an optimistic attempt at life. I respect organizations who have their members in mind and a good internal understanding of how things could be improved and an insight on where exactly they're going. The leader is the most important role in many things, and it will deplete my faith in the organization thoroughly and may taint my world view if s/he's merely a con. also, trial and error over rinse and repeat.

**2. What kind of things turn you off about a person, a brand/company, or a particular environment? What gets under your skin (in a bad way)?**

People who talk over others, I strongly dislike when people don't at least make an effort to understand the other person and understand they are a separate entity. Too many people are preoccupied with their own experience to the extent of extreme selfishness, and that pisses me off. I dislike when people don't follow their own advice. I hate that type of humor where a character is the butt of misfortune or mishap, and everyone finds it hilarious. I strongly dislike inauthenticity, it equates to that of 'small talk' for me. When people wait for you to stop talking, so they can start. People who repeat what they hear without internal analysis. Strongly dislike any shallow group mentality environment. egotists. passive aggressive environments. the calm before the storm.

**3. How good is your memory for detail? Specific conversations you've had in the past, little tasks that need to get done, what you were doing the first time you heard a song or tried a food, etc.**

I have a detailed memory of the past, and others are often bewildered at why I remember so much. Sometimes I will get a smell that brings me back, but bizzarely enough get it the other way round too, like if I think back to an insignificant event, I can smell/taste it. My memories even though plenty are dark, are remembered in a soft pastel overtone. I guess I remember most vividly the things with a sensory association. I'm pretty impressionable in this way. and speaking of, I could enjoy any song on the planet if there is a positive memory connected to it.

**4. What do you spend the most time thinking about - the past, the present, the future? Practical topics, logistical issues, relationships with people, theoretical concepts, issues of morality/ethics? Do you find yourself fixating on one thing, coming back to it, and trying to figure it out, or are you more prone to meandering through multiple tangentially related topics? Do you often daydream/space out? When you do daydream or fantasize, what kind of things do you imagine and think about?**

I think about all the above in equal measure, unless I'm day dreaming. I try to stay present, but am often flying through space. I'm most interested in thought provoking, complicated topics. I find speaking about people and relationships draining, as it's usually entails transference and projection, but I do keep the people I know and the relationships I have in mind at a certain level all the time. 

**5. Think about a topic or two you're really interested in and like having conversations about. Do you think you would generally have more fun talking about that topic with an enthusiastic, curious listener who asks you lots of great questions, or do you think you would generally have more fun listening to an interesting, entertaining person talk at length about it and answer your questions enthusiastically?**

Ha. Good question, I think about this a good bit, because I'm always the enthusiastic listener asking the questions. I'm regretful I can't be the former, as I have vast and colorful experiences, but I'm terrible at vocally expressing myself. terrible. I will zone out in memory of the experience and cannot find the words.

**6. In the last question, what topic(s) were you think about?**

Anything with a rabbit hole. Something with common patterns that are relatable in other topics. new perspectives on something. Somebodies personal story.

**7. If someone is doing something that you strongly disagree with, how likely are you to confront them about it? If you do confront them, how do you usually tend to do it? How does your answer change depending on your relationship with the person, and whether their actions directly affect you?**

Wow this is a broad question. Depends on a lot of things. If I respect them, like them, see eye to eye with them, feel nothing from them, am friends with them etc.. I will talk with sensitivity and understanding to those I respect. I will glare and hiss at those I don't. But I may either hiss or use sensitivity to those I like. It might actually depend on the current dynamics in the situation and not necessarily how I feel about the person overall. If their actions are malicious, I'll wreak havoc. If negligent, I'll strongly advise the do otherwise. If innocent, all is forgotten.

**8. How interested are you in trying new things - traveling, trying strange and exotic foods, going on roller coasters, jumping out of airplanes, things like that? Regardless of how interested you are, how willing would you be to do those things if someone asked you to? How often do you actually do things like that?**

A big yes to all the above, unless i'm in existential despair mode. Even if I'm not interested, but am in a good open mood, I'd be up for it, so long as whatever it is isn't cold. I love travelling, I've solo backpacked through many places on the planet.

**9. How would other people describe your demeanor? It may help to ask people you know. How emotional do you seem to people? How rational? Do you tend to be quiet and reserved, or more loud and talkative? Do you seem to choose your words carefully, or talk stream of consciousness, or do you sometimes think so fast you stumble trying to get all the words out? Do you tend to finish your sentences, or skip to the next sentence in the middle of the one you're saying, or skip to new topics entirely? Do you interrupt - if so, when and how often? How do you feel if someone interrupts you? How often do you feel like you have so much energy you can't sit still and need to be up and moving? How hard is it for you to get out of bed in the morning, or get up after relaxing for a long time?**

Most people say I'm calm, relaxed, reserved or even zen-like. I get away with revealing little but contributing a lot, thus that people believe they know me more than they do. Definitely not loud unless I hit the nerve of something i'm passionate about. Some people think I look tired or serious. I can usually feel or sense exactly how I'm being perceived though. When I choose my words carefully, I have better luck with expressing myself truthfully, but often that takes long enough that people lose their attention span, unless they're one of those magnificent creatures who help you decipher what it is you're trying to verbalize and give you time to say it. I've noticed that some people assume I'm making rhetorical/sarcastic commentary half the time when I'm actually contributing an actual thought. Haha. I actually think I need a speech therapist. I never interrupt, and i'm losing patience with those who do if to me. When I wake up, I like to get up, unless I have an undesired obligation to do....

**10. Are you involved in any creative activities or projects? What are they and why do you like them? What are your goals in these areas? What have you felt most proud of or satisfied with? How likely are you to finish a particular project you start?**

At current, I'm seeking to get back into playing field hockey, get driving license, buy a kayak, ready to dedicate myself to saxophone jazz. Come a few months time I'll study health therapy and yoga theory. I'm satisfied with my level of mandarin level I guess, I can use it for my future livelihood in interesting areas.",1514996666
isfj,"Hey guys, kinda random post but I want to know what you think of this movie!
I watched it yesterday for the second time and, oh the feels! What a beautiful movie! I was thinking that maybe as an ISFJ I found the movie more touching because we rely a lot on memories and have a strong emotion attached to them, I can't imagine having my memories about a past loved one erased, even if I regret it. 

I think that the dreamy scenes about his past memories, from childhood to all the stages of his romantic relationship, are amazing and transmit perfectly the emotions that he has associated to each memory, it gave me a feeling of nostalgia even if they were not my memories. I am rambling a bit now, so let's go with the questions: 

what's your opinion of the movie? Do you think that as ISFJs this movie can be a bit more touching for us? Would you use that technology to erase some memories of yours?

now i know everyone has their own way of coping (stages of grief, etc) but for me i hate crying. i feel like i would be a burden to other people if they see me crying. so i'd rather be their shoulder to cry on and cry by myself when i get some alone time.  or maybe distance myself from my sadness. but as it is, i can only count a few times when i've cried for myself. it's like i'm more welcoming of other people's pain than entertain my own which i think is not healthy. is this normal? although it's also occurred to me that i'm probably just depressed.

isfj,"A few years ago I asked for advice on here about an ISFJ friend of mine who grew more and more toxic and keep pushing me away. I met up with her yesterday and it was great. She had changed drastically and apologized for how she had pushed me away and for her toxic behavior. 

She is trying to be more open and forgiving to others and to not let a judgmental mindset dictate her day to day life. and she wishes to reconnect and be friends again. I was worried about her for so long and can finally feel relief that she was able to pull herself out of her downward spiral and that she found a path to be happy and accepting of herself and others.

I am so unbelievably happy about this and just wanted to share this with someone without it being like gossiping to other people in my life.

Over the course of our conversations, she told me how she hates the idea of saying we met on a dating app to be the story of how we met, being a hopeless romantic. I've suggested that this hurdle can be surmounted by making the first meeting in person the substitute for the ""how we met"" story, and she concurred, though she added that it would have to be pretty memorable. So basically what I'm asking is, what would be the best ways to make a good impression on an ISFJ on the first date/get together? And on a more general scale, what does are the things that an ISFJ would most appreciate in a relationship?

In the past when she felt down I tried to help her in my own way by rationalizing her problems but I realized it doesnt make her feel i sympathize with her. In my experience with her when she has problems she doesn‚Äôt take advices/suggestions/other opinions very well and she only gets mad and feel misunderstood. So what I started doing is consider what she feels about things before anything. But I dont really know what to say and how to comfort her. i just listen and see her get up on her own.

Is it common to believe that you're not liked? Do you think it has more to do with her depression than her type?

I did stuff which I probably haven't forgiven myself for and thus think I am a terrible person despite people saying I am a good person who just made bad decisions. I know I'm a good person, but I can't help but feel I'm a bad person. 

The last couple of years I have been getting over that and working to put myself in a good spot, and I have, but there's a problem. I'm still alone.

Over the years I have had some good friends and we have drifted apart due to location and other things. One thing that has always remained is I am so caring and nice to people. I always want to help people out as much as I can. I am a good listener and want to be here for close friends that they can depend on me for support and advice without judgement or fear. I mostly put people's needs above my own and willing to help anyone. I I hurt someone that wronged me then depending on what it was, I may or may not feel bad about those actions. 

I am a confidence person. If I gain confidence I am such a good person to be around. But when I have no confidence I am a mess.

I am in a great job and I am a hard worker. I am a desktop publisher. My previous job I was basically the face of the company. Clients would always come to me instead of my bosses and I would help them out. I would put in so much effort that I never asked for anything or appreciation but I was never appreciated and wanted to be deep down. 

Past relationships with girls haven't been good. The types of girls that have been attracted to me used me deeply. I have been cheated on and used and the mother of a previous girlfriend kept telling her that I am not worth it and she can do better than me. So my confidence levels when it has come to that side of things has been shot. Problem is some times I think she was/is right. I will get to that later. 

As I have struggled to maintain friendships I am alone and feel like shit when people don't talk to me. So therefore I come across as so needy. I try to reach out to friends but when they don't respond or want to catch up I feel like I am not special. Therefore I need massive assurance and if I don't get it I struggle. 

I am making a lot of good changes in my life but the same thing remains. I am lonely. I am so fucking used to being lonely that I start to think I am going to be this way forever. 

I had a major high speed car accident when I was 20 and I walked away unscathed so I know I am here for a reason so that's why I always fight and never give up. I'm so resilient. 

I am told I am awesome and such a good guy and that people would be lucky to have me as a friend or boyfriend yet here I am alone and can't hold friendships so I wonder to myself are they just saying that to make me feel better? If it were true then why don't I have people in my life that want to hang with me or understand me. It's because they don't understand me. 

That's where this ENTP friend comes into play. She understands me and wants me to vent if it helps me but I don't want our friendship to become just that. I haven't met anyone that understands me so it's good talking to her but here is a problem. I can't help but feel it's going to be a matter of time until she grows cold of me and ditches me like everyone else has and that's the problem I have when it comes to new friendships. I am a massive overthinker and dwell on the past. I mean her no disrespect and even though I know she understands me I can't help but feel that way you know? She thinks I am great but I can't help but feel she is going to run 100 miles away. I feel a bond with her that I want to keep but am scared. 

That is where confidence comes in. If I can have a good friend and them not abandon me then I will get confidence back that I can have friendships. Likewise a relationship with someone. Despite past shit I am willing to put myself out there again but most girls would get turned off with me. If I was in a relationship with someone and it didn't work out and ended on good terms I would have confidence for the future. 

Anyway I can't keep relying on this friend because even though she has helped me a lot I want our friendship to be based on more. I want it to be genuine and we can talk about lots of different stuff, which we have shown we can do as we have a lot in common, but lately it's just been me venting. 

That is why I'm opening myself up here to see if anyone can relate to this and what they did to get over these heightened feelings I have.

No one has spoken to me in well over 24 hours apart from work colleagues and I am here feeling so crap. I have tried to talk to people but they haven't shown interest. All I need is someone to check in and see how I'm going etc. I don't need a conversation. I just need to be shown appreciation and love every now and then but no one can really provide it. I know they are busy or need time to themselves particularly the latter with this ENTP friend and I told her she can talk to me whenever she wants so I understand that, but I cant help but be fearful maybe she has gone cold when she doesn't and doesn't like me anymore. Basically I am so used to being lonely I can go days without talking to anyone and I feel like I'm going to be lonely the rest of my life. I need to be able to get rid of these feelings of self doubt so I can improve friendships. I need to improve friendships. I'm always looking to improve myself where I can. 

Don't get me wrong. I am happy with half of my life. I am just way too much of an overthinker.

Sorry for the long post. Just wanted to share my story and see if anyone out there feels the same. We can all benefit from each other. ",1511821193

I am fairly new to the realisation that I am an ISFJ, and in no way want to ""blame"" or attribute some of my quality to my type, and obviously we are all individuals. 

But after reading more about ISFJ qualities, I massively connected with the trait of being very practical, traditional, and concerned with ""here and now"". I don't spend much time daydreaming or imagining  new things or characters, but as someone who really enjoys drawing, music, and all things creative, want to expand my abilities in that area.

How do you find creativity works as an ISFJ? Anyone out there also struggling with being a bit too practical and struggling to break away from convention? How do you set your imagination free?

i would say this is probably because i'm usually zoned out and in my own head all the time, which makes me worry that i'm never really enjoying life in the present. i also feel like me being zoned out makes me seem like a rude/disinterested person when i'm the complete opposite. i literally remember everything people tell me, i just don't look engaged during the process.

2. Instrument(s)?
3. How long have you been playing?
4. Play in any bands?
5. Do you write original music?
6. How does mbti fit into your music?

I‚Äôll start!

1. I like folk rock, rock, punk, bluegrass (not so much traditional), pop punk, folk, jazz fusion, funk, and blues based rock.  I‚Äôm not a fan of pop or country (I mainly just don‚Äôt like modern country, but I like Americana).  A few favorite bands include The Beatles, Ben Folds, Los Lonely Boys, Red Hot Chili Peppers, allman brothers, the band, Derek trucks, bob Dylan, Blake mills, blue rodeo, the bros. Landreth, Chatham county line, Dawes, Dave Rawlings, Elvis Costello, Elliot smith, fall out boy (their old stuff), Bayside, Four year strong, the hush sound, Jason isbell, I fight dragons, motion city soundtrack, the Jayhawks, nickel creek, Relient K, ry cooder, Ryan Adams, the shins, slaid cleaves, son volt, the wallflowers, and Wilco.

2. I mainly play the guitar. I can play the piano, drums, piano, and mandolin as well, but guitar is my best instrument

3. Been playing guitar since I was 12 (I‚Äôm 20 now). 
Other instruments I started later - all of them I started probably between the ages of 13 and 15. 

4. I play in a cover band with a few friends - we play mainly more popular stuff just to make some extra money.  
I also play guitar for a family band. We write originals, but my brother and cousin have written all the songs that we play.

5. I do like to write music. I‚Äôve written probably 12 songs that I‚Äôve never showed to anyone. I‚Äôm mainly trying to improve my songwriting abilities. I‚Äôm trying to get better at writing lyrics mainly. I‚Äôll eventually show some songs to my band so we can play them, but I‚Äôm waiting until my songs are good enough .

6. As an isfj, performances make me nervous. But after doing it for a while, I definitely don‚Äôt get as nervous as I used to. Could be my introverted sensing - as I perform more and more I get more and more used to being on stage and don‚Äôt get as phased by it.  Writing lyrics is hard for me, which could go back to the fact that Ne is inferior - ideas don‚Äôt come to me very easily or often and I‚Äôm not good with metaphors or other literary devices.  I do think, however, that Fe improves my ability to write good music - it allows me to experience the melody and harmony emotionally and write pieces that have the power to move others.  ",1511639796

isfj,"Well, long story short I had an isfj coworker, at least I'm pretty sure he was an isfj. Admittedly we didn't work together very long but when we did we bonded extremely well before he was transferred.We had all of the same interests and would talk for hours sometimes. Also, he was constantly joking around with me, going out of his way to approach and mess with me, literally every possible opportunity. Well, a problem happened at my work after he left and I texted him for the first time asking for his opinion on the issue. His response was very brief and curt so I assumed that I had crossed over a line since we didn't work together long and didn't text him again. 

 Well, he came back to my workplace to get his last paycheck and went looking for me to talk. When he tracked me down, he was super friendly, asking me if everything was ok, and encouraging me to text if any other issues came up, saying he wanted to know and that I wasn't going to bother him. After he left the building he also sent a text reassuring that I wasn't bother him and to let him know if any other issues came up. So weeks later I texted, updating him on the situation which had gotten worse and asked him how his new job was going. He basically only responded to how his job was going in one short curt sentence and didn't respond to my situation at all. That was about two months ago. Idk.. I know he didn't have any obligation to respond to me at all but it seems weird because he was encouraging me to keep contacting him then his responses almost seem like he's annoyed when I do.

isfj,"Hey there!

I'm concerned about my ISFJ friend. And could use some insight if anyone is up for it. 

A little back info. I'm and INFP and my husband is an INTP. And we both fit mostly what you would expect for our types. We are usually late, run out of clean cloths because we were too busy driving 3 hrs to go watch a meteor shower, loose things often etc. That said we needed some help with repetitive and administrative work and hired my husband's ISFJ cousin. We care about her a lot and have had many long deep conversations. Mostly about dreams and life, and to remind her not to focus on what everyone else wants her life to be but to choose her own path. But now she is going through something else. Something that me being a different type I can recognize, but I can't grasp what would be helpful for an ISFJ during this process. Basically she is feeling let down by her peers. She has expectations of how she wants to be treated (but never voices them). So her ditzy teenage friends ""aren't listening and making inresponsible choices"" and resenting her for her supiorior attitude. And everyone ""walk over"" her and ""dont have empathy"" and ""they all do this"" and ""everyone is so selfish"". Those are feelings I can relate to, but I also know well that dwelling on those hurt feelings and disappointment is isolating. And as much as us introverts love our isolated island... it's not a good idea to expect that every visitor to our island will just let us down ""like everyone else has"". She had such a doe eyed outlook on the world and I'm starting to see that change... I guess I'm just wondering what I can do or say to help keep her from getting bitter. 

Have you felt similarly to her? What can I do/say to help keep her from snapping shut her soul from the world?

isfj,"Hi lovely ISFJs, 

After a lot of time observing and interacting with my workplace crush, I've realized she is not an INFJ as I had originally thought, but rather a very thoughtful and warm-hearted ISFJ. Therefore I have two big questions I'd like any help with.
1) I've heard plenty about ENTP-INFJ magic compatibility, however ENTP-ISFJ is not talked about as much. I personally believe that there is a lot of room for each side of this pairing to benefit, given the huge differences in personality, but I can also see the struggles. What do ISFJs think of ENTPs? 
2) I'd love to know if any of these behaviors I've noticed about how she interacts with me are telling of a possible crush on her end as well: 

-will laugh very loudly at almost every joke I make, especially if we are alone, but even when we are in groups
-seemingly treats me differently in solo interactions (more attentive, open when I ask questions, willing to engage with my silliness) than group conversations (checking her phone, giving brief unrevealing answers, trying to play it more cool towards me)  
-Almost always eats lunch with me. If more people are in the lunch group, she will often stick it out until others leave and stay and keep talking to me for another 10-15 minutes. 
-She always joins to go out to a restaurant or bar after work with me and other coworkers. But as far as I can tell, she never elects to drink at these outings even if she does drink with other friends (afraid of showing feelings?) 
-beginning to tell me more private things out of the blue that she doesn't tell other members of our work friend group. This is still very rare, but it does happen (talking about things she doesn't like about her job, or gripes about co-workers/friends outside of work) 
-She very rarely initiates conversations in person and though she responds if I IM her, she doesn't typically engage in drawn out conversations with me that way  
-There aren't a lot of other young males in the office and of the other young males, but I am the only one I have ever seen her engage with socially, in a non professional manner 

I have other examples I could give if needed. I'm still trying to figure her out and am willing to wait until she is more comfortable with me, if needed, as she really is one of the most caring, conscientious and quietly clever people I've ever met and I think that's exactly all an ENTP guy could ask for.

I recently started sixth form college, and most of my old friends are gone. I have one friend left, who I feel I am losing my connection with. I don‚Äôt know why, but I struggle to find a new friend group that I would fit into, and if I could, I couldn‚Äôt figure out how to join. Currently, I just block people out.

I have always had a hard time connecting deeply with others. I always just thought it was me until I recently did the personality test and found this community. I'm blown away by how similarly I feel.
Basically, I'm very nice and friendly with everyone and will go out of my way to make sure everyone around me is comfortable, while I feel out of place myself. But you would never know it by seeing me. 
I find it practically impossible to open up to others and have been feeling increasingly more lonely as what I need is a deep bond to feel connected. I will always help and take care of others as much as I can but don't feel comfortable enough to be open with others with how I am. All my friendships are basically just ""surface"", very rarely have I felt close enough with someone to consider them a true friend, and that doesn't always last, I put in the effort but need to feel it reciprocated. 
I feel alone in large groups and can get easily overrun by others, mostly I stay silent unless I'm spoken to. In smaller groups, it's easier but I still have a very hard time being comfortable.

I recently found out something about two of my friends which made it clear we could no longer be friends. Pretty hurtful.

I cry about particularly emotional commercials, and I haven't shed a tear. 


However, the time when I amicably broke up with someone I was doubled up on the ground with a stomach ache induced by anxiety and guilt.

Even if I was doing the right thing by nipping it in the bud, I felt so awful for the (probably minor, intj) disappointment they felt.

Our main form of communicating is texting, and we only vocally communicate when playing PC or xbox live games ) 

Basically I feel like he HATES me. He hates me for all my strengths, like my passion for things that catch my attention ( mostly books, video games, art) and i want to spend a lot of my time focusing on those things. Unfortunately most of the things i really LOVE are things he hates due to my insane passion for them ( he's told me that I make things too overwhelming and scare him away ) but im just a really REALLY excitable person. 

What happened today was that my sister asked me to go with her to her work appreciation dinner, and i went last year, so I agreed. Well my boyfriend and i had plans to play a specific video game tomorrow and I told him today around 5pm that I'm going with her to the dinner tomorrow, and he sent me 5 paragraphs saying that he planned to play with me from sunrise to sunset on Monday and that he's extremely upset I made plans. Mind you I will probably only be at this dinner for a few hours and will mostly spend the rest of my waking hours with him. The bottom line of this is, this kind of thing is what we constantly argue about. What i choose to dedicate my time to. I see playing video games with him as playing video games, not spending time with him, and when i refuse to play a game and make other plans, I am doing it because I find whatever else im doing more worth my time than playing the game, not because of my feelings about him. He always assumes its the other way around. 

My max time before i start getting restless constantly doing one thing is about 6 hours and he gets angry when i don't consistently play ONE specific game for more than that with no breaks. I cannot possibly focus on one thing that long, I need to get out of the house, talk to people, do chores or i start getting tired and unhappy. He absolutely hates this about me. He complains I always put the things I am passionate about first ( which i do ) but he doesn't understand how that different for me. I cannot possibly change myself and I wouldn't want to, I'm relatively happy juggling 400 ideas and tasks at once rather than focusing on one thing for 10-12 hours nonstop.

I'm so perceptive of other people's comfort levels but nobody can ever tell what I'm thinking and suddenly I've met these people where if they caught on to how similar we were they'd know exactly what was going through my mind and that's kind of unsettling. 

On a slightly unrelated note, I also know I would work terribly with someone of the same personality type to me if I were in a relationship. I bounce off of people's outward personalities, and quirky qualities that are different to my own. I've only realised that since meeting people of the same type to me, not sure if anyone else has had that experience?",1509974618
isfj,"I've been planning a story for a couple of years and there is this character who for fun I tested for his MBTI recently. He has come out as isfj. From descriptions he does seem like he is like you guys, although he does want to change a lot of things in his life, and society in general. That's kind of his whole character, but the reason for doing so is because in all his past experiences in life he feels the system he is living in is wrong. (The reason I want to know is because it'll give me a more complete sense of who he is, although I won't change him to fit a certain type. That'll take the fun out of it. I'm an INFP btw) 

Really briefly explaining him, he is wronged by a lot of high ranking people as a child because of the system of his society. He also has a medical issue. When he is older he feels that he can't fix the things that are wrong with him and society until he is told to fix his medical condition he has to change the society he is living in. And therefore thinks he can kill two birds with one stone. Now he meets more people and sticks to a plan that was forged with help from other people to fix society. He is personally and emotionally tested to follow through with his plan but he does so by the end. However he is always struggling with either sticking to his plan and staying away from his family. One side he doesn't want his family to be hurt like they have been in the past and on the other he wants to stay close to his family because of his immense love and need for them emotionally.

This is the basic character and his decisions and reasons. Do you guys relate to this and is there anything striking that makes him completely non isfj? Main thing that confused me is how you guys seem to be traditionalist which I don't think fit my character in the common term.",1509955829
isfj,"Before I go to far I firstly want to apologise for any spelling mistakes and grammar mistakes. I'm dyslexic lol (true) 
I'm an ESFJ and my sister in-law is an ISFJ. I care about her and just want to get along, but alas I have upset her and would like to patch things up as it's gotten out of hand.
Last weekend I had my daughter's birthday party at which we had an issue. It was time to do the Birthday song and cutting of the cake. I had spent over a week putting it together and the topper on the cake had already fallen and broke in which my husband patched up and fixed it to his best ability.
We had a plastic table cloth on the table a the little ones ranging from ages 1-4 were pulling at in and everything including the cake was sliding everywhere. So my sister in-law piped up and said why don't we just take the table cloth off. Which I happily agreed should be done and was grateful she wanted to help. At the stage she was crouched down holding her son, I was now standing hands full with an unstable Birthday cake in my hands. She from her crouched position couldn't see a thing past me and began to pull the table cloth off. On the other side of me was all my daughters gifts big boxes etc. They were all coming in my direction. I was trapped between boxes of stuff coming my way, a cake in my hands and my sister in-law crouched down holding her kid in one hand and grabbing at the table cloth in the other. I was trapped and couldn't do a thing. In a panic I asked her to stop. She kept pulling so I raised my voice in urgency to stop again which she did. Everything got fixed up boxes taken off and went on with the Birthday song and cutting of the cake. I thought nothing much of it until my husband had talked to his brother and he said she wasn't happy with how she was treated. So now what do I do as this weekend my nephew had his birthday party this weekend and we didn't get invited and got to see all the photos up on fb. For me I'm just upset my child got excluded from her cousin birthday over this. I'm sure this couldn't have just been the only thing I've upset her with, but I've never gone out of my way to upset anyone on purpose let alone her. I don't want to make things worse I just want to make things better mostly for the kids sake. Please any advice would be nice. Thanks in advance. ",1509887225

Note: I'm only 16 and male so that probably doesn't help the case.

But thinking about it more, I'm not so sure if I am. I'm not very organized at all, and tend to lose things fairly often. I enjoy interacting with new people all the time, even though I'm not very good at it. Also, when I think about it, I hate being completely alone, and I definitely don't fit the description of an introvert where you would need to ""recharge"" after interaction. Many of my friends describe me as more extroverted as well so IDK. I tend to talk about myself alot, so I have to remind myself to include others in conversation as well. I have no clue about how I feel about conflict tho, i seem to cause alot of it :/. I'm kind of impatient as well when to comes to more selfish things, but if I'm helping others I can wait forever. 

Despite all of this, I can definitely relate to alot of the top posts on this subreddit and can see the sides of me that are ISFJ. I do feel left out sometimes among a group of friends, where I feel as if I just don't fit in. I definitely feel more comfortable with friends than I am at home with family. Positive reinforcement is super important to me, and I can get pretty down if I don't get any for a while. Lastly, I tend to feel like I'm always bothering people, so I tend to use ""sorry to bother you but..."" and if they're doing something ""oh, sorry I won't bother you then."" Oh yea, and I'm the biggest procrastinator ever(definitely not procrastinating math homework rn).

Anyways I care about her very much and I know she cares about me but I struggle in showing it at times.

One example would be among a group of friends, feeling a disconnect although there is no external evidence to support this (still being included, still participating, but feeling somewhat or very disconnected).

Another example would be in a classroom, naturally ending up alone, or being/working with friends/acquaintences but still feeling like you're the odd one out but not being able to explicitly identify why (nothing obvious sets you apart).

Even in a one on one situation feeling somewhat disconnected and unable to properly express yourself, your thoughts, reactions etc to the other person to the extent that you feel your actions and contributions are mechanical and robotic (despite caring about the person  and experiencing genuine emotions inside).",1507219349

Last night, as I began to tell him, I said ""before I tell you what happened.."" I was beginning to tell him how something that happened yesterday directly correlated with last week's events. 

Well, he completely interrupts, says ""I don't want to hear about anything else. Just tell me about last week's situation."" I really did think that what I had to say was interesting enough that he'd want to hear. I started again ""But no, this goes with last...."" I get cut off again, getting talked over so I couldn't say anything at all. At this point, I instinctively just said quietly, ""I will not say anything then"" and completely shut down. 

He tried to joke a bit after that but I gave yes or no responses. While he did stay over, we didn't speak much at all after that. This morning, as we both left, we didn't really say anything and just went about our way.

Usually, we just joke about differences/things like this but not this time. He's an ESTJ so he's a VERY strong personality, but over time I've gotten used to that. We both are playful so it's always been okay. This time, though, things were different. 

Am I being too sensitive? I'm not even sure what I'm feeling right now. Sad? Hurt? Annoyed? Should I reach out to him? Should I wait? How would you feel as an ISFJ?

tldr;
Met isfj girl- confessed- tells me she wants to know me at current level- since then we've been talking everyday and having long phone calls.

- What are signs an ISFJ girls like you?
- How can you differentiate platonic to romantic vibes?
***
It started out with us following each other on Instagram through mutual friends and she would always like my stuff. Gradually she would comment on my pictures and stories too which kind of got my attention because I never really thought about her often.

I then posted an IG story asking if anyone in her city would want to hang out (we live in different cities) and she was one of the first to respond, I have to add though that we never met before in person so this got me even more intrigued. (Also have to add she has social anxiety?)

Fast forward a couple of weeks I asked if she had a boyfriend, found out she recently broke up. Fast forward again a few more weeks, I tell her I want to get to know her more than a friend and I don't expect anything to happen right now. She tells me she's been dating guys after guys since she was young and wants to experience being alone and wants to know me at the ""current level"", she did add that she didn't want this to be a BS excuse because she said she does like talking to me and that I'm a cool and interesting person so I guess she does like me as a person? Which is totally ok.

Fast forward to the present. We've been talking everyday, maybe missing a few days in the past month or two? I've held my feelings back from falling for her because I can still turn it into platonic vibes.

What I want to know is, if I am (or seems as if I am) friendzoned why does she talk to me so often and doesn't mind hour long phone calls? I've been wanting to just sit her down (my friends I've confided in have voiced that it's a bad idea and I should just ghost her but she said says too many guys have ghosted her when they didn't get what they wanted from her, which is not me) and tell her that I do like her just to make it clear and that I'd probably want to not message her for a bit so I can get my feelings into platonic mode because I would want to be able to treat her as a friend and not stress her out with my infatuation of her. She's really someone who I would've regretted not knowing whether romantically or platonically in my life. Somehow, before I make the transition into seeing her completely platonically I just want to know if there is no other way? 

Also she has been opening up to me since she says she's not good with being vulnerable or emotional? Which is very sweet and motivating for me :)

Anyways enough of that intro..

I've been single for a long time and i thought maybe i should put myself out there again so i installed a dating app for the first time. Had a few matches but eventually the conversations fizzled out (yep i got ghosted a lot of times) until one day this INTJ guy (it's included in his username, also the reason why i thought of this sub) messaged me and immediately asked for my number. I gave my number thinking it's more convenient and i guess i thought he really wanted to know me.

So we started texting each other, the usual getting-to-know-you stuff, random topics, and even had long phone conversations. But then one day i was extremely busy at work and i wasn't able to reply to his text (the topic was at a dead end and didn't know how to continue). And he didn't call so i thought he was busy. The following day he texted that i was too busy and was ghosting him. I was surprised by this and replied that i wasn't ghosting him, that sometimes i really don't reply immediately even with friends (true story), and maybe we should start again? He agreed but it was never the same. He would only have one-word replies to my texts and even told me that he doesn't text first if he thought the other person doesn't have time for him. It got to the point that i was running out of things to say, it felt like talking to a wall. And then it turned worse when he finally called again but i missed it. I returned the call but he didn't answer. Apparently he got pissed at me and texted me that i should just text him back when i have the time, that i shouldn't have stopped ghosting him and not apologised but didn't make up for it because i was being insincere. So i acknowledged that my commitment issues were questionable and i didn't make up for it enough. And he replied that knowing it isn't enough is one thing, making up for it is another. I didn't know what to reply on that one so that was the end of the story.

**TL;DR**: Socially awkward ISFJ installs a dating app and meets INTJ guy. We exchange numbers, had several conversations until one time i didn't know how to continue the conversation. Guy thought i ghosted him, tried to talk with him again but apparently it wasn't enough.

So my question is, how do you deal with someone who come on too strong? I'm not sure if it's just me or my personality but most of the time i really clam up around people who are kind of intimidating. I really struggle with human interaction (i think i mentioned this to him and he just laughed at me jerk).

Also is it also difficult for you to converse with others? Personally i like listening better unless a topic is really interesting to me but most of the time i still end up listening. How do you practice your conversation skills?

Finally, do you ask the other person their personality type when you date? Which personality types do you get along with in your experience?

Sorry about this mess. In hindsight i should've probably ghosted him for real and spared myself from trouble.

* Si and Se deal with real experiences directly.
* Ni and Ne deal with patterns and connections.
* Si and Ni are concerned with worldview.
* Se and Ne are concerned with possibilities.

Ni/Se and Si/Ne work together as pairs:

* Ni/Se operate within one context at a time. Se usually focuses on the present context, but Ni can mentally shift the context in space/time so Se can have a look at it.
* Si/Ne are cross-contextual. So Si builds up insights over time, and Ne uses it as a springboard to find parallels between situations, objects, ideas, anything.

Therefore:

* Ni builds its worldview by looking at patterns and connections within a single context at a time.
* Si builds its worldview by looking at real experiences across contexts.
* Se finds possibilities by looking at real experiences in the current context.
* Ne finds possibilities by looking at patterns and connections across contexts.

So I'm an INFP guy who is currently completely smitten with an ISFJ girl whom I've known now for about a month and a half. 
It took all my courage to ask her out on a date which she agreed to! The date went well I think, and I did my best to make her feel comfortable.
However, near the end of the date she revealed that her previous relationship ended badly so she doesn't want to rush into a relationship, since we have just met and she barely knows me.

Among our common group of ""friends/acquaintances"" we are both relatively new, so neither of us know the rest of the group too well. She says she wants to get to know everyone better, including me. 

As an INFP, I strongly lean with my intuition and gut, and tend to fall for people fast and hard. I feel so comfortable and at ease around her.

After reading about ISFJ's it seems like she is being cautious since she doesn't know me well enough yet.
I don't want to rush her, and I hope that over time I can show her that I'm trustworthy. But I guess my question to you guys is: 

Should I maintain my feelings for her and continue with the hope that once she gets to know me more and trusts me, that she will start to like me? Or do you think
she's already made her decision and was just being polite?  

She did text me the day after the date saying that she appreciated me being straightforward with my feelings, and me not being awkward about it helped her be more honest, and that she hopes to get to know me better over time.",1505161860

Hello,

Can you give examples of situations in everyday activities when the combination S√≠ - Fe is very useful and examples when it can create issues?

I'm thinking of common situations like driving to work, buying lunch, doing house chores etc

isfj,"As an ISFJ, does anyone else struggle to meet time limits on tests at school? Not for lack of trying, or being distracted, but simply that there is not enough time to answer all the problems and answer them well/at least comfortably.

(/r/iamverysmart) I always get told I'm smart, and I do have straight A's, but I chalk it up to being driven to prepare myself for anything that I might encounter on a piece of paper--no more, no less. This opinion of mine is also reinforced by things such as the fact that I scored fairly low on the ACT (&lt;24), meanwhile others can breeze through tests such as these and achieve a perfect score, or at least a more rewarding one. 

I was wondering what causes people to function higher on the ACT, if anyone else--particularly fellow ISFJ's--endure a similar plight against timed testing in general, and what other comments, experiences, questions, etc. you guys might have regarding anything in this discussion.

Thanks :)",1505130765
isfj,"I keep reading about ISFJ's being boring homebodies that like routine. I'm an ISFJ but in many aspects I can't relate. Yes at times I'm really good at getting shit done around my moderately clean apartment and sometimes I procrastinate or I'm to busy to finish chores (like folding laundry). But I am very social. Most people mistype me, including my family, thinking I'm extroverted. I need socialization and will seek it out. If I need to socialize but my friends are working or busy with family stuff I'll go to bars alone, music festivals alone, traveled internationally solo. I'm not great at getting groups of people motivated to do something with me but I do occasionally. And if I want to try something new or go somewhere I will go alone if I can't get anyone to come. And sometimes I'd rather go alone cause I don't want to go with someone who doesn't enjoy the activity or will complain if they don't like trying something new.
I have a lot of hobbies and interests. I've had a hard time in LA cause people my age just want to go to the bars all the time and I want to go backpacking, or to museums, or scuba diving or talk about books, media, business, stocks, etc. In fact, socially I feel more isolated cause I feel like I have to have multiple groups of friends for my different interests and I wish I could just have a ""go to"" group of friends for all the different things I enjoy. For example I have a ton of friends that will meet me at the bars, a small group that I go backpacking/ hiking with, a few people I scuba dive with, and ONE friend that I can meet at a quiet bar and have business/ stock/ media/ philosophical discussion with (He's an INFJ if your wondering) &lt;wish there was more. 
Some of this social problem is the city I live in. Or at least thats what I gather from some of my close friends I share this with.

I recently took the myers briggs test and found that Im an ISFJ, and it seems to fit me well. Ive looked on different websites for careers suited for isfjs, but was wondering if anyone here could give me advice on my situation.

I graduated from college within the past year with a general public health degree. I currently work as a health educator for a hospital, and am looking for a new position better suited for my personality. I chose this line of work because learning about health care had always interested me, and I wasn't sure which direction I wanted to go in. I like being able to help patients, but Im too much of an introvert for this position, and dont like the constant overlap with social work. I have full health benefits through my work, and cant really afford to leave my job to go back to school. Im looking for something I can go back to school for part time, or even earn a certification, so I can enter a different field. I like working in health care and want to use my bachelors degree, but I dont enjoy working with patients and definitely need my alone time during the day. Any fellow isfjs have any suggestions or insights? Anything would be appreciated. ",1504901371
isfj,"What are your thoughts on the Enfj? Are there any you're close to? Do you get along with the ones in your life? 
I've noticed that it's hard for me to communicate and understand Enfjs clearly.  My interactions with them are awkward a lot of them, just because I don't think we understand each other that well. The ones I know can be highly illogical a lot of the time, which I find it hard to move past without getting annoyed. They're also Idea driven people and I find that they can be very controlling and bossy, which drives me crazy. I've noticed they exaggerate a lot of the time as well, which sometimes even arrives at the point of them telling me blatant lies. 
So what are your experiences with the Enfj? Do you have better experiences with them than I do?",1504791265
isfj,"Hi fellow ISFJs,

Before discovering Myers Briggs, I always sort of contemplated why I could bond quite easily with some people while others it was more difficult/forced. I blamed myself thinking I just had lousy social skills, but after finding out my personality type and the types of my closest friends, I made a connection.

The people I instantly bonded with are INFJ (3 of them) and INFP (2). These same people are ones I remain close to and conversation comes quite naturally and it's easy to open up.
However, I know 2 ESFPs and even though I bonded with them, I find I put up a wall around how I truly feel.

I was wondering if any of you have shared similar experiences as I have in regards to who you bond with? What personality types do you feel you make an instant connection to? I'd love to hear your input!",1504710729
isfj,"These are the major aspects of my personality that differentiate me from other personality types. I suspect strongly that these things are probably true of most ISTJs? Let me know if you relate...

- Without some frame of reference, I am lost. I accept, to some degree, that the first time I do something, I might do it horribly wrong. But once I do it a few times, I get much more comfortable, and the best work I do is with anything I've had exposure to. So math has been a good subject for me: teach a bit, then do a hundred math problems to get it down. If it was ""read this book and write an essay on your own thoughts"", I'd be lost.

- Change is just always hard. And it's good for people, sure, but wow, it is incredibly hard for me. I recently got an eye floater and I feel like my world is ending, even though I read that 50% of people over age 70 have them, and they seem fine with it. (Granted, I am only 32) Having to adapt to any new health issue is always devastating at the beginning. And honestly I still can't get over my memories of pre-health problems and pine for those times.

- Having Fe as my lead feeling function, I end up just not getting Fi. I have never understood how someone can see an event happen and immediately have a very specific reaction to it / opinion of it. Like say the government passes a new bill, and some folks immediately start protesting. Maybe there are some good parts to it? There's always a lot of grey...

- Another key thing about Fe is that if I say something that grinds someone's gears in any way, I immediately back down, even if I feel like I might be right. I remember devastating losses in political debates between a liberal and then later a conservative in the same week! Shouldn't I have agreed with one of them? lol....

- Our superpower, IMO, is knowing how to help others. Fe being our dominant extroverted function drives us to do this, and Si helps us figure out what works best. I admit I used to be awful at helping others at first since I had no clue how to. Now that I know techniques, I want to make a life of it. I want it so much that I've gone back to school to become a nurse. Which so far has been good, but I'm really struggling with mental and this one physical problem with my eye which I didn't have to worry about in my first college go-round. It's tough to venture out into the new.

- And a few more things with that...I'm still single, and I have really beaten myself up for that. You don't need to offer any words of advice...I've heard em all, and my Si helps me remember it too, lol. It just kills me to be in a family where my brothers got married straight out of college and had normal lives, and I've been the one that had to try and convince myself to be happy with different, nontraditional circumstances. Hopefully you fellow ISFJs realize how tall of an order that is.

Anyway. That's all for now....",1504710560
isfj,"""The ISFJ poorly tolerates monotony. He/she needs alternatives to boring everyday life, a possibility to make a choice, even though finding himself always in it. Greatly enjoys himself if he finds a way out of dead-end, seemingly hopeless situations. Interested in unusual and extraordinary people who have many ideas and make bold proposals. Boring, mundane people strain him; he tries to avoid their company. He is tolerant of eccentrics and inventors, all those people who are ""not of this world"". He views them like children, looks after them graciously forgiving their antics.

The ISFJ receives and understands chaotic information poorly. It makes him confused, throws him off track, may even spoil his mood. The ISFJ likes it when someone makes a connections between specific events and general concepts. His self-esteem improves from becoming aware of his own usefulness, that without him it won't do. Likes to correspond to the place or role allotted to him. Activates when he is given a clear goal and explained the trajectory of action. Ways of achieving it he will find himself. Doesn't need ""bare"" facts, instructions, explanations. The main thing for him is to like the system, that it would evoke a positive response in him. Then he becomes collected and organized.""",1504647745

I've had trouble sleeping. 
When I first go to bed I will fall asleep for about 30-45 min but then I begin to dream (think?) about all the things I ever did or ever could do that we're wrong, awkward, or made people feel bad, etc. Sometimes the feelings are abstract, like just the feeling in your chest when you screwed up and you know it.
The feeling jolts me out of a sleep and I can't fall back asleep for hours. Once I do fall back asleep, it's the same pattern.
After about 3 cycles, the night it over and I have to go to work.

I am very withdrawn. I am married, have been with husband for 12 years, married for two. I am very passionate and romantic person and work very hard on my relationship. Husband is equally introverted but we are just as in love as we were then and its beautiful.

 I have had very few friends in life. I have trouble trusting people though and have been used in the past.  I rarely show my emotions. Inside I am constantly battling self doubt. People say I am very kind.  I dont have it in me to be mean even when wronged. I get hurt very easily but don't let it show. I come off as cold and emotionless and I believe I have social anxiety. Despite this I am happy with my life. I am hardworking and ambitious but deep down I feel really stupid. I suck at conversations and people have described me as a robot cos I am not quick witted and struggle to find the words to say. Part of this is that my mind is always racing and I cant seem to slow it down. 

Does anyone else have similar experiences? I think my inability to handle social situatuons has hindered me from getting jobs I want and things like that.

For example, I am frequently his confidant- he trusts me with some pretty heavy stuff that he hasn't told anyone else and always kind of seems shocked at himself for telling me. I don't know whether to take this as a good sign or not, partly because I do have a knack for getting people to open up. He takes things I say very seriously, for example, there was one time where in a moment of vulnerability told him that his teasing of me (which he tells me he just gets the urge to do with me) was getting to be too much and asked him if it was him being passive aggressive about something he wasn't confronting me about, an accusation that he took kind of hard, I think, because he very abruptly stopped teasing me, and will still occasionally bring that conversation up (it was about 1.5 years ago) and quote me on things I said during it (and generally remembers things I say long after I've said them), and tells me how guilty he felt after I told him my feelings were hurt. He even jokingly inquired once if it was because 'I was in love with him' that I took his teasing to heart. He will initiate things with me, but only when I bump into him - usually when we hang out it is a spontaneous suggestion on his part, whenever he sees me, but has only ever planned something with me once (concert), as opposed to me actually planning to spend time with him. He compliments my appearance every so often but we are friends so that isn't really crazy. Oh, and he did once randomly show me a picture of himself shirtless, with no prompting on my end, because he was showing me a different picture on his phone and scrolled passed it, but then for some reason felt he had something to prove and made a big show of showing me the pic.

isfj,"I can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm a Si-Fe or Fi-Se user. I always get ISFJ or ISFP as the majority answer depending on the questionnaire I fill out. When taking cognitive function tests, I usually get Si, Fi, Fe, Se in that order. The only thing I'm sure of is that I'm enneagram 9. I‚Äôd love if I could get help on confirming my type!

**Warning:** I don‚Äôt have that great of an understanding about the functions, so most of these may probably be stereotypes, but here‚Äôs my best shot. 

---

**Si:**

- I enjoy recalling past memories and experiences

- My memory for the past is better than most people I know

- I hate taking risks even if they‚Äôre small

- I dislike big changes such as new jobs and new schools, and take longer to adapt to these changes than necessary 

- I like knowing what to expect / the details of things (ex: who‚Äôs going to be at a hangout, when is it, where are we going, how long are we staying for, what are we doing?)

- I feel much more comfortable if I have a sense of familiarity. Being unfamiliar with a place or situation makes me uncomfortable

- I like stability and security

- I use what I know and have experienced in the past when working on present and future things 

**Why I second-guess Si:** I'm mostly only present-oriented. I would say I'm at least 85% focused on the present. Also although Si has nothing to do with anxiety, most Si users I know are prone to worrying while I'm mostly always nonchalant and complacent.

**Se:**

- I‚Äôm very present-oriented; I hardly think about the future, and the only time I think of the past is to recall memories when being reminded of them 

- I love designer items and wish to own many expensive, high-end things. I‚Äôm also a big spender who mostly spends money on appearance, and I dress for beauty not comfort

- I like trying new food as long as I know what the food is

- I just want to live in the moment and be happy even though I don‚Äôt actually do much 

- When seeing something, I‚Äôm more likely to describe what the thing looks/sounds/etc like than to associate it with a feeling or memory from the past 

- I almost never worry about anything and am more likely to just think, ‚Äúwell I can‚Äôt do anything about it, so I might as well just wait‚Äù or ‚Äúwhen the time comes, it‚Äôll come‚Äù and stuff like that

- I find the arts appealing; music, film making, photography, drawing, writing, etc. I‚Äôm also pretty creative myself, but not all that talented with the arts other than writing poetry and stories 

- I‚Äôm usually one of the first to notice something in my surroundings 

**Why I second-guess Se:** I don‚Äôt take interest in doing physical things like hiking, partying, raving, playing sports, and more. I also don't adapt/adjust to change that quickly unless I actually want the change, which isn't often. 

**Fi:**

- When someone says or does something, my first reaction is to think about my opinion or my feelings (in my mind)

- I dislike and am uncomfortable with expressing most of my feelings, so I keep them to myself 

- I care about morals and ethics; I dislike when people do unethical things like lie on a resume (or lie about anything), steal someone‚Äôs belongings because they forgot it somewhere, take credit for someone else‚Äôs work, and etc

- I don‚Äôt really care about norms and dislike some, such as shaking hands with people you meet, saying ‚Äúbless you‚Äù when people sneeze, and more 

- I stick to my values most of the time; I could agree to a hangout then not want to go anymore, but still go because I already agreed to it and I value keeping my word

- I‚Äôm pretty reserved and private with most people, and I take a long time to get comfortable with someone or to consider them ‚Äúclose‚Äù. I‚Äôve had the same friends since I was in elementary, but still don‚Äôt feel close to them even though they feel close to me

- I don‚Äôt take criticism well and can take defense to what someone says (misreading it as something rude when it wasn‚Äôt meant to be), but I don‚Äôt express any of this to them
 
- I look at many things as right/wrong or good/bad

- I hate when people try too hard to be something they aren‚Äôt, like when they change their entire image or personality to fit in with the cool kids 

**Why I second-guess Fi:** I don‚Äôt place high importance on myself being authentic, individualistic, or having a clear identity. I also don't talk about myself that much even though I enjoy talking about things in my interest.

**Fe:**

- I prefer to fit in with the crowd as opposed to stand out and be unique

- I follow a lot of beauty trends

- I‚Äôm accommodating and like to maintain harmony to avoid conflict. I have never gotten into conflict with a friend before

- I kind of care what people think about me, but mostly just to the point of avoiding people hating me

- A lot of my values are society‚Äôs values (ex: be respectful, polite, ethical)

- I‚Äôm extremely agreeable on the outside even though I don‚Äôt actually agree on the inside. I‚Äôd pretend to agree with my friends about something I actually disagree with because I want to avoid getting into an argument with them and because it‚Äôs just easier for myself to agree than to express my disagreement just for them to disagree, which will make me mad on the inside

- I don‚Äôt really have a sense of self; I have a hard time answering ‚Äúwho are you?‚Äù whenever asked

- Many people find me warm, friendly, and animated in my facial expressions and body language/hand gestures 

- I‚Äôm a pushover and easily taken advantage of. I let people get what they want all the time because I have trouble speaking up. Friends have said that I‚Äôm ‚Äútoo nice‚Äù.

**Why I second-guess Fe:** I don‚Äôt care about other people‚Äôs feelings and I don‚Äôt help people to make them happy unless I really like them. The reason why I sugarcoat, pretend to agree, and help people is to avoid conflict, so I can maintain harmony. However, I don‚Äôt care about group harmony; the entire group could be fighting, but as long as I‚Äôm not involved in the fight, I don‚Äôt care because I still feel at peace.

I have a questionnaire I recently filled out here in case anyone wants to look back on it. People there told me I'm probably ISFP, but on the mbti community I'm still getting a lot of ISFP and/or ISFJ answers. [Here it is](https://www.reddit.com/r/isfj/comments/6rxmph/could_i_be_an_isfj/)

I'm also willing to answer some questions if it could better help me find my type. Thanks!",1502999582
isfj,"I think I broke him. He's an enneagram 6 so a little different from your typical ISFJ enneagram 2 types, I believe. 

Anyways, I kind of used to handle him like glass because... I was being considerate of his sensitivities, as I can read it on his face pretty well, he seemed often easily .. not hurt I would say but... kind of.. like he doesn't take jokes well, if I call him out for something(always as a joke) he gets .. defensive..almost.. on guard? E.g., we were racing to the elevator and he got there first but I pushed past him inside just as the doors opened and I yelled ""HA, you lost to a girl, does that make you feel emasculated?"" (clearly joking since I lost) And he was just like, ""What? No..."" and he got that stubborn look on his face and it got awkward and I tried to brush it off and stuck my tongue out at him or something but damn was that an awkward elevator ride up. 

SO, I was treading carefully but then one day he sat me down and told me that he would prefer that I speak my mind so the next time something came up, I did. It was about sex. I tried to fix it. The sex pretty much sucked. So I told him how I felt about it (which is basically that I didn't like it and that I wanted to work on it) AND NOW HE WON'T LOOK ME IN THE EYE, he flinches when I touch him, and idk, he gets this stubborn look on his face, and it's been going on for awhile now and I'm about to dip out of this relationship real soon but....... I mean.. why don't I just give it a shot and ask y'all... how the flying fuck do I fix it? I didn't mean to offend his pride, he's extremely physically attractive so I don't know what he has to be insecure about, if it is insecurity... 

But the more he avoids me physically, the more he seems to approach me conversationally, especially over text, which is kind of hard because I'm not a great texter but I'm really making an effort here because I know I dip out of relationships too quickly and he's a pretty great dude.. 

Anyways... I don't know whats going on in his mind, maybe you guys will. I know I'm extremely upfront but it's never personal, more informative, I'm not really good at softening words, but I don't mean it to hurt or offend so maybe theres a way I can say things without it putting him on guard? 

Maybe I'm just not compatible with him or with this type in general... idk, I don't seem to come across many of you often. ",1502923452

isfj,"So I'm dating this girl(ISFJ) and my first impression was that she was calm and reserved and didn't let much people in. But every time I get suspicious about something it turns out my suspicion was right. It's usually about guys who like her snapchatting her. Or some guys texting her at odd hours, 2am-6am. And when I call her out on it she says it's nothing and then when I ask her if they have any kind of history it turns out that they either have confessed their love to her or were in a small relationship type thing. She insists she wants to be with me and wants us to be long term but I can't trust her or take what she says seriously when every time I dig, I find new things that are unsettling. I open up to her about any possible concern she may have but doesn't reciprocate. She's very sensitive and almost started crying when I asked her if she wanted to be in a relationship. I don't know what the hell is going through her head. Hoping you all could clarify for this analytical INTJ.",1502792561
isfj,"My brother is an ENFJ and we've had a pretty close relationship for a long time. Despite me being the older brother, I never tried to do the whole older brother dominance thing. I tried to have an equal relationship (we're 1.5 years apart) and make things as fair as possible and he always respected that.

We even moved out together for the first time for a little over a year to get used to independence (we both lived with parents for a long time) and it was fun to learn together. 

It's an interesting dynamic he was a lot better at long term planning and socializing with others and I was better at the smaller things. 

For example, he set up ideas for convienent watching of shows we like, shared account for paying paying bills, new stuff to cook, doing research on proper insurances, etc.

On the other hand, I tended to drive more since I had a hybrid (and he likes driving even less than me), I set up the shows and schedule/queue to watch, Im a lot more naturally good with directions, there's a few foods I was better than cooking than him so he trusted me with those, and I'm a lot better at managing money than him.

He's a lot more of a natural with people so he made lots of friends easily but it was good to see how an ENFJ thinks of people when they dont have to do the whole Fe being nice to everyone thing and how much a person can really get on their nerves.

Funnily enough, my brother started dating an ISFJ girl and I think they're great for each other. I'm also close with his girlfriend and we treat other like siblings and we have similarities in terms of personality and viewpoints and humor styles. I feel like I might have influenced my brother to have a thing for (healthy) ISFJs because ever since he started dating his ISFJ girlfriend he's had less motivation to interact with other people even on social media (which is how they met and my brother was actually more popular than her on Instagram by far)

My boss at my previous company was an ENFJ and I really respect him since he was always a forward thinker and he was great for helping me move forward and get more confident in my career.

I go to him for advice in my field from time to time and I like his positivity, open mindedness and knowledge.

Sadly the company I worked with him as a boss decided to close down the department and I can't work with him or the other cool employees anymore (but this new company I work at is great too).

That said, as you can tell I've had VERY good with experience with ENFJs and now they're one my favorite types.",1502727594

isfj,"Hello there, ENTJ here.  

My dad is an ISFP, and my stepmom/his ex-wife is an ISFJ.  They've been having an on-off relationship for 5 years now, and have broken up twice now.  She broke up with him both times because she had problems with him not being emotionally supportive as she would have liked, and his general ISFPness of not liking to be tied down and at her beck and call.  Having spent long amounts of time with the both of them around, a relationship with either of them can sometimes feel like walking on eggshells.

As of 6 months ago, my stepmom told me they were definitely not getting back together.  But due to a string of recent events this summer, her anxiety has risen to the point where I cannot stand to be around her.  Along with the anxiety came a renewed interest in trying to get back together with my dad.  In fact, she is supposedly 100% invested this reunion.  My dad is unsure about it, but willing to try for the sake of his kids with her.  They're both so stubborn and don't communicate their feelings well, so even if the relationship sucks, they'll both suffer in silence until it reaches a boiling point.

My question is, why might my ISFJ stepmom be suddenly interested in getting back with my dad?  I'm thinking it's just the anxiety and need for human companionship, and she's willing to settle for my dad.  Is it a long-term thing, or should I plan for her to become a barnacle in his life?  I'm just worried that my dad will get stuck in this loop all over again, when it took him several years to get back to total contentedness with his life.  I don't want her to just use him until she feels like she doesn't need him anymore.  My dad is already starting to feel some resentment from this new relationship, but he'll stick it out forever because he hates confrontation.  

I also want to continue to have a relationship with my dad, but he doesn't have any time because my stepmom has been so needy, and her and I are not currently on speaking terms (arose from her fictitious anxieties).  What do you think, ISFJ's?",1502477688
isfj,"I'm a female ENFP in love with a male ISFJ. We're in the same university club, and it's a small group in a small classroom, so when I'm talking (really loudly) to my friend he tends to overhear and replies to whatever I'm talking about. However, he doesn't say ""hi"" to me if he sees me (and I'm too shy to say hi first) and he doesn't go out of his way to talk to me either. Is there a chance?

isfj,"I recently met an ISFJ who may be one of the most beautiful woman I've ever laid eyes on. Physically she's like a work of art and mentally she seems normal. I'm very attracted to her caring side and it makes me want to praise her non-stop, although I hold myself back because I don't want to come off as over the top. But if I'm being completely honest she has me completely, drool from the mouth, infatuated.

I've been doing a lot of reading and I'm afraid that her not having that mental energy that I so often need to express to someone may be challenging in the long run. I feel that our relationship could be very loving, but I'm just afraid that after the butterflies subside we will see how different we truly are. At the same time, my desire to be with someone who is honest, faithful, and caring is strong and she basically embodies that to a tee. We are still pretty early on in the relationship and haven't committed to anything. I don't want to end up hurting her and myself by going through a rollercoaster relationship (this happened before with my ESFJ gf from high school).

isfj,"**Is there anything that may affect the way you answer the questions? For example, a stressful time, mental illness, medications, special life circumstances? Other useful information includes sex, age, and current state of mind.**

Female, 22, currently relaxed.

**Describe yourself as a person if you were to introduce yourself to someone else like in a cover letter. What kind of person are you and why?**

I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôd say in an actual cover letter if I were introducing myself, so I‚Äôm just going to describe myself. I‚Äôm easygoing, really relaxed most of the time, hardly get stressed or worried about things, and I love to enjoy life. I‚Äôm pretty lazy and I‚Äôm hard to motivate. Even if I want to do something like lose weight, it‚Äôs hard for me to actually get motivated and dedicate time and effort into losing weight, partially because I really love food. I don‚Äôt have life goals, I have no idea what I want to do in the future, and I‚Äôm not an ambitious person. I‚Äôm easy to get along with, can converse about many topics so I guess I‚Äôm pretty open-minded, and I like to keep things peaceful. Because I‚Äôm all about peace and comfort, I don‚Äôt like doing things out of my comfort zone and I‚Äôm very conflict-averse. I‚Äôm accommodating, have a hard time making any of my own decisions or taking initiative, and I‚Äôm an agreeable person. I typically either have strong opinions or no opinion at all (or not really). I‚Äôm extremely materialistic, have a hard time saving money, and I‚Äôm interested in anything aesthetically pleasing including fashion or anything beauty related, photography, and interior design. I‚Äôm not a risk taker, like stability and security, and have a good memory for detail. I‚Äôm ethical, reserved, shy, and it‚Äôs hard for me to get close to people and feel comfortable with them to the point where I‚Äôd open up or express my feelings to them. I‚Äôm pretty bad at dealing with people who are being emotional to me. I‚Äôm kind of a follower as opposed to a leader and I‚Äôm very passive and easily taken advantage of. 

**What were you like as a child? Think about how you were in school, with friends, and at home with your family.**

As a child, I was friendly and active; I liked playing sports as a child, but now I‚Äôm very physically inactive. In the classroom, I was a good student, but I was also quiet and hardly ever participated. A lot of my friends in school enjoyed bullying me, not because they thought something was wrong with me, but because they just thought it was fun to hit me or pick on me since I never did anything back to them and never spoke up for myself. At home with my family, I was helpful; I used to help my mom with chores a lot, and she said that I was fast with my hands, but that I‚Äôm now too slow. When I was still in elementary, I enjoyed going outside and traveling to random places with my siblings even though we had no idea where we were going. I wasn‚Äôt that obedient to my parents at home. I still did unsafe activities even though I was told not to, such as go out into the streets alone. 

**What kind of person would you LIKE to be? Why? What kind of person would you NOT want to be? Why?**

I‚Äôd like to be someone who‚Äôs kind, but able to stand up for themselves and speak up when necessary because I admire people like this. I also want to be someone who has their future envisioned and who are passionate about things because I‚Äôm not a passionate person and I have no future dream. I want to be someone who‚Äôs artistic and good at writing because even though my writing skills aren‚Äôt bad, I want to be even better. I also want to know how to draw really well. I want to be someone who has their shit together/planned out, and is achieving enough to actually go after what they want because those people work hard and have the motivation that I lack. 

I don‚Äôt want to be someone who‚Äôs unethical and selfish because I don‚Äôt like those kind of people. Those people who go after what they want at any means necessary without being concerned about how it‚Äôll affect other people annoy me. I don‚Äôt want to be someone who‚Äôs only concerned about money. I wouldn‚Äôt want to be someone who‚Äôs excessively pessimistic, worrying about things that could go wrong, and complaining all the time because they drain my energy and annoy me. I also don‚Äôt want someone who‚Äôs rude and lacks manner or someone who‚Äôs aggressive, competitive, and controlling. 

**Do you think there are any differences to how you described yourself and how people actually perceive you? How do you think others would describe you? If there are any discrepancies between these two that are you are aware of; do you know why exactly that is?**

For the most part, I believe the way I described myself is how people perceive me. One discrepancy is that people see me as lazier than I actually am because most of my friends are friends I made back in high school, and that was when I was so lazy to the point where it was too much. In high school, I didn‚Äôt care about my grades at all and I all I did was enjoy life and disregard my responsibilities like homework and studying. I‚Äôm a lot less lazy than I once was before. People also underestimate my intellect; a lot of my friends think I‚Äôm a bit dumb, but I‚Äôm actually not. Others would describe me as chill, funny, a spender, open-minded, shy, a pushover, slow-paced, too agreeable, nice, helpful, and friendly. They would also describe me as a homebody, lazy, easily irritated, indecisive, and two-faced. A long time ago, many people thought I was a big mouth who liked to gossip too much.

**What in life do you find to be of importance? Why?**

I believe it‚Äôs important to be happy and stress-free in life. I don‚Äôt think people should overwork themselves too much or expect too much out of life just in case they end up struggling to meet those expectations and as a result, get stressed out and/or unhappy. I believe it‚Äôs important to just do what makes you happy otherwise you‚Äôll live a life you won‚Äôt really like, and you might end up regretting the path you took because you aren‚Äôt living life how you prefer to live it. To me, happiness is more important than things like money or status. I also believe it‚Äôs important to treat others how you want to be treated, and to not deceive people.

**How do you react to new situations in your life? Can you describe an event in your life where you were in an unknown situation? How did you deal with it?**

I don‚Äôt adapt to change as quickly or easily as I‚Äôd like to. I feel like it might be because I‚Äôve become so comfortable and situated in a situation I‚Äôm already used to, and that makes me more hesitant to change. That along with not knowing what to expect. If the new situation isn‚Äôt anything too big (traveling, trying a new activity, etc) I‚Äôm fine with it for the most part. However it‚Äôs kind of bad if it‚Äôs something like a new job or anything that involves waiting to know what the outcome will be (good or bad). I was put in an unknown situation when I started working a completely different job, and I disliked not knowing how I‚Äôd end up performing after training, which was hard for me. Because of that, I quit during training. Another situation was when my family and I moved into a new house. For that, I reacted and adapted pretty well. I did prefer my old home, but it was easy for me to get used to living in the new house. 

**Please describe yourself when you are in a stressful situation. How do you act and why?**

When I‚Äôm stressed, I‚Äôm more easily irritated and prefer others to not bother me. Besides that, I don‚Äôt really know because I don‚Äôt catch myself stressed out that often. I guess I‚Äôm also more impulsive and irrational when I‚Äôm stressed out, and want to make hasty choices without thinking clearly first. 

**Describe your relationship to socialization. How do you perceive one-on-one interaction? How do you perceive group interaction?**

I‚Äôm okay with socializing if it isn‚Äôt for too long because if it‚Äôs too long, I start to get tired. One on one interactions are nice if I‚Äôm comfortable with the person and they‚Äôre easy to talk to, but if not then I prefer group interaction. Actually just in general, I prefer group interaction because I can listen more than speak whereas in a one to one interaction, it‚Äôs always a back and forth exchange between me and the other person. If I‚Äôm not involved in the interaction though, I find one on one interactions more appealing because they seem more intimate and from an outside perspective, it would seem like the two people have a really strong connection. However for me personally, I‚Äôd rather be involved in a group interaction. 

**Describe your relationship to society. What are the elements of it you hold important or unimportant (e.g. social norms, values, customs, traditions)? How do you see people as a whole?**

I'd say that most social norms, values, customs, and traditions are okay, but I don't care whether or not they should be kept or followed. However there are some social norms and etc that I don't particularly agree with. I don't have much of an opinion on people as a whole. I guess some people are cool whereas some people are annoying. One thing I always think is that people should stop trying so hard to be who they aren't to the point where they'd do something like act rude to others just because their friends are like that. I feel like many people make things complicated when they don't have to be. Other than all of that, I actually don't pay that much attention to society or anything.


**Describe your relationship to authority. How do you perceive authority? What does it mean to you, and how do you deal with it?**

I don‚Äôt really like authority because many people abuse the power they have. I also dislike authority because I feel like people should treat everybody equally, so I don‚Äôt find things like authority, hierarchy, and power appealing. Even if I was in a position of power, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd want to exercise it. In terms of my relationship, I listen to those in authority even if I don‚Äôt want to just in case something bad happens to me if I don‚Äôt obey them. 

Describe your relationship to order and chaos. What do order and chaos mean to you? How do they manifest in your daily life?

I don‚Äôt have much of an opinion on order, but I dislike chaos because I like having at least a little bit of control over my situation just so things don‚Äôt go out of hand and turn super chaotic, which would be hard for me to deal with.
 
**What is it that you fear in life? Why? How does this fear manifest to you both in how you think and how you act?**

I don‚Äôt have any strong fears, but I guess I would say that I fear conflict because it‚Äôs hard for me to deal with and because I don‚Äôt want to make enemies with anyone since it would feel so awkward if I have to see them, knowing that we got into some issues and dislike each other. It‚Äôs also just something that makes me uncomfortable. This manifests in how I think and act in that I fear conflict to the point of not standing up for myself even for the simplest things ever, and I can‚Äôt even speak up when I know it‚Äôs necessary to. Other than that, I also fear public speaking because I hate attention and feeling like people are possibly judging me for either how I look/sound or how my presentation is. 

**What is it that you desire in life? What do you strive to achieve? Why? Where do you think these drives and desires stem from or are inspired by?**

I desire a happy, relaxed life as well as my ideal appearance. I desire all the designer items on my wishlist. I also desire stability and financial security. I don‚Äôt know what I strive to achieve lol.

**What activities energize you most? What activities drain you most? Why?**

The activities that energize me most include listening to music, watching shows and movies, eating good food, being on the computer, and relaxing at home. The activities that drain me the most include being out for too long, being in crowded areas, listening to someone talk excessively without giving me a turn to reply, and anything too physically active. 

**Finally, is there something else you find to be of importance you want to add about yourself you think might be of relevance when helping to type you?**

- My enneagram is 9w1 SP, tritype 269 I think (not in that order). 
- My temperament is phlegmatic and sanguine
- I‚Äôm not nice or helpful because I care about other people or want them to be happy, but because I either feel obligated to help, want to avoid conflict/haters, or feel like I should be doing something (like holding the door for others, etc) because it‚Äôs the right thing to do. 
- I‚Äôm good at reading other people‚Äôs motives and usually pick up vibes about their character when first meeting them. 
- I dress for appearance, not for comfort
- I‚Äôve been through a lot of phases in life such as a preppy phase, a gothic phase, a tomboy phase, a scene phase, and stuff like that when I was in my teen years.

isfj,"She won't allow me to have a life outside of her. I lost all my friends because of her. I can't even go see my family. It is all about her. She can have all the friends she wants, and her family is oh so important. My family and friends can basically take a hike for all she cares.. She doesn't out and say this. It is just how she is. It is all about her all the time. How I can please her. I am her pet.

I'd bring her everywhere in the beginning. She had no issues hanging with friends. I didn't want to make her feel not included. There is times where a guy needs to get out and blow of steam with his friends.

 Her whole persona was a front to what was to come. Over time she became extremely possessive and jealous.
I never did anything to make her like this. She just didn't want to share me. Made everything about her all the time. I only go around her friends now. I can't make plans unless they are with her. She can run around and do anything she wants. I am fine with it. It just pisses me off that she thinks it is okay that she does things she won't allow me to do. I even explained this to her. She said, 'fine, i won't hangout with my friends anymore.' I said, 'yes, I want you to see how it feels.' This lasted maybe two days and she is asking me if she can go out. of course I let her. I tell her I am not going to stop her from doing what she wants, or having friends. I don't feel the need to control people. 

This is very hard for me being an ENTP. I am getting very fed up with everything. I feel like I am going to run away and just party my face off and jump off a cliff in the end because I am so wound up from being stuck in a game where she is the victim all the time.
I can't breath anymore. Leaving is going to cost me a lot. I invested so much into this. I should pack up and just go..


 I recently reconnected with a best friend I gave up just to keep her from nagging me all the time. Now we had plans today to go jog around the lake and last minute she is making it about her. I didn't invite her, so I am rude and I don't think about her. All I do is think about her. I just need a break from her constant pity parties.. I feel like I am a jerk because she makes me out to be the bad guy for absolutely nothing all the time. Even when I try to have sex with her she makes me out to be a piece of shit. She will say she is tired and then in the next breath ask for a massage. I almost massage this girl every day. She has massaged me like four times in our four year relationship. 

She is so needy. Everything I do has a possible bad reaction from her. It can be the smallest things that sets her off. She is so emotional about every little thing. I feel like I am walking on landmines with her. She can be fine all day and I say one thing that provokes a emotional reaction and she will stew in it for the days. 

I 100% sure she is an ISFJ. There is no doubt about it. Not all is bad about her, but damn she is hard to please. Like, one time she kicked me out for going out with friends, then I started packing my stuff and she threw a fit. Started crying and throwing my stuff around.. 

This girl came from a good home. She is very high up in her career and well respected. I am the one who she takes her anger out on. I don't know what to do..",1501799483
isfj,"I've had a few ESTPs Ive interacted well with: one who I really love a lot and one who I had mixed feelings with.

One thing I think is good about them in general is they know how to  have fun without being as loud as say as an Extroverted Fi user.

The first ESTP I know was basically my second mother growing up. She essentially did all the household cores a bunch of the cleaning and babysitting while parents were at work.

I think at that point of taking care of me she had very developed Fe because she knew how to be nurturing without being overbearing (which my ISFJ and ESTJ parents could be pretty often).

I'd say her ESTP traits tend to show more when she talks about her past or once she leaves the house to have fun. She has a strong attitude of ""If you got a shitty situation just do what you can to find and make the best of it"". THere are other things more personal I could talk about it but I'll say it defines her as ESTP more.

Due to her situation she kinda has to rely on her friends to pick her up to hang out since she doesnt have drivers license but she keeps saying that if she could drive she'd almost never be at home when not working.

As for the other ESTP, he was a previous coworker. His job tended to be talking to clients and adapting to their needs well. The thing he sometimes had a case of ""making promises he possibly couldn't keep"" thing which meant delaying things.

This isn't true with all of my friends of course, but it's something that happens very often, usually with the more clingy people. Somehow, I don't realize how unhealthy the relationship is and how little the person actually cares about me- this behavior is basically just using me as a fucking therapist. While I love playing the therapist and giving people advice and listening to their troubles, I feel like shit when this part of me is taken advantage of.

Is there a way to stop these kinds of unhealthy relationships early?
What are some warning signs I can look for early on?
And how can I ""put myself out there"" so to speak without feeling like a burden? 

Is it fair to expect others to listen to me with the same attention and consideration I give to them, or is it more uncomfortable for others and something I shouldn't push, and accept?

Do Si-doms like daydreaming and how often? If so what would they normally daydream about ( would the daydreams include alternate realities based on real life events with out going over board or could the daydreams include totally fantastical worlds filled with magic and made up creatures etc )?

Do Si-doms take things in face value( I saw someone from a tumblr blog say this and I know i shouldnt take it seriously but i just wanted to make sure )?

Does strength of imagination correlate with someone's type and if so, how?

If the previous question is true then what would be the strength of imagination for an Si-dom and how much would they rely on it?

isfj,"I'm an INTJ and I don't usually get the whole flirting thing. So it's especially hard to catch when a girl is flirting with me. So a few months ago a new girl got a job where I work (small pet store) and I was instantly attracted to her. She's really cute but also I tend to be attracted to more caring types and this girl just cares about everything, it was adorable. She's super nice to everyone and just all the great qualities that come with an ISFJ. I always just assumed she was being nice when talking to me and was just one of those types of people that just want to know about people and so they ask you a bunch of questions. Anyways I brushed off a lot of what I know think was flirting, after finding out her type, or at least signs that she liked me. 
   Asking if I wanted to help her restock shelves and the whole time asking me about what I dream about or talking about our personal lives and laughing at really bad jokes and saying how funny I am while calling me a dork or saying how sweet i am.
   Finding out I've taken LSD and I smoke and then saying multiple times how we should ""go halves"" and go the beach together. 
    Coming over and asking if I need help with something that's clearly a one person job and admitting it was just an excuse to hang out with me.
    Mentioning many times that she like my beard or hair and then the last time adding in ""I like your face, you're cute.""
    Always asking how I'm doing the first thing when she sees me at work and then the second being ""are you closing?"" (she always closes).
    Inviting me over to hang out sending the text at 8pm saying ""just finished showering and smoking and and thought of you. I wanted to see if you wanted to come over and hang out, maybe watch some tv or something, i just really need a friend."" and then actually telling me to come over at 10pm and then tell me she has to sneak me in. When I get there she says ""sorry I'm not cute"" while wearing what i can only describe as a lingerie type robe kind of deal (tied) with just the top of a black lace bra showing. Lets me pick a movie and we smoke on her bed while she's laying on her side, so that the curve of her body is accentuated with her ""lingerie"" draped over her. The movie ends and she says I can put another one on and since we basically just looked at her tumblr and laughed and talked the first movie then it was a good idea. We end up watching a scary movie and shes getting fidgety ie. feet start squirming suspiciously close to mine and hands are doing the same to my hands. she asks if I want to cuddle and then immediately lays her head on my chest and her arm across me to stop on the other half. she then made her body flush with mine draping her leg over my crotch and down my leg and began playing with my beard. 

Now until I got to her house I admit I had suspicions but nothing really shot out. When i got there I immediately started to think about reevaluating her feelings for me. (Friends don't usually where what she was wearing as something to hang out in). But it wasn't until I felt the foot wiggles i thought she was into me. then the cuddling and the beard playing basically confirmed everything. 

As an INTJ i dont do intimate situations like that unless I'm prepared. I thought we were friends up until 12:30am that morning so I was extremely nervous and had to concentrate 35% on not getting hard 40% on keeping my heartbeat steady 15% on not getting distracted by her hair smelling nice and then 10% on the actual movie. By this point I was trying not to fuck anything up  and so after the movie ended I left @1:30am.

Her interaction with me definitely changed with me after that. Still asking how i was doing or seeing if i closed but everything else cut back significantly. I can tell when I have to put more effort into a relationship to compensate for the lack of effort from the other party. After I tell her I think i fucked up that night because I'm actually into her she tells me she doesn't like me like that and just wants to be friends. She then pulled away significantly more to the point which I feel like shes avoiding me now. (Could be the copious amounts of hickies on her neck and arms and she doesn't want to make it awkward, but idk). 
   It seemed like she was interested but has now stated 2 times she just wants to be friends (the second being unnecessary) and that shes sorry for the misunderstanding. I'm just really confused but hey thanks for reading this far. any insight would help  ",1500276676

I would say that I am an average male that goes to university, possibly above average looks and not completely socially awkward, so an eligible partner for someone.. somewhere. Anyways, seemingly as a typical ISFJ male, I have not had a wealth of experience with girls, am extremely timid and shy in 50/50 situations I can't envisage the outcome of. I am also self-sabotager when girls show interest who I am not interested in, and feel terrible about it afterwards. In other words, ""what are you doing man?"", is what I say to myself a lot. I had a few girlfriends when I was at school, however they were more ""girlfriends"". I could hardly say they were serious.

So I have pretty much been in love with the same girl for a year, and finally got the courage to ask her out yesterday. She said no, that she liked me as a person etc. Working up the courage to ask her out was difficult enough, but being rejected after putting my whole self on the line was extremely terrifying as an experience. As one would naturally expect, I was crushed and cried myself to sleep, wallowing in self pity (haha).

So she is my co-worker and today I knew I would be around her at work and I assumed my world was about to crumble. I promised to myself I would at least be brave upon first interaction. I have no idea when or how this happened, but the moment I said hi to her, I did not sink into myself but rather owned the person who I am. It was like I matured instantly. I was not awkward and didn't actively avoid her, which was definitely something I thought would happen to me in the past. Although the pain of rejection hurts, I don't feel like I am the one with the problem (not totally, though) and even going so far to think that maybe she might have missed out on me. I've not really felt this confident in a long time.. which is completely strange as I thought I would be in the dumps for weeks.

I'm not sure what I actually meant with this post, but just wanted to share it anyways. So all of you tentative ISFJs, I say seize the moment. Do not be like me and wait a year to ask someone out, because you may be holding your own self back. The asking wasn't even that bad! It was slightly exhilarating. Now of course it is not all blue skies ahead, I will probably feel sad about this in the near future.. but at least I know that there were some positives to come from this otherwise bleak situation.

tl;dr: feel weirdly refreshed and confident after being rejected from someone I was in love with. Gonna be sad at some points but mainly surprised and happy I have grown from this situation.",1499611618

We would be constantly in contact throughout the day, and as such, we were pretty close when we began the relationship. We both confessed our love for each other within the first couple months of the 'official relationship.'

For me to openly confess my emotions, I need to feel safe and cared for by the other person. I need to feel like the two of us can work through whatever life throws at us (and we did at times), so when the relationship ended so soon, it really hit me hard. I actually felt worse from this relationship ending than my previous 5-year relationship.

It made me think about the impact of duration of relationships and what it actually means afterward. For me, when I fall in love with someone, there will always be a part of me who will love the person in the future -- who will wish the best for them, even if the relationship ended on bad terms -- but I do not know if I can really be friends anymore.

isfj,"Okay, the title is a bit misleading. I'm mainly hoping for some insight about my ex who is an ISFJ.

So often times when I would talk about an interesting experience or thought I had or something I emotionally was going through, he would barely ask me follow up questions. I often felt like I was talking to a wall. I felt neglected. I would have to say things like ""Yeah....so are you going to ask me what I mean?"" Or ""So are you gonna ask me for more details on what happened or not?"" And when I said this, 1 of 2 things would happen:

1) He would ask a question just for the sake of asking it, AFTER I mentioned it. It would also be something along the lines of ""Oh Im sorry. So yeah tell me more about it I'd like to know"" To which I'd say ""More about what exactly? What do you want to know?"" because I could sense that he was just grasping at straws :/

or 2) He would go into defense mode, getting offended and saying that he was going to ask or that he was listening or that he didnt know I wanted him to ask or something of that sort, to which I would proceed to explain my feelings but instead of realizing it was something that hurts me it would just turn into a big argument because I guess he either got annoyed or felt bad about himself for not being able to (I actually don't know, any ideas?)

So my question is, are ISFJs generally like this? Do you guys find it hard to come up with questions? Are you guys generally minimal conversationalists? And if so, why? If not, why was my ex like this? I know that some of the topics I'd talk about weren't his forte so instead he'd just like listening to me. But I didnt always want a sounding board as much as I wanted a conversational partner who would catch my drift, get on my wavelength, you know what I'm saying? I just feel really bad looking back and realizing there were so many moments such as these. I was left to assume that he just doesnt care and is pretending, which I know was probably not the case.

Another thing that'd happen a lot is that I would tell him to talk to me about something because it would always feel like I was bringing up the topics. And he'd just tell me some sensory details of what happened during his day or something about sports, which wasnt what I was looking for. In the end, both parties just end up feeling bad. 

disclaimer: it wasnt ALWAYS like this. there were times when he was very attentive, curious, analytic even. there were also times where he would bring up cool things to talk about. it was never like suuuper deep and crazy, but still satiated me. ",1498080889

My ex was ISFJ (I'm an INFJ) and I would smoke around him quite a few times as I like to smoke.

However, I think he felt that I was pressuring him when really I just wanted to have an open conversation about WHY or WHY NOT he didn't want to, so I could address any concerns he had. It was hard for him to have this conversation because he just ended up feeling bad. Anyway, he agreed he wanted to try it with me and I was planning how and where it would be to ensure him to have the best experience...but we never got around to it and he would never actually bring it up, so I felt like it didn't really appeal to him which was upsetting. I confronted him about it, and he said that he DID want to try it but that he wasn't dying to. I know he liked drinking though because it was more of an acceptable thing and it made him more outgoing. Just trying to gain insight...",1498062542

isfj,"You all are so cordial and wonderful to friends and family. I have have had some signs that my crush (an ISFJ) is maybe interested in me romantically, but it could also just be how you are all such wonderful at making people feel comfortable and at home. Are there any specific clues when feelings pass that friendship / romantic interest line?

To add more detail: he's told me i am a true friend and he loves me for it. We have been camping together, when i say love me or leave me, he replies he's not left. I've spent the night at his house and he said he was glad i felt comfortable enough to do it. And we hug often. He has even talked about us living together, but also later said that i would be fine living alone when i have expressed that i dont believe i ever could live alone. But then it seems like there is a wall up, that things are only to go so far, and no more. Is that his shyness or is that the friendship line that i shouldnt cross? I dont want to jeopardize our friendship, but hes the only guy I've felt i can depend on and so serious about. The thought of ""the rest of my life commitment"" doesnt scare the crap out of me with him.

Also, I am not sure I am his type. I'm kinda messy and and INFP. More on the dreamy, illogical side. But there have been what, the intuitive side of me, would call signs of a romantic interest from him. But my intuition isn't always correct. So I'm asking all you wonderfully grounded people for advice.",1497671822

isfj,"I've always kinda chose to never seek out and have a 'romantic' relationship with anyone. There is another thread going on about deep connections with others that hit close to home that made me start thinking if others feel the same way. I don't think there is anyone that I can say I have a 'deep connection' with... I thought I did recently, but it isn't working out. Am I lonely? Sometimes, but not very often... It's usually when I see my friends 'happy' in their relationships. It always fades after I go home, back into my comfort zone. I honestly adore being alone on those days that I don't have 'anything' to do; and I kinda don't want to change it... I don't think I want a family, or kids... Long story short, I'm very happy with my lifestyle right now, however, often times I wonder what it would be like to have someone else around; since I hate doing 'things' without a 'friend' around to do it with... 

With that out of the way, I've come to the conclusion that after observing and watching others around me always seemingly to fail in their own relationships for various reasons, (the one that always sticks out to me is my observation of how much damn work it takes to maintain a relationship) You know how we are; ISFJs, we are always 'there' to help others with their problems and give them advice on how to fix it. My logic I placed onto myself for a long time now to avoid the issue; I've chosen to never seek one out. A friend says I'm afraid of commitment. That's not the case since I'm great with *my* obligations; Work, paying bills, rent, dieting (I lost 75 lbs!), keeping my space clean, taking care of pets, car maintenance, etc... I just don't want anything to do with all the crap you have to deal with in a relationship. Do any other ISFJs feel the same way by chance?",1497483420

isfj,"Female infj here. For a while now I've been spending time with a male isfj in a small group setting, as he is a friend of a friend. There is obvious chemistry between us, and at this point I believe he knows I am interested in him ( I also believe he is interested in me).

The problem is, he is incredibly shy with me one on one. Like, to the point where he can only say one word at most, and will not make eye contact. Over time, with our small group of friends, he has grown to be flirty with me, but it seems the moment we are alone he is paralyzed.

I can relate, as I am very nervous around him as well, but not in such an extreme manner. However, my problem is we don't text, and things are moving very slowly. I know he deals with anxiety, so I was thinking of asking him out.

Male isfj's, how would you like to be approached when being asked out? How can I avoid scaring him? I am somewhat social awkward myself, so I haven't found a way to naturally suggest texting. Honestly, I was hoping to ask him out tomorrow night after our group goes to the movies.

isfj,"Hello. I am an isfj male 23yo. I was in a serious relationship (for 2 years) and broke up a year ago. Now I am in a new relationship but I don't feel very connected with her like I was in the previous one. I do really like this girl and want to see things through but somehow I feel that there is a barrier that prevents us to connect on a more deeper level. We've only been dating for about a month if that helps and she is 19 years old. 

Some background story on my previous relationship: the girl was an ESTP I believe. Bottom line was that towards the end of the relationship, she wasn't too eager to hang out with me anymore and preferred spending time with others besides me. I later found out that she had been cheating. 

So I guess my concerns are:

1.) I find it hard to fully trust my SO now even though I know that she's not the same person. I always have anxiety that the same thing might happen again every time I'm away from her. 

2.) when we hang out, and we're just relaxing and cuddling, sometimes it's just quiet and we don't talk about anything so I feel pressured to come up with an interesting conversation. I'm not sure if that's just the way she is (we've only been dating for a month) but sometimes it makes me think that she probably finds me boring which leads me back to my #1 concern. I had her take a personality test once and she tested as an ENFJ. 

3.) I am well aware that couples need space but I feel that I'm happiest when I'm around her even though sometimes we don't do much. I don't want to appear needy to her but that's what ends up happening whenever I get into a relationship. I want to spend every moment I can with them. 

I'm pretty sure I can keep going with the list but I'll keep it short. Basically it all ties into my #1 concern which is anxiety over her leaving because I'm not good enough for her. I felt this way because of how the previous one ended and I feel like it deeply damaged my self esteem. 

Are there any advice you guys can give me as far as overcoming/coping with these feelings. I know that if I don't do something about it now, it will end up dooming the relationship. I want to be better and I want to completely get rid of these walls that I have so that I can allow myself to fully invest my all into this new relationship. ",1496803032

I spoke to her god-mother(not sure if that's a thing but, best I could translate) who is in a very good relationship with her mother, so she knows a lot about her, she told she seems kinda sad, and is unwilling to do stuff - like go out and she doesn't truly have friends to hang out with.
She's been single for all I know (but didn't seem to me she had any attraction towards me). 
(Also not really go out with her either, but still...) 
My question is - should I talk to her about this? Should I go after her, ask her what's really troubling her, or are ISFJ girl like this sometimes and there's nothing I could do about it?

isfj,"As an ISFJ, I notice that I hold a very tunnel vision outlook on the people that are important to me, especially when feelings are involved.

I open up to and trust people based on words supported by their actions. This acts as a filter to the people I want to be around and has sometimes lead to romantic feelings. I then take a considerable amount of time observing them and determine whether or not I simply have fleeting feelings for them, or if there is something more genuine that is developing organically. 

When I've determined that I like someone romantically, I dedicate my time and attention as any ISFJ would to fulfill the caretaker role. I struggle greatly dividing my attention to other people that have captured my attention because I feel I need to be ""loyal/faithful/genuine"" to one person at a time. When I realize that a situation isn't healthy for me, I try to move on but struggle because:

* 1) I committed myself to one person 
* 2) Have to spend time to determine if new person is just a fling or something more  
* 3) Emotional hurdles from past experiences 
* 4) Letting go of everything that you've put into a previous relationship 

TL;DR - prioritize one person at a time, cannot move on as easily because of trust issues and requires a considerable amount of time to observe before committing. 

Just want to know if these are ISFJ-wide challenges, and also looking for insight based on previous experiences and how to handle our feelings and a strong sense of caretaking.

isfj,"Hi! 

*tl;dr*:
I'm wondering a few things, and I'd be very thankful if you'd like to take the time to answer!

* what is your prefered way of communicating your needs?
* what makes you feel appreciated and loved, and how do you show other people love?


*more detailed version:*
The reason I'm asking is that I (enfp) am in a relationship with an isfj and while we suit each other well, there are a couple of hiccups that we have a hard time finding a solution to. So I thought I'd ask you and then check back in with him and see if any of it resonates with him. 

*So far our biggest issues are:*

* Clashing love languages. He likes practical things, like doing stuff around the house, etc. I have ADHD, so cleaning and keeping things organized is hard for me because I constantly misplace stuff and forget about taking out the trash etc. I really do try, but I know he finds it very frustrating. My love language is more physical and verbally expressive, which he doesn't seem to feel comfortable with, and that makes me feel kind of unappreciated, because I am really trying my hardest at talking to him in his love language and not getting much back. I do know he loves me very much, but I need him to show it too.

* Different ways of communicating. I like talking pretty frequently, both about the good and the bad stuff. Just checking in and see the lay of the land so to speak. He however is oblivious of any need to talk until he realizes something has been eating at him for several weeks, so he doesn't raise his concerns until much later, even if I ask him if there's something he would like to change.

* Clashing energy levels. I am an extrovert and I spend my days mostly alone because of my line of work. He is an introvert and works with people, so at the end of the day when we can hang out I have a lot of energy and he is completely pooped.

isfj,"Hi ISFJs. I would like some advice or input from your perspective.

I (25F, INFP) have had a best friend for 19 years (25F, ISFJ). We met in school and stayed close through college. Our differences in personality seemed to grow stronger near the end of our senior years, but at this point the two of were essentially family. She is like my sister, and I can't ever see not having a relationship with her. 

I moved away from home after graduating and met my current boyfriend (28, INTJ) a year ago, who I now live with. My best friend has met him twice. The first time was over lunch in my home town, the second time was when she came to visit for the day in the city I live in now. 

The problem is, I don't think she likes him.

Over Easter, my boyfriend visited with me again and I asked my best friend if she would want to try having a double date with us. I had already spent several days with her to catch up (her boyfriend was with us at that time). I really like her boyfriend. I want her to have a similar relationship with mine, but she never seems interested in spending much time around him, even though I have told her (we had a big fight about it a few months ago) that this really hurts my feelings.

She completely skipped the opportunity for us to go out on a double date by not committing or acting enthusiastic about the idea at all. I am pretty sure she spent the evening with her own boyfriend as a pre-Easter couple celebration (they were apart for the actual holiday). I know the two of them are in the honeymoon phase and I want them to be happy... but I don't understand her behavior. This was her one chance to show some initiative and support. My boyfriend and I won't be back in town for at least another 6-8 months.

I don't know if she just feels really protective of me or if this is some other issue. Can any of you shed some light on this for me? I'm tired of being angry at her. I want to make sure we can maintain our friendship without me winding up hating her. But any time I bring it up she never gives me a straight answer (I assume to prevent hurting my feelings). I want to know what she's thinking or figure out how to fix the situation.

isfj,"Hello,

I just finished my fourth year of my English Honors degree, and I thought I wanted to pursue law after graduating, but the more I study for the LSAT, meet lawyers, and visit law firms, the more I feel like a legal career doesn't suit me. I did a personality test, found out that I'm an ISFJ, and found that an attorney is one of the least popular careers for an ISFJ. 

I'm also doing well in my English degree, but I can't see myself writing essays for the rest of my life (i.e. I don't think I'll enjoy becoming an academic or journalist).

One of the jobs listed as being most suitable for an ISFJ was an interior designer. As I've always loved design, art and the concept of space, I'm now considering to pursue an interior design degree. However, that would take another 4 years which I'm not sure I'd be able to handle financially. Instead, I could pursue a masters in elementary education which would only take 2-3 years. I would also be more likely to find a job. 

I think both jobs have their pros and cons. I love the idea of designing spaces for people, but daunted by the idea of having to deal with the meticulous architecture details. I also love the idea with working with children, but I get physically worn out very easily.

(Note: for this summary, we will be using the term ""[extravert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraversion_and_introversion)"" as used in clinical analysis initiated by Carl Jung instead of the popularized spelling, ""extrovert."" )

# Introduction

The Movers &amp; Makers company is engaged in ongoing research about introverts, extraverts, age, occupation, and communication preferences. The original hypothesis was that introverts, or individuals in introvert-friendly occupations such as STEM, were more adverse to having a phone call disrupt their time, with some exceptions. In contrast, extraverts, or individuals in extravert-friendly occupations, were more open to phone calls. Our formal interviews showed this hypothesis to be incorrect and revealed a trend based more on age and occupation than temperament.

As an informal triangulation of our data, The Movers &amp; Makers research team decided to conduct surveys on popular social media and internet forums. The research has not yet concluded, but ""Phase 1"" of these informal surveys are complete and we'd like to share the results of these surveys. The results of this informal survey coincided with our formal research and also contradicted the original hypothesis. This summary is not an analysis of our hypothesis, our formal research, or of the informal research. This summary is only a brief overview of the informal survey results.

# Summary

In addition to essential demographic questions, the questions of the survey took the form of ""I work for a company that has never done business with you and I'd like to introduce myself."" The possible answers included, ""Call your phone number,"" ""Send you an email,"" ""Send you an SMS,"" ""Send you an MMS,"" and ""Send you an IM."" We also asked two, somewhat open-ended questions that emphasized the positive and negative consequences of the communication preferences.

## Overall Preferences

Our initial observations, which initiated our research, were that there are some people that don't like to be called on the phone and would prefer to be contacted by other means. This survey supported the observation with less than a third of respondents preferring  a phone call (31.3%) over alternative methods. Email was the preferred method by half of the respondents (49.6%).

[Overall Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/UmRoBq3)

Granted, the spectrum of scenarios may have been biased toward phone-call-aversion, so this is not an absolute reflection of preferences, but merely a summary of the preferences reflected in this survey. 

### Introvert-Extravert Preferences

Breaking down the data between introverts and extraverts yielded an insignificant difference between the two temperaments. Introverts preferred a phone call in 30.61% of responses. Extraverts preferred a phone call in 31.41% of responses. This is a difference of only 0.8% and is much smaller than we anticipated.

[Introvert Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/p7S4Djk)

[Extravert Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/9eww0um)

The similarities between introvert and extravert coincide with our formal research and are also reflected in the breakdown of most of each questions that follow.

#### Ambivert Preferences

While ""ambivert"" is not a part of some personality/temperament models, many contemporary research make allowances for ambiverts. In our case, we are including the term because people that identify as ambiverts seem themselves as distinct from both extraverts and introverts and they may have a distinct profile. However, the number of respondents describing themselves as Ambiverts is too small to comprehensively study and we recommend a more in-depth study of ambiverts and communication preferences.  Still, as a note of interest, we'll include the results here, though we caution against drawing any conclusions. Ambiverts responded with a preference for email at 54.6% and phone calls at 19.2%.

[Ambivert Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/5CHYPha)

### Male-Female Preferences

Our original hypothesis did not account for sex or gender. We allowed for the selection of ""sex"" in the survey to satisfy any curiosity of biological temperament selection. As we suspected, there isn't a large or significant difference in correlation of sex to communication preferences as borne out in our formal research and reflected in these survey results.

Overall, male respondents selected a preference for a phone call in 34% of responses with females selecting phone calls in only 28.6% of responses. Email was the preferred response for both males and females in 49.3% and 49.7% of responses respectively.

#### Gender and Non-traditional Genders

We specifically did not include the word ""gender"" in this survey because the study of gender is outside of the scope of our current research. We allowed for the answers of ""Prefer not to say,"" and ""Other"" with an open field to promote the completion of the survey, but this survey is not equipped to tackle gender. Even with this allowance, only 0.1% of respondents answered with a non-traditional sex. Of that 0.1%, some of the respondents showed open hostility to the survey in their comments, indicating that this answer was not truly reflective of the respondent. The answers from these respondents were removed from our analyzed results.

That does not mean, however, that we do not value research regarding gender. We believe that the identification of gender and that correlation to communication preference might be quite significant. It is simply that we have not begun to tackle the question at this time. We would openly welcome input or recommendations from anyone with knowledge or expertise in this area.

### Generational Preferences

The first of two areas with distinctive responses is the difference in generation. The age groups that we call ""Millennials"" are the least resistant to phone calls, with 31.6% of responses, and yet 48.4% of the Millennial responses prefer email. Millennials were also more open to ""alternative"" communication methods such as IM, SMS, etc. with about 20% of the responses in total.

The age groups that we call ""Generation X,"" or ""Gen X,"" are slightly more resistant to phone calls with only 29.1% of responses preferring a phone call and 57.3% preferring email.

[Gen X Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/mAotSZr)

The age groups that we call ""Baby Boomers,"" or just ""Boomers"" are the most resistant to phone calls with only 23.6% of responses preferring a phone call and 72.7% preferring email. Boomers were the most resistant to ""alternative"" communication methods with only 3.6% of responses for SMS and zero responses for the other methods.

[Boomer Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/U7Yng1Z)

### Occupational Preferences

The second of two areas with distinctive responses is the difference in occupation, or, occupational ""wings"" as we call them. These wings are simply divided into occupations that are [STEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics)-related and non-STEM-related. The survey results reinforced our formal research and part of our hypothesis that respondents in STEM-related fields are more resistant to phone calls than their non-STEM peers. Respondents in STEM-related fields responded with 23.5% of responses preferring phone calls and 57.4% preferring email.  

[STEM-Related Occupation Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/QnwxZOc)

Responses in non-STEM-related occupations were more receptive to phone calls, but only with 34.2% of the responses and 46.7% preferring email.

## Scenario Preferences

We asked respondents to imagine a range of hypothetical scenarios and how they'd prefer to be contacted in those scenarios. The scenarios spanned a variety of business-oriented communications that fall onto a spectrum what we term ""cold to hot"" in order indicate the amount of familiarity the two parties have already established. We also asked about preferences in various degrees of urgency and responsibility.

It is probably unsurprising that the more distant and less urgent relationships are the most resistant to phone calls and the nearest and more urgent relationships are the most receptive to phone calls. In the ""coldest"" scenario, *I work for a company that has never done business with you and I'd like to introduce myself*, responses were predictably low on preferring a phone call with only 8% of responses and 85% preferring email. In this scenario, the differences between introvert and extravert were negligible, but the differences in generation were in-line with the overall responses. STEM and non-STEM responses were also in agreement with the overall responses.

[Cold Business Introduction Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/65J1a3r)

Also, predictably, the ""hottest"" scenario, *I have an emergency (business emergency, not life or death)*, included 74.6% of responses favoring a phone call and 5.9% preferring email. As an interesting note, in this scenario, more respondents preferred SMS to email with 13.7% of the responses.

[Emergency Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/IOxd25R)

The scenarios that emphasized cool or hot combined with responsibility, however, were a little surprising. For the scenario, *I'm a customer with a question (it's your responsibility to answer customer questions),* the responses were similar to the warm business responses. 19% of responses preferred a phone call for customer questions and 72.2% of responses preferred email.

[Cool Customer Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/2FOARrW)

The scenario, *I'm a customer with a problem (it's your responsibility to handle customer problems),* showed a surprising 61% preferring email and only 31.2% preferring a phone call.

## Consequences

We were also interested in understanding what impact these preferences have on the communication recipient. We set up a pair of questions in the survey to give respondents a chance to demonstrate the perceived consequences, both positive and negative. The negative consequences include, ""I mostly roll with it--no big deal"" (16.8%), ""I find it irritating and frustrating"" (24.3%), and ""The interruption negatively affects my work"" (16.5%), as well as, ""I may decide not to reply or continue communication"" (17.8%). The most damaging consequences would be ""I lose some respect for the person contacting me"" (7.3%), and ""I may block that person, or mark their contact as 'spam' or 'junk'"" (6.5%).

[Negative Consequences Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/RbL1A2Q)

Conversely, when the respondents' preferences were respected, there were positive consequences, including, ""It helps me manage my schedule"" (14.3%), ""I feel I'm more productive and efficient"" (13.9%), ""I believe I can dedicate the proper amount of attention to the communication"" (21.5%), ""I'm less irritated"" (20%), and ""It reduces my anxiety"" (18.8%).

# Conclusion

Our initial observations were that most people don't like receiving phone calls. Perhaps it's no mystery that the manner in which communication technology evolved puts the telephone front-and-center to business communication. However, our ongoing research shows that most people find phone calls to be disruptive and intrusive. Using the phone as a primary source of communication could be damaging to business relationships and to the overall economic health of our collective society. 

Looking at this research, we can see why ""cold calling"" feels ineffective and like ""a waste of time"" to many people. ""Cold emails"" are more likely to be effective and seem to have a lower downside. In fields like recruiting, it may be damaging for the hiring side of the relationship to initiate contact with a phone call. 

Yes, the research is ongoing, but it seems relatively clear that the phone should not be the first point of contact in any scenario, unless we know for certain that the recipient would prefer a phone call or we know for certain that the purpose of the contact is an emergency (the definition of ""emergency"" is somewhat subjective and needs to be judiciously applied). In business scenarios, the least risky option for contacting anyone is to use email and the most risky is to use alternative methods like MMS, or even IM. But, phone calls seem equally risky by the same standards considering that email seemed to dominate the responses.

As an illustration of the resistance to phone calls, this is a comment from the survey, ""I hate phone calls, almost unconditionally.  Texting or e-mails are always preferable unless it's really an emergency."" And, another comment, ""I do not generally like speaking on the phone because it's a purely auditory activity, and I am a visual person... I like time to process what's going on and formulate a response, otherwise I feel flustered and anxious."" These and several other comments are reflective of the overall tone of this survey. There were no equivalent comments showing resistance to email. 

Our research currently only analyzes the state of things as they are, not *why* things are as they are. For example, why are Boomers more resistant to phone calls than Millennials? Why are STEM-related occupations more resistant to phone calls than non-STEM-related fields? Why are extraverts as equally resistant to phone calls as introverts? What is the significance of gender in communication preference? How might this study be different if we focused on personal scenarios instead of business scenarios?

All of these questions push us to recommend further research in this area. We know that we are continuing to research this area, but our small contribution covers only a fraction of needed research.

We will begin ""Phase 2"" of this research soon. If you're interested in participating, keep a watch on our blog for updates. This topic will remain a topic of interest for The Movers &amp; Makers Company and our research is ongoing. If you are interested in this research or our other research, please [contact us](mailto:researchers@moversandmakers.xyz); but, please refrain from calling us on the phone, it's so disruptive.

isfj,"Trying one more time since I had to close the previous post. 

I know an ISFJ who is incredibly caring, attentive and has shown over time that I seem to receive different treatment than others judging by his actions. He has always been dependable, reliable and trustworthy as most ISFJ's seem to be. 

Are there any ""tells"" that differentiate how an ISFJ treats typical friends, close friends or someone they are romantically interested in?

I notice he is more open to affection with me, but at the same time deny any feeling related topic until he comes around to opening up a bit to me. 

Just last month he and my girl friend got me a birthday present, but he never said anything and played stupid even though I eventually found out he had a hand in the gifts.

Is there a way I can make him feel important, appreciated or special? It's his birthday coming up, but we're fairly anti-birthday so I hope I can come up with something. ",1491599266

I feel like I want to strive to be the absolute best, and I consciously know that is impossible for a normal guy like me, but deep down I can not acknowledge this fact, and my sensitivity introduced a whole array of negative emotions whenever my inferiority is proven.

I have this ISFJ friend that I have been best friends with for several years. I've noticed that she has been rather distant lately. I've also noted that she hasn't really made an effort to hang out with me. The times that I would reach out to her, via text, she would claim she hadn't read the message, even though the read receipts were on.

In the moments that I would hang out with her, it would seem like she didn't want to be there with me. She doesn't speak much, and when I ask her a question, she usually gives very short answers. I found this strange because she used to be very talkative around me.

I'm not sure what I did wrong to her, since I am always considerate to her feelings. Do any of you guys know why she is asking this way? What do you guys think of all this? Do you think she doesn't want to be friends with me anymore?",1491270023
isfj,"Hey all,
For most of my life, I classified as a ENFJ. I had one brief stint during a really low point in my life where I happened to take a test at a weekend retreat with friends and was typed ESFJ. I was very confused by it then. After I quit a bad job and got out of that low point I went back to ENFJ. Now three years later, my life looks very different. I am married, live in a different city than many of my friends, and am going into year three of working the same 2 jobs. My husband and I are trying to figure out how to stand on our own two (four) feet via buying a house and owning a dog. We also experienced a miscarriage about a year ago. We have mixed feelings about the experience but it has done two things: 1. Pushed us to buckle down and get our finances in order so we are more prepared when we are ready to try again and 2. Gave me the confidence to push for an IUD. I had previously been told no due to not having kids and being so young (eye roll). 

My question is this: Have you ever switched personalities after a life change? Going from single and in college to married and on our own has been a real eye opener. I retook the test last night out of curiosity and was not surprised to be typed so differently. I was never really a strong E, only a very strong J. 

I am also looking for more explanation of the S. When I was last typed an S, I was in a season of depression. I say season because I was not diagnosed but looking back I can see many of the signs. This makes me wonder if I am again in a season of depression, but that maybe it looks different than the one three years ago. 

Thanks so much.

isfj,"Help me /r/ISFJ, you're . . . a resource I haven't ~~exploited~~ mined for ideas yet.   Basically, I got a problem, and I'm hoping you wonderful people can help.

Here's the deal, my wife is an ISFJ (as you may have gathered by now).  *I* on the other hand, am an INTP.  You know, the emotionally barren, lost in their own thoughts all the time, so not noticing all the little amazing, incredible things their loving, nurturing spouse *does* for them constantly.
   
Now, to be fair, I've learned *a lot* over the years so I'm not (generally) as bad as the end of that previous paragraph might make me sound.  
   
That said, I want to be *better.*  
   
I want tricks and tips.  I want cheat codes.  I want ideas that will take her by surprise and make her *feel* appreciated more deeply than just words, or hugs, or flowers can.
    
This type of thing goes against my natural tendencies, but, knowing that she's so wonderfully *different* (coughbettercough) than I am, makes this particular little puzzle very, very interesting to me.
   
As you may guess, if you're prone to thinking along such lines, her ""love language"" is ""acts of service.""  I *kind of* understand this, at least in a theoretical aspect, but as a poster child INTP, I'm borderline *irrationally* independent, so it's a hard lens for me to view the world through for very long.  What she can view as sweet and helpful, I can see as kind of insulting and intrusive.  Sooooo, there's that.  It's a pretty stark contrast.
   
What that actually *means* is that I'm positive that I miss all kinds of little opportunities to help her out with things that she would appreciate, because they just don't occur to me.  If she's doing something, I just sort of assume that she's got it handled and that if she needs/wants help, she'll all for it.  Somehow,I feel like that's not the right perspective to have on this instance though.  So, what kind of signals do I look for to know when to jump in for the assist?
    
Beyond just trying to ""be helpful"" to her rather than being helped by her . . . what can I do?  Just expand on that same theme?  Declare a ""mom's weekend"" where I do all the cooking, cleaning, shopping, childcare,  petcare, etc.?  I'm up for that, but she's *horrible* at being bored.  And, since she's such a champ at taking care of other people all the time, she doesn't really have (or even really want?) any real hobbies or fun, time-wasting activities that she enjoys.  As impossible as it sounds (to my kind), helping other people out actually *recharges* her batteries.  WTH?!  How is that even fair to the rest of us?
    
I just feel like no little gesture I can make can ever be significant enough to show the gratitude she deserves for being the wife and mother that she is.  But I also find that conclusion unacceptable.
    
So, if it were *you*, and someone who loves you (but sometimes is pretty retarded about displaying it) wanted to just absolutely *melt* you . . . what could that lovable little retard do to sweep you off your feet?
   
*Any* ideas or suggestions you folks might have will be greatly appreciated.

I had a friend for almost four years and she was basically a sister to me and we had been living together for two years. Then a few months ago we started fighting and sat down to talk it all out. She basically told me she didn't want to be friends after we graduated college. That hurt me unbelievably bad. Since I was graduating a semester early I kind of slipped out of the friendship as quietly as possible. She texted me yesterday that she wants to hang out and be friends again and that she understands how hurtful she has been in the past (she has proven herself a bad friend on multiple occasions such as taking other people's sides against me, repeating confidential information I told her, and being incredibly cruel with things she has said to me in a very judgmental way).

I found out secondhand from a few of our friends today that he's been seeking advice from them, and after chatting to a few more of the friends that we share, it turns out that he's been asking all of them for advice except for me, and it's over some pretty personal matters.

I am kind of hurt by this, as we have always been best friends as children, and I always tell him about everything that's going on in my life but it feels like he has this humongous emotional wall up for me and exclusively me.

The biggest problem I learned that he's facing is his marriage is falling apart, but he's never so much as mentioned it to me even when I ask. According to our shared friends, he's been talking to them about it for months as well as some other big things happening in his life. I am quite upset about this because I always thought we were real close, but this kind of thing is happening more frequently lately where I will find out he's been having a problem in his life but he never brings it up to me, and I find out by accident or through other people. 

Is there any way to break down said emotional wall and get him to trust me? I don't think going up and simply asking how his marriage is going will give me much, and I want to get him to trust me enough to talk to me more. What's the cause of your emotional walls and boundaries, ISFJs? How do people break them down?
You would think since we are family and grew up really close to each other, and even more so that I tell him everything that we'd be the best of friends but it seems he's been keeping more from me than I ever knew, and I'm worried about his emotional health during this time.

isfj,"I need help trying to understand my ISFJ... okay so I'm an ENFP girl here trying to pursue an ISFJ male... we met through mutual friends and we instantly hit it off. It's so easy to talk to him and to open up to him. On my end, I feel a very strong and mental connection with him. The issue is, every time things are really good between us, he disappears. 

So we both have been talking on and off for the past 6 months now... the first time we talked, it was great. We both had so much fun getting to know one another, we'd stay up all night just talking to each other about ourselves, and the things in our lives, etc. After a few weeks of just talking we were already planning things far in the future, so of coarse I assumed that he liked me. He also confirmed that by telling me that he liked me a lot lol. So before rushing and jumping right into a relationship, we went on a date. We wanted to see how we interacted with each other in person. Our date went amazing. A few days after our date, he introduced me to some of his friends, and I even got to meet his brother. So in my head I thought things were going great! A week after going out, he starts to ignore me... which is very unlikely, because we just spent the last couple of weeks talking every single day. So I knew something was up.... he sent me a text later saying that he wanted to end things, because he felt like we were moving too fast. And he may have been right, but I felt okay to go along with it because things were really great between us. And keep in mind that he was the one planning future trips and stuff. Regardless he wanted to break things off, so we ended things. I was sad, but I never reached out to him again. About a month later, he comes back and tries to reconcile things... of course I'm a bit hesitant because he seemed like he had some issues due to his last relationship. A lot of trust issues, and commitment issues there. But eventually he won me over and we were back to where we had left off. I wanted things to be perfect this time around, so I tried to take things slower for him. So after a few weeks of just texting and communicating we decided to go on another date. The second date was just as good as the first one. I enjoy his company very much, and I feel like he does as well... a few days after our date he starts ignoring me again. So now I start to pick up on his pattern, and next thing you know he has me blocked on all his social medias. Even my phone number was blocked. I had no real way to reach him. He never gave me explanation as to why he left, he just did. So at this point I was emotionally invested in him because I felt like we had a real, genuine connection. I tried to move on and get over him, but I missed him. So one night I ended up getting drunk with a few friends, and I tried to message him on social media, and I guess my message actually went through. I told him that I had missed him, I wasn't expecting a reply. I just wanted to say it. He ended up messaging me back, saying that he had missed me too. Before we decided to try things again we talked about his behavior and why he kept leaving. He said that he is scared from his past relationship, he doesn't want to get hurt. So whenever things get really good, he freaks out and just wants nothing to do with me. Which is understandable, no one wants to get their heart broken. So after I thought I had earned a little trust from him, we decided to try things again for the 3rd time lol. I'm excited because I feel like this could be it, things could actually work out. A few weeks into talking things are going amazing. We hung out a few times, had a deep heart to heart conversation with each other about how we felt towards one another, which included the topic of how he can see himself falling in love with me, and how I could be ""the one"" and how he wants to build a future with me, etc! And then....He's back to ignoring me, and then leaving me with the excuse that he wants to end things because he thinks he's only attracted to me physically and that's it. 

So my question is.... is he bullshitting me because he's getting scared again? Or do I just need to accept the fact, that we are never going to work out. 


And he's not the asshole type, so no I don't feel like he was playing me. There were never any other girls involved. He might have been playing me emotionally, and I was too naive too tell, I can see that now. But I also feel like he's just freaked out again.

isfj,"I've never kept a todo list. I usually keep in mind the things I have to do through the day, although sometimes I get a bit anxious of forgetting about important things if I have to do any and so I start thinking about those all the time to make sure I don't forget.

I often think that having one would help me a lot, for example, apart from the everyday list, I could schedule those things I always say that I want to do but never actually get myself to do because I end up doing the same things every time out of laziness or because I don't want to escape my comfort zone.

Writing down something like a mind map would help me figure out what I want to do by indicating step by step how and when to do what.

isfj,"What's your strategy in getting yourself out of the slump when you KNOW you're being too hard on yourself?

Mine is making sure I distract myself and telling myself that it's all in my head and that what I'm thinking is probably not true.

**Example:** when I make a mistake which causes someone I care about to get upset, I tend to dwell on it and mope around a bit. But I try to snap out of it by being productive, going to the gym and basically, tell myself that I'm over thinking it (which works like 30% of the time but that's still something).

1) Can you really change types so easily? 
2) Or is this just having matured more?
3) I do enjoy being around some people; others exhaust me, and even if I've had a lot of fun, I *do* need some time to recharge. However, at the same time, I am extremely dependent on and *need* people. 
4) Isn't ISFJ considered the most 'extroverted' (I guess outgoing would be a better term) of the introverted types?
5) I agree more with ISFJ when I read up on it. 
6) My SO tells me he thinks I'm an 'extroverted riddled by anxiety'. And I'd slightly agree with that because I've been overcoming my anxiety a bit more and noticed that I am slightly more positive and outgoing.


A lot of these could type me as ambiverted; in fact, I am probably more ambiverted than anything. But does anyone have any thoughts/things to add on whether I am actually more introverted? ",1487537808

I'm a male ENFP, met this reaaaal cute looking ISFJ at a dance showcase. Walked up to her and straight up told her how she was the cutest looking at the whole event and how I'd love to add her on facebook (I noticed she got real shy and red, so I wanted to take it slow and not ask for her number yet).

Thing is, I would really love to get to know her better, (and admittedly get her to like me) and I would love your advice on this :)

I chat her up often and we always have long conversations, not really about deep stuff but just exchanging interests etc. and she seems like she kinda enjoys chatting.

My worry: I'm always the person to initiate. Is this an ISFJ thing or is this simply a sign she doesn't like me?

We met a 2nd time at a New Year's Event (1-2 weeks later) where she was dancing with her group. Instead of sitting with her dance members, she sat down next to me. I really fucked up hardcore and only cringed a few awkward conversations in there (REAL BAD. She felt awkward af tol and eventually sat somewhere else).

She DID say sorry afterwards and say she always need some time building trust with people, but I wonder:

Is just being nice and chatting with me out of courtesy or does she actuall enjoy the time chatting with me?

Uuuhm that was basically my question. I have a bad urge of wanting to know her better, open her up and making her laugh.

Question: why am I now apparently more introverted sensing than introverted intuiting? My mind is very foggy a lot of times and I find it hard to concentrate most of the time.

I definitely don't feel like the daughter she wanted.

I spend most of my time in my head and I will peak out at the world every now and then but everytime I do with her it's difficult. Being around her takes EXTREME amounts of work and effort. I love discussing things but she doesn't find the things I do interesting. She's not logical on ANY level but she always thinks she knows what she's talking about. She's very emotional and has our best interests at heart but it's so HARD to interact with her. She turns herself in circles with any sort of reasoning and I don't know where to begin. 

She doesn't know how to adapt a little to me and doesn't understand that she isn't adapting. She is just soaking up my energy. I always have to mirror her behavior to be around her. I don't want to always do that. Can't I be myself?

INTP here, and I feel increasingly frustrated by not knowing how to support her when she's frustrated.

Her: ""I'm so thirsty lately. I don't know why I'm so thirsty, but I hate being thirsty.""

Me: ""yeah, that sounds uncomfortable""

Now, this is where I think I'm making a mistake, but can't help it, because, in my head, I'm thinking, ""so go drink some water!"" But I know that's the *wrong* answer, and she's reaching out to me for emotional support, ... But if you would just drink the freaking water, we wouldn't be having this conversation, and your mouth wouldn't be dry!!

So invariably, I can't keep myself from saying, ""I know this is frustrating for you. What if I pick up some flavored water you like on the way home?"" 

This is where my head explodes and it feels like trying to lead a mule to water. I cannot talk her into an obvious solution! She won't do it won't do it won't do it. It will be something like, ""it's not the water. It's just that I'm so thirsty""

isfj,"Hey there! Hopefully I can get some thoughts on this.

I met this ISFJ online, about a month ago. We're both gay guys (probably doesn't matter). We're close in age. I live in the US and he lives in another country.

I've gotten to know him so well. We chat all day long, and we talk to each other almost once a day. We exchanged pictures and all that a little after we got to know each other. Throughout my time knowing him, I've gotten closer to him than I've gotten to anyone in my life. Even my best friend IRL that I've known for almost 10 years... I feel more comfortable and connected with this person online.

I asked him to take a personality test and he's an ISFJ. From my experience with him, he has a lot of deep feelings about me but I've always been the one that has had to show interest. I've always had to show him how I feel before he shows me how he feels. When I finally brought the conversation up with him, he told me he loved me, and since I have deep feelings for him too, I agreed to date him and eventually meet within a year or so.

My question is, is it normal for someone with this personality to develop such deep feelings so fast? And why did he say he loves me so soon? Or is it not too soon?",1484613237

isfj,"So for many years I've learned to distrust reacting on my emotions right away and also became very practiced in how I express myself in order to be understood and make arguments so that they are effective. it's a skill i built up in dealing with my emotionally abusive and narcissistic parents. 

If someone were to say something mean or something that upsets me, I would digest their words to figure out why it was said or what was the real meaning of it. then i'd go over in my head what about it i don't like and then how to talk to the person so that they can understand what i don't like about it, that the thing i don't like makes sense, and why it would be beneficial for them and to those around them if this person were to alter how they act in similar circumstances.

and i can do this through high stress situations. but i don't show it on my face, in my body language, or my tone. i don't want to escalate the situation, and i want to be at maximum persuasion for a long term effect, and the best way i find to do so is through a calm demeanor and through making simple points, and kind of stroking a person's ego a bit on whatever their strongest positive trait is, and basing my argument around that trait and that perspective. and it's kind of stupidly martyristic of me to always be doing this i guess. i'm very ends-over-means and take-the-high-road about it.

but it comes with a draw back in that it takes a lot of effort for me to do that. it sucks the emotional energy right out of me. and also, when i do it, it requires me to show calm, even when i'm not, even if my heart is racing and i just want to yell at the person. and this ended up being a problem with my ex girlfriend. even if i said i disliked something, it was hard for her to really comprehend how much it was a problem for me because i did not show it in my expressions or tone, only my words.

i don't even know what i'm trying to get out of writing this. advice? understanding? something. i just know there is a problem and it's not quite concrete to me yet what it's exact nature is so i currently can't even try to find a solution.",1484579474

isfj,"I (ENFP) haven't really ever had problems with my mom. Growing up, she was always emotionally supportive of all of her kids, she never pressured us to try anything, she always knew how we felt, and she always knew what to say. Basically you could insert any cliched good-mom adjective and she was that. Since starting college, though, I can't stand to be around her. Anytime I get into a conversation with her, even about the most casual of topics, the way she communicates completely stifles any sort prior excitement I had about talking about it. She just sort of sucks the energy right out of me. It's exhausting.

So here's some backstory: growing up, she would often say that she felt her one true purpose on Earth was to be a mom. She's also a nurse, and to add to that, we always had a ridiculous assortment of pets at my house (e.g. dogs, cats, horses, birds, rats, hamsters, ferrets, skunks... the list goes on). Basically, she's an ISFJ caregiver at heart.

Here's the catch:

Throughout her life, she's had a string of bad relationships. My alcoholic dad cheated on her twice until she left him, she started dating another alcoholic (who actually treated her alright, but hated my older sister) and shortly broke up with him. Since 2011, she's been in a relationship with arguably the worst of the worst: a controlling, suicidal alcoholic who is fifteen years younger than her. Their relationship has been absolutely toxic; he has threatened to kill himself multiple times if she leaves him and he even put a tracker in her phone without her knowing so that he could see everything she did/everywhere she went. Totally insane, I know.

Anyway, all us kids hate him. He's unintelligent, fake, and just outright awful. But she's stayed with him because of her insecure attachments, low self-esteem, and fear of loneliness. It's truly a bummer. She deserves so much better.

Anyway, after my twin brother (also ENFP) and I left for college, she officially turned into an empty-nester. I think this must have been traumatic for her because she sort of went off the deep end a little bit. She stopped calling us, was super emotional and vulnerable anytime we tried to talk, and was overtly resentful of us for not ""appreciating her"".

Subsequently, I've started resenting her, too. It's not really anything I can help her with, either; I feel like she just doesn't understand me anymore. For example, I'll bring up a topic (say, open relationships) and I'll try to spark up an interesting conversation with her about it. What inevitably ends up happening, though, is that she assumes that I'm in an open relationship and then freaks out and questions my sense of morality and her own parenting. It's so frustrating. Literally, one time I told her I was OK with smoking weed, and she cried. And I never know what to do in those instances.

It goes deeper than this, too. What sparked this post was our conversation about sex (we're pretty open about that stuff) and she just went off about how my dad cheated on her and how he messed her up permanently, etc. This sort of self-victimizing behavior happens ALL the time, and once it starts, it just sort of spirals out of control. She'll stop listening to any logical input I have about the situation and quickly assume everything I tell her stems from the self-imposed belief that everyone thinks she's worthless and nobody cares about her. Even when I'll literally say, ""We all love you, nobody thinks that, you're being unfair to yourself,"" she'll interpret that as me saying ""you're crazy and delusional.""

Basically I need some help in how to communicate so that she'll feel validated. She won't listen to anything I say, she won't go to therapy (even when we've talked about how transformative it can be), and she spins anything my siblings and I say into this negative, self-deprecating idea of herself. All of us siblings are super open with each other, emotionally stable and intelligent, and get along great. We love open discussions about a bunch of different topics (all N's) and we have the same sense of humor. And we all have talked about how our mom has gotten to the point that we can't even have a normal conversation with her without being on our toes the entire time.

I just want to be able to have uninhibited conversations with my mom again, so if anyone could offer some advice or even just some reassuring words, that'd be great.

tl;dr: My ISFJ mom goes on shame spirals when I talk to her and I need help validating her while simultaneously feeling like I'm authentically communicating my ideas to her.",1483074484

isfj,"Hi, I know few of you guys yet you guys are one of my favourites.

I find an issue is that my close ISFJ friends don't continue conversations with me, especially if they are too philosophical or heavy. Not implying that they are unintelligent, because they are very intelligent, but rather, I think they find it irrelevant or too touchy.

They enjoy small talk ‚Äî knowing about my life or the lives of the people around me, even if they don't know them.

Questions I have are:

* Do you zone out because those topics are boring to you? 

* How do you like someone to carry a conversation?

* Why are you reserved even with your most loved one? How can your partner ease you into opening up?

isfj,"Hi, fellow ISFJ here. I have recently met a girl, and after a couple of dates I would place her as an ISFJ too. She seems very nice and I am interested in giving it a chance, although I am a bit concerned with both of us leaning towards Introverted. (My score was about 55% Introvert). 

Does anyone have any experience or thoughts about this? Will it be a problem with both of us wanting the other to depend on the other, can it get ""quiet"" when both are social, but lack the natural conversations that are typical for extroverts. Or do you think it can be a peaceful and fulfilling relationship?

isfj,"Hello ISFJs :) While I'm not an ISFJ myself, my SO was, however recently broke up with me, and I have a few questions to ask, hopefully to help my own understanding of his actions, I hope this is okay :)


Background info: ISFJ SO of 3yrs broke up with me completely out of the blue last week, shocking literally everyone (me, our parents, friends, etc). We were in a long distance relationship, with a set date of when we'd be back together for good, however it was really serious (only a couple of weeks ago we were talking about wedding details, picked out a date, planning engagement). In the couple weeks before he broke up with me, he was acting more distant than usual, which put me on edge, but I chalked up to him feeling a bit stressed or being busy, which I understand (life happens), and just tried to keep showing him that I cared about him. 

Finally I asked him if he even loved me, and he calls me and tells me he wants to ""take a break"" until he can see me in person, and we'll go from there. He said he'd been considering this for ""a couple of weeks"", which is a really short time in my mind. No mention of fixing things, and when I asked if i did anything wrong/could improve in any way, he said I was perfect and it was all him (super confusing to me, and not helpful at all!). 


One other thing to complicate things further is that he mentioned he wants to move away from our home country, and live/work overseas (where he is currently situated), and he didn't think that would work with my plan, however this is something that I am not fully against. I feel like this won't be practical for him, due to student debt/lack of funds/low demand job/no sponser him/etc. I'm not sure whether he has figured this out for himself or not though (gut feeling is no). For this reason, I feel like (but could be totally wrong), that when he comes back, at some point, he is going to realise he made a mistake, and ask me back. I do realise that this is being ridiculously hopeful on my behalf, although I'm not completely sure if I want him back though yet as well.


He still has me on all socials, however hasn't contacted me since/interacted with me at all, and has deleted most pictures of us together online (so have I though). I still really like him, I don't think he's a bad person (yet), and I think there's a chance that we could make it work, but I just don't know where I/we went wrong! The last thing I told him was that I loved him, and then hung up, then no contact - not sure whether a nice message would hurt or help in this situation, but I also don't want to be the the first one to speak after he broke up with me! 

Any perspectives from an ISFJ point of view would be super appreciated!


I also have just some general questions, if anyone could answer, this would be fantastic too!

* Have you ever gotten back together with someone you broke up with? 
* Are you more likely to tell your ex the truth about why you broke up with them, or not? Why/why not?
* Do you still think about someone you broke up with?
* How long do you usually take to make a major decision (like breaking up with someone)?
* Would you be more likely to get back together with someone if they contacted you?

isfj,"Hello all! My wife and I have been happily married for years, we're not on the verge of a breakup, totally committed to one another, all that jazz. While we've accepted and even appreciate each others' differences, there's one area I've been quite curious about lately, it's probably no surprise that that area is sexual intimacy.

As an ENFJ, I have no problem discussing things without shame, whereas my ISFJ (we both recently took numerous personality tests that produced the same results) wife is way less inclined to be so frank about certain things, especially sex. I'm totally cool with and have even come to view it as kind of sexy. 

Again, no real problems in the sex department, but we've together for awhile and, not wanting things to get boring (maybe the won't for her), I've been thinking of how to add more spice to the bedroom. You see, she's hugely schedule oriented and predictable, which means we make love 1-2 times per week, usually Thursday night and once over the weekend, once the kids are in bed. It's sort of cute, actually, I can tell it's going to happen when she puts on a TV show neither of us are really interested in watching.

The only problem, small as it is, has to do initiating sex...

Outside of those 2 nights, any playful sexual behavior of mine (butt grab, long neck kiss, lil boob rub, pulling her crotch close to mine in the kitchen when the kids aren't around an whispering something sexy in her ear... ahem) is usually met with either an eyeroll or, less frequently, her saying something like, ""It's like you can't get enough."" To which I respectfully respond, ""With a wife as sexy as you, there's no such thing as enough."" Maybe once per year this will turn into a minor argument, but all in all, we just move on and I wait until Thursday or Sunday night.

What I've failed to acknowledge in the ~20 years we've been together is the fact *my approach* may not jibe with hers, that my overt attempts at initiating sex don't register with her. That's why I'm here, to ask:

What gets you going? What is it you find attractive about your partner? What can I do differently to send her the message that I'm interested in physical intimacy without annoying her? I'm willing to accept that there's really nothing that can be done, and that's fine since we are happily married, but if there is something, I'm curious what it is! 

And just to be clear, I'm not seeking methods for covertly manipulating my wife, we talk about this stuff and I definitely plan to let her know I looked into things - she actually finds this an appealing thing about me. 

Thank you!",1482337145

So Im definately a hugger. I always try to get as close as possible to people I care about, but then I am constantly over-analyzing and wondering if I am making them uncomfortable. I have this deep desire, almost hunger, for someone to prove they care about me through a hug or something similar, but normally Im the one who has to initiate things if I need support. As a guy, its especially hard becuase they way Iact or wish others acted are not seen as masculin, and this plays in the with overanalyzing. I would love nothing more than to just relax with a friend and snuggle in a platonic way, but nobkdy really does this.  
All of these factors cause me to be kinda clingy with people, which can push them away and this has really cut my confidence down. Its definately gotten better as I have learned where the line is, but I still have a need for closeness in a non romantic way.

isfj,"This post is mostly just getting things off my chest because I'm too afraid to say them out loud. I don't know if this will get feedback but any is appreciated.

For the past few months I've been in a relationship with the greatest person in the world. She honestly means everything to me. I could be in the shittiest mood and she'd lift me up in an instant without even trying. Our relationship has been scaring me though. It took me a while to realize that she's just a naturally shy and somewhat distant person, so many times I mistook these things for rejection and I hate myself for wasting so much time and energy dwelling on the fear. But it's still not going away.


I know it's hard for her to express her emotions a lot of the time so I've tried getting used to being the only one that says things like ""I love you"" but she expresses her feelings in other ways. I know that she'll always be like this and I don't necessarily have a problem with it, but the behavior scares me a ton. I've done a lot of research about ISFJs and I know that one thing that I should always do is remind her that I'm always there for her and that I love her but I constantly confuse her distant behavior as rejection and her being older than me and being busy with school and friends a lot of the time doesn't help.


I want to tell her I love her, all the time I do. She means the absolute world to me, I honestly don't think I'd be alive at this point without her coming into my life so suddenly. I appreciate all she does and I want to be there for her whenever and however I can but this shadow of doubt is fucking crushing me. I can feel the words stirring in my chest and I want to let them out, I want to let her know but something in my mind always bites at me when I'm about to. It's not because my feelings for her are false, it's more like I feel like it wouldn't actually matter to her if I told her. I feel like my expression of love would just be another burden for her to bear. 


I think the problem is that she's too good for me. She's insanely talented, smart, funny, gorgeous and it fucks with my head because I can't understand why she's with someone like me. I've told her before that she deserves someone way better but she hates hearing things like that. I know that should reassure me but my thoughts are still killing me more and more, day after day.


My love for her means everything to me. She's the only reason I even find myself getting out of bed in the morning. I wouldn't try this hard for anyone else, let alone myself but I still find myself pushing harder and harder to become better for her because even though she doesn't do it outright, she inspires me to become a better person. I want to be better, for her sake. I want to tell her so badly but the fear chews me up. I'm a very doubtful person in general but I've never second guessed my love for her.

I define myself a lot by what I bring to others. I'm not as close with my friends as I used to be, but that's just everyone being busy with their lives, so I naturally want to get closer to someone and I'm asking myself: do I want another relationship just to quickly feel better? Should I take more time alone to learn to like myself better?

I'm doing fine with my life otherwise: good job, doing my master degree, exercising, eating well, etc... But that's daily routine, it doesn't make me happy or unhappy, it's just there to keep me busy.

Personally, I generally like touch. Handshakes, hugs, and pats from strangers don't strike any particular chord in me. The closer I am to the person, the more inclined I am to appreciate touch. Hugs are a solid choice. High-fives, fist-bumps, and secret handshakes make me feel closer to the person as well. I like having physical contact with introverts and extroverts though I appreciate introverts slightly more as it seems like they are more comfortable with you. 

Giving: When I see people down or sad, I use hugs and shoulder holds as a sign of caregiving(more with friends rather than strangers). If I know they don't like touch then I look for other outlets, but touch is a common default.

Receiving: When I'm emotionally exhausted or down, I long for someone to initiate touch and ideally I'd like for them to embrace me in a long hug or just let me have some sort of contact with them(head on lap, backside resting against them, etc.).

isfj,"Hi guys!

I'm an ENFP, who for the last month has been talking to an ISFJ! He's lovely, and so different than what I'm used to. But we have very different ways of going about things... I rush into love.... he wants to take time and get to know me. Completely understandable, and exactly what I need (though it did take me a bit of research on this forum to not feel rejected by that suggestion) But anyway. He, about 8 months ago, got out of a long 3 year relationship with his first love. She treated him very badly, and he has the mental scarring to prove it. I can tell, even though he rarely speaks of it, that he's entirely scared of getting hurt again. It's also very hard for him to let me in, even though I make him happy. 

Side note: I also think he's compeletly scared of my way of life. I'm sporadic, he's not. He's shy, I'll talk to anyone. I love travel and adventure, he's never left the west coast. We are polar opposites when it comes to the way we live, express things, and talk about life. But it's surprisingly intriguing (at least, for me.) he makes me feel safe, and calm. 

We live two hours away from one another, due to work, and he works very intense hours, often times the night shift, so texting for us is very on and off. (Also, how are you lot as texters? When you like someone? He's pretty awful, haha) but anyway, I went up to visit him and we had such a wonderful time. I cracked through his walls a bit. We held hands, kissed, slept next to one another, and it was so comforting. He really seemed like he liked me. Making him laugh was my favorite part. 

But after I left, things changed. Now I feel he was just acting that way as to not hurt my feelings. We texted for a few weeks... and I know his job crazy, but he seemed to be starting to pull away. I'm taking this as a sign that he's not ready to open his heart to anyone. I get that, I've been hurt before. But it hurts feeling like I'm not enough, and never will be.

Am I overthinking, or is this a sign that we should part ways? 

He's coming home to visit his family (they live near me) in a week, and a few weeks ago had asked me if I wanted to do something while he was home, and of course I said yes, but right now he just seems too distant. I don't want to get hurt either. 

What do I do? Help!!!",1476823256
isfj,"I have a lovely friend who is an ISFJ. She's there for me when I need someone, and she's not afraid to talk about the dark sides of life. She respects my silence when I'm thinking and contemplating. I feel like she understands me and doesn't at the same time. As someone who longs for a connection, I love having her around because she cares outwardly. I see it when she's nervous. I see it when we talk. I see it when she leans a bit closer than usual when we're working on something together (totally platonic) because that's how she says, ""I feel safe around you"". Also, I just realized that I need more friends who are girls (I'm a dude). Anyway, you guys are great.",1476809818

I've always been the pursuer, and the more verbally expressive one. I really want to make it a comfortable experience for him, and I don't expect anything back.

isfj,"Hi, I am an ISFJ but I need help in learning more about certain things about myself that kind of bug me. I need advice in how to handle several situations or to know what to do to change my personality.

First of all, I've noticed that when I am in a group, I tend to feed from the energy and feedback from others when it comes to our interaction. If someone is not interested in our conversation, I feel like I am not interesting. On the other side, if someone is open to me and wants to talk to me, I feel so happy and it can literally make my day. If someone ask for my advice, it's even better. Second of all, I also worry about what I say mainly to avoid conflict or to avoid sounding silly. Consequently, I feel more pessimist about life because most of the time, reactions I get from people is not what I expect.

Truthfully, I just want to be neutral about these things. I don't want others to affect the way I feel about myself. Is this possible? Thanks for taking the time to read and to answer :)

isfj,"So I have been called both of these things recently by the same person, apparently ISFJs are known to be good at both, there is a difference one has negative connotations and is seen as a character flaw while the other positive and is welcomed, so I guess my question is are you aware when you are doing any of these and how to motivate others without it being interrupted as being manipulative?  

Manipulation is thinking of a reason others will want to do something, and then convincing them of your correctness.

Motivation is genuinely seeking out the wants, needs, and desires of the other party, and then working with the other party to find solutions that meet your needs - and theirs.

isfj,"Just a little curious.  My sister is an ISFJ and struggles deeply with getting over her childhood.  Her childhood wasn't even that bad!  She's a successful adult now but struggles in her personal life and blames my dad (INTJ) He was a bit hard on her but only because he wanted her to be successful.

Her grudge hurts her relationship with him and they don't see eye to eye.  She also struggles with a bad boyfriend relationship that went down in flames.  She carries that baggage when she dates and it makes it hard for her to open up or let go emotionally.  

Is this a common theme for you guys?  How do you overcome it?",1475695964

My roommate tries to get away with so much when it comes to me. I've put my foot down a couple of times, but she still tries to get away with stealing food, making a mess of my things in the bathroom, etc. I don't really say anything because I'm afraid of people getting mad at me. I'm 26/F and wish I could be more assertive, but since I have very little friends in the first place and want to live in a place where there's no conflict, I don't know what to do. I also pay more in rent than she does because she said she couldn't afford the rent anymore and I'd rather just not have to deal with looking for a new room mate since I'm already busy as fuck. We just signed a year lease and I can't believe I'm already sick of her...

Any other ISFJs overcome this? I'm a dead-on mix between ISFJ/ISFP.",1475128635

isfj,"So I've had an insecurity where I'm aware I'm a very quiet person even among friends. It's not that I don't have anything to say it's the stuff I want to say I either feel is: I'm not knowledgeable enough on subject to say something, someone has already said something I would have said, what I want to say not relevant to conversation, if I say the wrong thing I'll get people angry.  

Even when it comes to just talking about what I've been up to I get super conservative about talking about myself. Just don't want to bore/annoy people with my life since a lot of stuff I like isn't stuff a lot of my friends either don't know about or don't like.
