ESFJ,"Most of the community is early 20s and teens, so sometimes that question can come off creepy.

At 33 your type is set in stone and should have developed your first three functions well enough to identify them. I would seriously doubt with what you've described in this thread you're an ESFJ.",1617446984
ESFJ,"I am turning 33 this year. No worries, age is just a number :)",1617436357

ESFJ,"There's very little in difference with the ExFJ, other than the aux and tert functions. I'd say ENFJ may be better at socially maneuvering than ESFJ, solely because of that aux Ni. Ni is more flexible than Si, and ENFJ use it in tandem with the dom Fe to read between the lines of every social interaction. While we are both very socially charismatic, the way we use that charisma is different:

Fe-Si likes to stand back and feel out the other parties first, then becomes a social chameleon based on the information given. It becomes even stronger when that tert Ne gets strengthened.

Fe-Ni goes all in, especially when the tert Se is involved. I've seen it described almost like the charisma a cult leader would have: incredibly intuitive and *very* good with on the spot reading of others. However used incorrectly and it can be extremely manipulative.

Personally I have four ENFJs in my life, three I'm quite close to. Luckily they're all wonderful people and extremely charming motherfuckers.",1617434081
ESFJ,"ESFJ is FeSi, NeFi is ENFP. If ESFJ is more accurate, go with it. You do use all of your functions to live, FeSi are just your natural ones",1617434053
ESFJ,"Oh thank you! Love the assessment!
I got FeSi.
But I had serious doubts about whether ""personal relationships"" or ""what if"" fits me best. When I did a 2nd assessment and went for ""what if"", then I ended up with NeFi. 😂",1617433765
ESFJ,Nice analysis. Do you have any insight on the difference between ENFJ and ESFJ? I feel like I'm not good as sensing or intuition. I've been told I use my Se a lot so maybe I'm just too busy having fun haha.,1617433143
ESFJ,go here and tell me what you get [https://www.typeinmind.com](https://www.typeinmind.com),1617432775
ESFJ,"I think ""tradition"" is translated incorrectly in the MBTI community. At least for me its not about social tradition, but instead the continuation of what has proven to make me happy and accepted by the ones I love. Its less about society and more about who I value the most. (See: Fe-Si)

Loyalty means everything to me. I have been in the same job for going on 13 years, and happily married to a fantastic ISTJ for almost a decade. Changing jobs is very unappealing and leaving or cheating on my spouse is an absolute no go, because I value that security and peace they bring me. 

At the core ESFJ value security and a firm foundation, even if its a bit repetitive or ""boring"" to others. It may seem so to others but to us it is a thrill knowing we have something to stand on that we know will not cause us to slip. ENFP are Ne dom, which values ""new"" and ""innovative"" the highest. Si is your inferior function which means its your weakest, so its not surprising you don't like to stay in one spot long.

By the way you describe yourself I would be hardpressed to say you're ESFJ at all.",1617432061

ESFJ,I like how you just warned for the length of the thread a priori.,1617322055
ESFJ,"Yeah i think it's definitely our default to say yes to things. If we say no to what the other person needs or wants, they may feel bad or dislike us. So we want to say yes and sacrifice our own want or need. This can build up resentment over time because now you're not ever getting what you want and may get tired of always having to put others first.

What I learned is that people aren't asking me to always put them first. I can't read someone's mind to anticipate what they want. I can't just assume that this person won't be flexible. The best way is to just be open with communication. Both people just say what they want. Do you want the same thing? If not, you can talk it out. In a healthy relationship, the other person shouldn't attack you for wanting a certain thing. And saying what you want doesn't mean you are stating your way must be done. You're still in the talking phase, and haven't moved to the decision phase yet. If you're in a hard disagreement, it becomes trickier. But hopefully both sides can listen to each other and find compromise that both people are okay with. Not just saying they're okay with it for the sake of avoiding conflict. Be honest about what you mean and feel.",1617299761

ESFJ,"&gt; No, he would maneuver the conversation, and pretty much social engineer me, until I had talked myself out of it. Then, he would say we could do this other thing instead (going to the live music). 
&gt; I was so shocked by this, to be honest, it just sounds so toxic! 

Pretty much every FJ I ve met does that on a regular basis. NFJs being especially good at it.

&gt; Learn to communicate your feelings, needs and wants

SFJs spend their time thinking about what other people want. It sounds weird to them that this needs any communication.

First of all, Rick is definitely an ESFJ because his behaviours reflect Fe hero very well. I also struggle with the exact same problems. 

Second, it is so true that we are indirect about our needs and wants. This is unhealthy in a long run, I totally agree with you that learning how to be direct and confrontational will improve our relationships so much more!

Rick is such a great example of someone who never stops improving! And having a partner like you definitely empowers him even more!

Thank you for sharing your advice with us!!!! I’m beyond grateful for your insights!!!!",1617242067

ESFJ,"I posted a kinda long post from feedback from my ESFJ conversation :) 


But as far as how he manages his need for socialization, he is still struggling with it. When he was younger, he moved from a small town to a medium-sized city with enough things to do/things to see and more opportunities for meeting people. But things presently are not ideal obviously - places are not quite all open where we live, and not everyone being vaccinated also limits things. 


However, every time he sees his therapist, he says he feels so much better about things and it helps so much! I'm thinking it's part ""hanging on"" knowing it will be over eventually (hopefully soon); having a small pod of good friends, who consistently Zoom (check-ins every 2 weeks over zoom, and small in-person gathering once/twice a month at home); and therapy. He also joined online local groups (Nextdoor, MeetUp) for online meets/happy hours. Not ideal but it's getting him through.",1617236925

Only games I'm super super into will I invest the time he does into all his games like Yakuza or something (which isn't even an RPG lmao.

I often think of my ESFJ partner in a good way, and feel so happy and thankful to have him. But for some reason, I don't pick up the phone and tell him.  Maybe texting seems impersonal... or feelings are complex and deep, and words just aren't good enough to convey everything! 

I'm sure he thinks about you much more often than you realize!",1617127992

ESFJ,"I'm an INFJ f in a relationship with a ESFJ m, both early 40's. I think it's going great!  But in truth, it's because we've both had years of either therapy or done deep self-work. 

I'm no ESFJ expert but I read that the ESFJ likes to take their socially ""traditional"" role. I've read your combo female ESFJ with male INFJ is difficult. I think that's because INFJ is passive, go-with-the-flow; and the ESFJ will also be passive/follower. Both will expect the male INFJ to initiate things, all the time.

ESFJ's will need frequent feedback and reassurance which will not come easy to the INFJ. Or they may give lip service/flatter which will come off as fake/shallow to the intuitive INFJ. 

However, if both are willing to admit to their shortcomings and start REAL self-care (individual therapy or work on relationship communication) I think it's seriously a great match long-term. 

I feel very cared for by my ESFJ and appreciate how willing he is to learn my weird INFJ mind. We have a lot in common now!  However, it's also obviously clear that if we had met when we were young... we were both such a hot mess, that we would have been horrible to each other.",1617115484

The extroverted ones are quick and wild and more likely to consider a lot more possibilities, while the introverted ones limit themselves to specific pieces of the information, in whatever form they may be. This allows them to come up with stronger deeper connections based on a small bit of information. Here's how an ENTJ explained it to me. Consider a tree by the side of a lake. Now, the tree is leaning over the lake and it's the start of the rainy season. Ne will think about how different birds might sit on the branches or how it will feel to sit in a little boat on the lake, under the overhanging branches, but Ni will instantly think about the fact that the rain is going to weaken the soil enough for the tree to fall into the lake. An Ni user will not look at the multitude of possibilities, but instead just what's important. I'm sure you've noticed the same with Si. You might be more likely to remember specific details about something that you felt were important and disregard the unnecessary details. An Se user might pay attention to all those details however.

ESFJ,"Abstract would be anything that goes beyond real objects or real things perceptible by your senses, I'd say. Like, for example, a conversation about MBTI or theories of that kind. Or theorising about made up scenarios that are not real, or trying to understand the implications about things.

A real life example that came to my mind. The other day I was with 2 friends. One of them was an INTP (abstract) and the other one was an ESFJ (concrete). I am an INFP (abstract). So, we started talking about the evolution of mankind, and how certain aspects of our species evolved the way they evolved (for example, why we have two eyes, why our nose has the shape it has, etc). My INTP friend and I were all into that, we were enjoying our conversation, but we noticed that our ESFJ friend was getting really bored of that conversation, because of its lack of ""concreteness"".

And as for what is ""long"", I don't know... An extended conversation. Maybe 10-20 minutes would be enough for a concrete person to get bored from an abstract topic, I don't really know. It depends I guess...",1615678981
ESFJ,What do you consider abstract and what is long?,1615669997

Although we are two very different people, our relationship works because both of us are very understanding and open minded.

ESFJ,"&gt; The thing is we predict where shit goes wrong and literally make this massive Te system weighing all the probabilities of shit happening.

When I try to do that, I find a dire lack of information which means my guesses end up often wrong. (but often right too)

Example : I believed that my friend's business wouldnt fail (Economical conjoncture suitable for it, natural qualities that favored it, although it wasnt that solid and well structured)
But a revolution happened in that country and my friend's business was crushed by it.

Example 2 : The same friend was on road to fail a project. Then miraculosly, he met the exact right person at the exact right time and they helped him out and things worked out. 

Every time I had difficulties predicting an outcome because there were information that I couldnt predict or give accurate likelihoods to.

&gt;  Not only are we usually right, but pur lack of caring for other people we'll literally watch people fail just to have the ""I told you do moment"". 

That's your Fe trickster. An Fe person, when concluding that someone is going to fail will do their best to manipulate/convince them into doing what's good for them. 

Although you might blame them for that, remember that Fe places the morality of the result far above the morality of the process.

&gt; This is literally our process for publication. We co-write everything but she fucking sucks at organizing LMAO. She writes like Jung, nothing makes sense with Ne hahaha.

Lmao, I would advise her to be less impatient and to take the time to do things properly. I remember often failing assignments as a student because I wanted to do things quickly/in a fun way, when the best way to make things as clear as possible was to take the time and improve details. By carefully selecting what information to put in it and arraging the associated details properly, it will become clear !

I am happy for you man ! You seem very happy being with her ! :D

&gt;  Where I'll listen to all her gathered Ne/Ti, organize it all and create a plan with my Ni/Te. I'll then gather real data with my Se and she'll organize the data with her Si.

That's great man ! I ve always asked people to help me organized my gathered ""plans"" to create one.
It's very rare that people are willing to do that lmao, she is lucky to have you !

&gt; Just remember, introverted functions beat out extroverted functions. She listens to my Ni and I listen to her Ti. 

I ve noticed that ! But introverted functions are far more boring x)

&gt; Just remember, introverted functions beat out extroverted functions. She listens to my Ni and I listen to her Ti. We work extremely well together haha. Wouldn't trade her for the world even when she's stubborn hahahaha.

My ESFJ best friend is always mind blown when I guess shit like years in the future and he'll ask me ""how did you guess that"" and I'll point out all these super tiny minor shit and add them all up into this guess. Ni is kinda like a mind reader in that way.

Whenever guessing is involved my ESFJ friend will call me and be like ""what would you do?"" And to make sure he's using his Ne/Ti I won't respond until he walks me through his solution to the problem. 1. It makes him guess more which he needs to do 2. I don't come off at criticizing but rather giving suggestions. 3. My Te can make a practical plan to fix the situation that works for everyone.

He's was better at guessing now hahahaha. But I totally get it! I hate looking at the facts. He literally holds my hand to do Si hahahahaha. It's kinda embarrassing but we benefit each other. We call each other out for either needing to guess or check the facts. We share no functions so we save each other daily. I very much appreciate the Fe/Si hahaha.",1615612097
ESFJ,"The thing is we predict where shit goes wrong and literally make this massive Te system weighing all the probabilities of shit happening.

I especially find my Ni is way more precise than most INTJs because I teach formal logic to university students and LSAT prep. So not only is Ni naturally doing this I will literally sit there working out deductive, inductive, abductive, etc logical exercises to ""verify"" my own predictions.

And being an INTJ. Not only are we usually right, but pur lack of caring for other people we'll literally watch people fail just to have the ""I told you do moment"". My ENTP gf and I have worked out a system. Where I'll listen to all her gathered Ne/Ti, organize it all and create a plan with my Ni/Te. I'll then gather real data with my Se and she'll organize the data with her Si.

This is literally our process for publication. We co-write everything but she fucking sucks at organizing LMAO. She writes like Jung, nothing makes sense with Ne hahaha.

We work in a similar field (she's a Psychologist I'm a Philosophical Counselor/formal logic professor) so when we were doing our degrees. She was doing research on a really cool topic and I was one of her first experiences with an Ni hero person. She poured half a year into her research, with her Si being so low she literally can't organize shit to save her life. I offered her tips from Ni which she completely ignored me and I flat out told her no one will publish her research (Ni already looked way in the future). Her research topic was great but her ability to put shit together was so trash no journal would accept that. She didn't believe me so I let her fail. She tried to publish the research for 2 full years rejection after rejection. She was running out of journals to submit it to.

Eventually she has a massive Fi trickster break down and finally let out of her pride and asked me for help. I completely reorganized the study in about a week (Te works hard man) she didn't even recognize her own work when I was done with it. The research was published 6 months later and that's when she asked me out lmao.

She was humbled HARD by Ni/Te. But that's why INTJs are ENTPs ideal match. We over asses in all areas you can't do and you guys cover our asses in all areas we can't do.

That research study was probably our biggest fight ever. But as an INTJ, I'd rather let reality humble an ENTP than me force them to listen to me.

She respects Ni a lot more now and when she doesn't I let her suffer the consequences. The most annoying part is when it doesn't work out she'll get super annoyed her Ne failed her.

ESFJ,thank you for your answer!,1615578519
ESFJ,"Female INTJ here with male ESFJ best friend. Yes, 100%. Sometimes they don't even see it themselves because of the lack of Se.

Mt best friend is an ESFJ. I knew he liked me when he started getting really nervous around me and started doing really extravagant things for me. He recently confused to me and he's still nervous around me despite me already knowing.

Personally I think it's really cute. We hang out every weekend together and eventually you get used to it.

But the best way to tell if they're comfortable with you is when they start using Ne. It sounds really weird but they have Ti last so they're generally insecure about their own thinking. And being an EXXJ, their core insecurity is about other people.

I learned pretty quickly (thank you Ni) that he felt loved through words of affirmation so I reassured him a lot, complicated the things he did well, and approached mistakes from an nurturing perspective.

Because the N is lower their ideas will likely be less developed than someone with N higher up (unless they're Fe/Ne dom but I find most ESFJs are Fe/Si dom) so even tho you may see their ideas as under developed, respecting their thoughts and teaching them for to 1. Organize them (use your Ni) and 2. Make a practical plan to achieve the goal (Te) has been the best method I've personally found to build a good connection with them.

In order for a type to get their shit together they need to develop the opposite function of their last function (for INTJs it's Si and for ESFJs it's Te). Essentially I serve as that Te ""let me help you get your life together"" person for my best friend.

3 years later he's still nervous hahaha but he's extremely vocal about what he thinks now (major Ti development) and with that dynamic we've never argue. Literally in 3 years we've never argued.

He's seen me cry, I've seen him cry. I was there for him when his dad died and weekly help him take care of him mom. ESFJs like to support amd provide for other people but they too need help and support likely not admitting you. You definitely have to play mind reader but that's literally what Ni does and is good for. When I'm unsure of the best course of action I'll straight up ask him.

INTJs are better at making decisions than ESFJ because we have the decider functions (F/T) in the middle. But ESFJs are better observers because they have the observer functions in the middle (S/N). If you think Ni is seeing something you're better off asking than waiting since you'll be at a stand off due to their core insecurity.

Hope this helps.",1615577538
ESFJ,"Hi fellow INTJ,

So obviously I'm neither ESFJ nor female but I was in your situation as well. And now we're together, so there's your answer. In the beginning she was nervous af. She used to be so incredibly jumpy whenever we interacted. You could literally see her heart fluttering. It was insane and I'm ngl sometimes I couldn't handle that much energy.

She's still like that even tho she calmed down a bit. It's still too much for me sometimes but other times I get the most intense tingles, it's infectious.

That's one of the things I love about her. Sometimes I'm deep in my head and she has the power to get trough. She's the best thing that's ever happened to me so go for it.

For me being myself worked just fine. Me being so calm (but also I guess witty/sarcastic) drove her crazy. When she gets all energetic I just let myself go with her.

My advice? I don't have any. I'm sure she's into you and if you feel the same or if you feel good around her, just let it happen and don't think too much about it (jk, I know that's not possible).

Good luck and keep me posted if you will.

Oh and I'm European (German to be exact) as well, even tho I guess a country's culture matters quite a lot.",1615575935

ESFJ,"Good explanation! 


I'll add just that Ni doesn't like opened options. I have very... frenemy relationship with Ne. Without exploring options, I cannot reach a conclusion worth anything, and at the same time I don't want to see more of them. And yes, Ni users have bad memory on details. Due to that, we may forget the details that actually matter to the whole connection in our minds. It's very tiring to work with details. Most awkward situations happen... Like forgetting names 30 seconds after meeting someone new(due to demon Si too). 


But this applies to me, personally, doesn't have to apply to all Ni users.",1615450989

I've seen a couple examples of Ni now and I have to say, it makes perfect sense when you've seen it happen, but it makes no sense at the start, the way it makes sense to them. I guess it's just that their minds work in quite the opposite way.

ESFJ,[deleted],1615427861
ESFJ,"Ni users interpret what they observe into impressions, meaning, symbolism, patterns, or an overarching conclusion and then store that away. Ni is subjective, focused and precise, being used primarily to find a specific personal solution for the user, using all the data available to it. It is not an ever expanding web like Ne. Instead, Ni will naturally zero in on one singular conclusion. Ni users don’t store away mundane individual details. From a practical standpoint, this means that an Ni user won’t tend to have a very detailed memory. Sure, an Ni user will have a memory and remember some details, but as whole their memory will be more impressionistic or big picture focused. For instance, an Ni user might meet someone and take in sensory data to draw them to the conclusion that the person is bad news. Maybe they’ll take in the data consciously, maybe it’ll be more like a “gut” feeling (aka: subconscious), but chances are the only thing they’ll remember later is that the person was bad news. In general, most of what they observe will be subconscious sensory data translated into their interpretation of its meaning. Later down the road, they’ll recall the patterns and meanings so that when a similar event comes up, they’ll “just know” how it’s going to play out. What they might not realize though, is that they’re subconsciously remembering all of the similar events from their past and those patterns are suggesting a probable outcome. This is why Ni users are stereotyped as psychics and sages. They don’t really know how they know… they just know.",1615417430
ESFJ,I scored 24 and I'm a female ESFJ.,1615409674
ESFJ,"Ni is an enigma to me. I feel like these people are psychic? I guess they can make patterns to predict outcomes and make decisions. So for example, instead of going through a process of step 1, step 2, step 3... Step 10, they can jump from step 2 to 10. It's like they just know stuff.

I always could tell that I was different from intuitive people. Since before I had any idea what Meyers Briggs was. It's like some people could just get stuff. I have to practice things a lot to understand. When I try to do something for the very first time, it's rough. I need to remember what I did before to be able to do it again. As I've gotten older, I think I've improved. Sometimes I have cool ideas now, and I'm like oh that must be me using Ne. Practicing at life I guess.",1615408141
ESFJ,"Yeah I hate guessing. There's so many unknowns with a guess. How do you make sure your guess is right? I have tons of anxiety about it. You're right, I want concrete information. If I have to take a guess on something, I will. But I will spend a ton of time thinking about, mulling all the information in my head. It's stressful lol.",1615407840
ESFJ,"Most of a types problems come from the lack of development of the inverse last function.

That's where I'd focus the energy. F trumps T whether people are willing to admit it or not. You have to develop the F as a T and Fs need to develop the T as Fs.

As an INTJ who needs Si, I almost exclusively surround myself with Si people to nag the shit out of me when I'm not doing Si when I should hahaha. I dated a Ti/Si INTP who did this and my close INFP friend who is Fi/Si literally calls me every single day ato hold me accountable of doing Si things haha.

Focus on the Fi, figure out what your core values are. CBT is good at doing that. Journaling should help so you can visually the the topics Ne/Fe love to get tied up in and try to find the Ni/Fi core issues being expressed in your own thinking.",1615406397
ESFJ,"I see myself using Fe often in social situations. Especially when dealing with people, I tend to use Fe more than Ti. I guess Fi is where the problem must be. I rarely bother to consider what I feel, but then, most feeling rarely ever make any sense. But I guess I need to figure out a way around that. Knowing what I feel and what I believe in are important and simply sitting around complaining about not knowing how I feel isn't going to help.",1615399276
ESFJ,"Np, sorry to hear about those challenges, I hope things get better for you with time! Thanks! ✌️",1615397453
ESFJ,The apathy is ignoring Fe. INTPs are insecure about others feelings right. So the attentiveness goes away when Fe is no longer being considered in social settings or personal relationship but it also could be the lack of Fi. Fi is personal values so it can be hard for someone with Fi dead last to know what they believe in. If you develop enough Fi you'll figure out which hills you're willing to die on.,1615397390
ESFJ,"&gt;However Ni in INTPs is a critic function (the opposite of the second function). What INTPs are supposed to do is when they engage in Ne they're supposed to check with what they want, how it will affect them in the long run before engaging whatever it is. But most INTPs don't do this and end up not allowing themselves to want things and this is way INXPs are infamous for failure to launch syndrome. By not allowing themselves to want things they don't get started.

Oh, so apathy is caused by chasing after things or ideas that won't necessarily help me in the long run?

Also thank you for this. I still haven't understood it fully, but I guess that can't be helped. I'll get there eventually. I'll definitely check out these sources.",1615396678
ESFJ,"Thank you! 
Same here, i still need to explain to him why i reacted in a certain way sometimes. 

I completely agree with you, having similar values really does help. We had our fair share of “hard times” over the past year, But fortunately we were able to get past them.  
Thank you for sharing your experience. 
Best wishes to both of you.",1615377769
ESFJ,"That's very commendable! : ) Glad to hear that. I was curious because, in my experience, the earlier stages of relationships tend to be a bit more dreamy/ideal in the sense that it's easier to look past those minor irritations that tend to build up and become larger issues over time. There are many such things that I did not see early on in my relationship that I honestly didn't know to look for that have had to be carefully dealt with later on. Not that I'm the baseline, but you get what I'm saying. 

My SO is an ISFJ so I do not share any function preferences with them either(although, theoretically, not nearly as much stress as INTJxESFJ due to strong weakness preferences), and it is work sometimes having to explain my reactions to things and my point of view. Thankfully we are both practicing healthy techniques like you are, and we also have extremely similar values, so it works. That's not to say though that it's been easy. I'd imagine that ""hard times"" can have really have their way with couples like us if we're not diligent in the early stages. Best wishes to you both!",1615377075
ESFJ,"I can relate, sensing how other people feel has been something i’ve been working on for years now since i realized it is a weakness of mine 10 years ago. Since this is something i am not naturally good at  i still can’t be at his level (the ESFJ) even after years of trying LOL. Sometimes he gets mad at something i did and i would have no idea that he’s mad,  and unless he says exactly how and why he feels that way i wouldn’t be able to understand. This is something that gets on his nerves sometimes. But he knows that i try and is OK with my effort so we’re good. 
One thing he does that gets on my nerves is the fact that he would help other people to the point where he ignores and forgets about his own needs. I have to constantly remind him to take care of himself. 
We’ve come far in the communication aspect, when i think back to the beginning of the relationship, both of us improved a lot.
Thank you for your reply, i appreciate it.",1615376416
ESFJ,"Hi, trying to answer your question, I'm going to try to explain my experience as an ESFJ (female) dating an INTJ (male).  

One of the most important things to highlight is, as in all relationships, the need for communication between both parts of the couple.  

If we speak in terms of cognitive functions, the dominant function of one is the trickster function (that is, the one that is not known to use) of the other. 

My dominant function is Extroverted Feeling, which equates to caring about the feelings of others, and being aware of what they feel.  My partner, who is INTJ, does not have that ""capacity"" so developed, so every time I am sad, angry, etc., I have to tell him specifically how I feel so that he can understand it.  

On the other hand, his main role is Introverted Intuiton, which makes him focus a lot on the future.  I don't have that capacity, I can't answer the typical question ""Where do you see yourself in 5 years?"" So for future plans, or visions of it, he has to tell me his point of view.  

All of this is closely related to insecurities, so good communication is mandatory.  

I hope I could be of help.",1615375123
ESFJ,"Observe her behaviours around others, is she still like her usual self? Or is she more, i guess reserved or isolated? Or is she just more on edge than usual? If she is acting normal to everyone else you may want to ask her what’s up and if that doesn’t work, it would be better in the long run to let it go.

However, if she is acting, well, different to everyone else as well then you may want to check in on her to see if she is struggling or take it as far as getting help for her",1615371887
ESFJ,"If she took it out on a random person who she wouldn’t have any built-up grudge against - it sounds like my INFP friend who sometimes gets really tired (of socialising, etc) but hides her tiredness until she releases all the stress in one go.

What your ESFJ friend reason for lashing out depends on the motive tho. (Did they not like spending time with them Were they desperate for the person to spend more time with them and felt ignored? etc etc)

But I doubt it was all fine for her mentally even when you were laughing. ‘Lashing out’ is a form of stress-relief and it doesn’t come out of nowhere.

Me and some of my ESFJ friends, when we don’t truly 100% like someone, can sometimes end up hiding the fact that socialising with them is stressful / not enjoyable / more tiring than stimulating and after hiding that feeling for too long, I notice we become more critical of the person that makes us feel that way and say what we don’t like about them. Then just walk away. It is more passive-aggressive than aggressive tho. But you will know that after an annoyed look and critical comment against you that I/they don’t like you.

It’s too embarrassing (personally and for my ESFJ friends at least) to lash out aggressively or explosively against someone, due to judgment of the situation (people are watching, etc). So unless your ESFJ friend was reaaaaaaaaaally exhausted to the point they couldn’t ‘judge’ the situation to avoid embarrassment like this, and had so much stress and critical thoughts built-up over time against this person, I can’t imagine that they would just lash out publicly (it was in front of you) against the person in front of many people.

I have had loads of built-up grudge against one person before, but I did it over text and in front of people at school, I would just try to ignore her and walk away from her rather than make a scene coz it’s embarrassing to me and my reputation for people to notice and say “hahahha you have beef against ___”.",1615368159
ESFJ,"Yes i do feel the same thing. I think we both developed our inferior functions more after we got together. I do admit it was hard at first but we worked on it and now we’re much better. 
This was nice to read, thank you",1615367104
ESFJ,"It's amazing! INTJ female here. My best friend is an ESFJ and my best past relationship is with an ESFJ.

ESFJ-INTJ is the 3rd most compatible for each other.

The cognitive looping is very addicting. I developed emotionally because of my ESFJ grandmother, ISFJ mother and INFP mentor.

I absolutely adore ESFJs. I'd date them in a heartbeat.

For a type to get their shit together they need the opposite of their last function. So for INTJs it's Si and ESFJs it's Te.

Being an Ni/Te INTJ this works extremely well with my Fe/Si ESFJ best friend.

Highly recommend the relationship.",1615366079
ESFJ,Thanks. It's just strange. I did text her later and she said she isn't mad at me but things are not the same. She doesn't text me to hang out anymore it's weird. Do I reach out again or let it go?,1615364867
ESFJ,No nothing was built up on. It just came out of nowhere. We were perfectly fine and laughing before that.,1615364832
ESFJ,"Almost a year now, our relationship is very good mainly because we both prioritize good communication and honesty. 
We both changed for the better during this year.",1615363573
ESFJ,"I'm neither an ESFJ nor INTJ, so I hope I'm not too unwelcome! With that said, neither of you share the same function preferences and you actually prioritize the other's weaknesses. While all good relationships usually share a certain amount of core values/worldviews I really recommend the prioritization of these in relationships such as yours and those similar to them. It will form a protective backbone in hard times. While type isn't everything, I believe it accounts for much so it is good to take into heavy consideration. How long have you two been together?",1615337896
ESFJ,"Got 17. I'm diagnosed combination ADHD and have visual sensory issues. My brain doesn't filter out things I'm seeing, so when a lot is going on (see: Costco) i get overwhelmed. Inside standing three inches away from a Monet painting and having to determine what you see.",1615322735
ESFJ,"That’s an accurate imagination, i do see myself in this.
It did help, thank you!",1615319869
ESFJ,"No problem, just keep in mind we FEEL stuff out so if we feel something off we retract back.  So communication is vital to us.",1615319564
ESFJ,"I’m an ESFJ female... never dated a male INTJ, but I worked closely with two at my last job. I can only share what I imagine a close relationship with them might be and how I might feel. I’ll save you the reasoning as to WHY I might feel this way since it’s based on 3 years of observation and “work friendship”...

I imagine being with an INTJ would make me feel very cared for, as though the practical matters in our relationship were safe and well-managed. I might find them to be compassionate and thoughtful, but not as their primary qualities... I would feel like those qualities were reserved for me/their romantic relationships... which would also make me feel special and cared for. I would trust them and I would look up to them in some way. Their ability to think, research, and take action is admirable to me. I admire their seemingly dichotomous nature — work/outward appearance versus who they were at home. I could certainly see myself in such a relationship. I’m more emotional and my inward identity very much matches who I project. I’m emotional and caring and having people like me is somewhat important. I appreciate people who can manage a variety of responsibility and even identities (sociopaths aside). Not sure if this helps, but I do like INTJs and thought I’d chime in.",1615319511
ESFJ,"I will, Thank you!",1615319113
ESFJ,That is a good combination(compatibility&amp;complimentary of each other’s weakness/strengths)  from personal experience. The downfall would be INTJs texting/communication habits. Make sure you let him know when you are going MIA to re charge or for whatever reason.,1615318901
ESFJ,I got 14,1615313814
ESFJ,"Same. I scored a 109 on the other test and a 13 on the first one. I am very sensitive and influenced by those around me, have a rich inner world, and experience intense pain and emotions. I just am not bothered by loud external noises or multitasking, which seem to be what some of the criteria is focused on. That may be due to the extroversion aspect of being an ESFJ. The SF makes us very observant and feeling, but the E and J tone down what might otherwise be overwhelming (lots of tasks, energy-filled environment). Curious to see the results of this study.",1615312984
ESFJ,"I clicked on results first cause i was curious but i did the test (And i'm ESFJ, Male).

I scored 13 but i would probably categorize myself as  highly sensitive since the questions i answered felt extremely true.",1615310868
ESFJ,"ESFJ, they’re very nice and fun to talk to",1615310286
ESFJ,CS Joseph. 😬,1615290847
ESFJ,"Is it a cop out to say all of them? Lol, I've met someone from each type and they all have their lovely points.

I love ISTJs, my husband and work-wife are ISTJs.

INTP, as one of my best friends and favorite coworkers are those.

ESTJ, as a very good friend and someone I love to talk about world politics with.

ISFP because my mother in law (😍) and very good friend are those.

Fellow ESFJs, my mother, sister, and beloved coworker.

I love ENTPs for their creativity, INTJs for their quick thinking skills, INFJ for their ability to see past the obvious, ENTJs for their abilities in herding cats, ISFJs for their selflessness in serving others,  ESTP and ESFPs for wanting people to have a good time and their boldness, INFP and ENFP for wanting to understand the ones overlooked.",1615290734
ESFJ,❤️,1615289833

ESFJ,I also pick up my bf’s dirty socks and put them on his work desk LOL. Great annoyed minds think alike,1615244127
ESFJ,The damn socks!!! My ENTP partner always takes off his socks at the end of the day and leaves them by the couch. Instead of picking them up now I kick them over right by his work desk so he can pick up his own damn dirty socks!,1615231066
ESFJ,I’ll give this a go,1615163350
ESFJ,What did they lash out about? Was there an argument involved beforehand? (In which their might have been built-up grudge against a specific person that came out all at once?),1614897190
ESFJ,"A lot of what you said sounded ENFJ to me but that doesn't necessarily mean anything for sure. If you're looking at 16 personalities, don't. It's alright but I find it to be very stereotypical. I would look at personality hacker. They have a test I think is better than the 16 personalities. 

I'm almost feeling ISFJ from you but I'm an internet stranger who doesn't know you lol.",1614896244
ESFJ,"Functions are the answer. [Here](https://www.careerplanner.com/8CognitiveFunctions/Cognitive-Functions-Simply-Explained.cfm) is where you start. Read the first page to the end. Then, scroll up and there are functions. When you click on them, that's how main functions manifest. Only main ones, to not get you confused. Never take tests and 16personalities is the worst one. It is not mbti test. They just like to call themselves that way.",1614870847
ESFJ,"Cool, practical, down to earth. I only know one [typed] ISTP and we get along great. We work at the same hospital, different departments, and we often grab lunch together.",1614858876
ESFJ,"Try Grandson, best alternative rock artist imo",1614856503
ESFJ,"Oh I get it. And same. Thus I don't have a favorite ganre/artist. I just like the song and that's really it. For reading, jazz and classical music is the best, sometimes vaporwave. I liked metal before too lol. Just a huge mix, it all depends on a song.


Yeah I get it. It's pretty nice. Tbh I would like something with high Se these days. Lockdown is hitting not only extroverts...",1614856312
ESFJ,"It really depends on my mood tbh, and since I've started working on those playlists I've honestly been listening to so many different styles lol

For the playlists tho, I'm focusing on the songs' vibes that match the type's energy, as vague as it sounds, or lyrics that remind me of people or fictional characters I know",1614855751
ESFJ,Since we're waiting for suggestions... What is your type and what music you like? I'm sure music isn't completely connected to a type but still.,1614855557
ESFJ,Of course!,1614855342
ESFJ,I don't have suggestions. Only a question. Can you give a link to your spotify lists later?,1614855249
ESFJ,Im wondering what is your ennea-type versus her enneatype🤔,1614825687
ESFJ,Yes,1614815786
ESFJ,"Lmfao this is me with my INTJ friend almost exactly. Friend for 5 years now, but had a massive blowout argument about 2 years ago and didn’t talk for 6 months.  

Really taught us a lot about how to communicate with each other and how to value and manage each other’s feelings. Back to being close friends for coming up on 2 years now!",1614814567
ESFJ,"It’s such a blessing and curse, isn’t it! 😂😢",1614813772
ESFJ,[deleted],1614813541
ESFJ,Yep! I re-play both positive and negative situations all the time. I can change my entire mood just by thinking about a happy or sad thing that’s happened in the past.,1614813077
ESFJ,"Yup... It depends not about mbti. But about your past, your environment. Those are things that form a personality, constantly. Just normal, basic psychology.",1614812894
ESFJ,"I do this all the time. And it could be dumb stuff. Things that make me laugh, or bring a slight smile to my face, and even make me laugh out loud 🥴 it’s nice to know I’m not alone lol

edit: I do think about negative things too. Things that make me cringe like “whyyy did I do that?!” Or make me feel like “dang I shouldn’t of did that”.. but not like a sad regretful feeling, more like a “ugh, oh well.. that happened”",1614811139
ESFJ,"yes, quite a bit. at night i often feel bad for that person i met at walmart 2 years ago who i was quite rude to",1614808563
ESFJ,[deleted],1614803106
ESFJ,[deleted],1614803069
ESFJ,"I try to, but I don’t make it a long drawn apology. It’s more like “hey sorry I said that to you earlier” and then I move on",1614798404
ESFJ,But you don't say sorry?,1614798351
ESFJ,I am definitely aware that I have a tendency to do this and do try to at least acknowledge what I did.,1614797727
ESFJ,Do you later apologize to your friends or do you just brush it off?  I don't like being a punching bag :),1614797573
ESFJ,"I’m ngl, I do this sometimes. Not often, but sometimes",1614796113
ESFJ,"Depends on an individual. When I'm stressed, I'm easily irritable and I just bomb if you poke me enough and for some time. 


I cannot know what heppened between you two. If she had her reasons to lash directly at you because you did something to her or because she has overall enough and just couldn't take it.


It may not be right, but the action can be excused more if you look at the background. It is not justifying the action, but you get why the person acted the way they did. If you tell her that it did hurt you, I'm sure she will apologize. When we're using demon functions, we have clouded thinking. But once she calms down she will realize what she did, probably.",1614795957
ESFJ,"Well it's true but when I am stressed at work I take it out on myself and not at my friends or anything.

So I wanted to know from an ESFJ how do they process stress and emotions?

Honestly I did reach out to her and she is better now. She didn't apologize for acting out on me or my friend but I did say I am sorry for speaking back at her telling her it was not right to lash at me even though I don't think I did anything wrong but I just wanted to keep the harmony.",1614795367
ESFJ,"That happens when a person is under stress for some time. Happens to all of us.


Try helping her out. If you can, take her out for coffee or just meet up at your place and talk. Do things she would enjoy doing. If you know what to do, help her with work.",1614791503
ESFJ,Oh I know she currently has issues at work right now and she was really stressed the past week. She even yelled at some other person I know but I've never seen thsi side of her.,1614790746
ESFJ,"What she did was probably demon Te.


But again, ANY type can lash out. Nothing with mbti. Just normal human psychology. You should check up on your friend. If she lashed out, something was bothering her for a long time or she just has enough of things happening around her. Let her talk it out, if she wants to.",1614790419
ESFJ,He just blue himself,1614742159
ESFJ,"Not my type, that's for dang sure.

Also, I come in peace from a faraway land.",1614737640
ESFJ,Do you share the answers?,1614718617
ESFJ,[deleted],1614718543
ESFJ,Please put the results when you're done!,1614717396
ESFJ,"i agree he was trying to act “cool” in front of his friends, sad thing but true :/

he might be thinking/is worried his friends won’t approve, definitely trying to act cool, even if he is intrigued by you.

but he seems to have been looking at you for a while, so i say DEFINITELY INTRIGUED, he at least wants to be friends and get to know you.

as a result he might feel unable to go up to you, even if he wants to, so if you feel up to it and confident you could go up to him!",1614378697
ESFJ,It’s interesting that nobody has selected “gifts”,1614375707
ESFJ,"Sounds like she is just being friendly and feels comfortable around you. Nothing you mentioned makes it appear that she doesn’t like you, but it also doesn’t sound like she necessarily has romantic feelings for you just because of the extra attention.",1614371768
ESFJ,i typically show affection through acts of service but i prefer physical touch,1614366063
ESFJ,I think all of them! But most of all I Iike to shower people with compliments. And I truly mean them! I will think of the person and figure out a meaningful and accurate compliment to tell them.,1614354410
ESFJ,"I think this is a tricky question. No one can read his mind. Especially us since we don't know him. There are certainly some speculations we could make. If he is staring at you a lot, he must know you exist. He could have told his friend that just to look cool and not admit he is interested in you. But I don't think we have evidence here to say what specifically he is interested in, or if he likes you or dislikes you.

Do you ever talk to him? Maybe you could try to start a conversation. Do you have any similar interests? You don't need to tell him what you heard if you don't want to. You could just try it and see how it goes.",1614354291
ESFJ,This is beautiful,1614354000
ESFJ,Same haha,1614351389
ESFJ,I’m def physical touch and words of affirmation but could only select one,1614349650
ESFJ,Physical touch. If I love you ill hug/cuddle with you.,1614348456
ESFJ,"I think it would be the opposite. We as a general rule don't like to be an inconvenience to people, so an ""act of service"" no matter the intent and willingness of the person puts us off.",1614348428
ESFJ,"No. We had a very direct conversation about whether being together would be good or not and he was the first to say no we shouldn’t, it’s not logically a good idea",1614348363
ESFJ,"Me: * Is busy with lots of work, feels like anything could exhaust me any second. *
Friend: “Something horrible happened...”
Me: * Mental battery instantly at 100% and determined to help at all costs! * “Aw tell me what happened honey? 🥺❤️“",1614342892
ESFJ,I would say isfp bc shadow functions,1614326407
ESFJ,"I think there is a gaggle of ghosts right next to where you sit, and he is the only one who can see them. 🤷‍♀️",1614325987
ESFJ,I thought most ppl would say acts of service tbh due to the stereotypes,1614324588
ESFJ,"To answer your first question, this one is a real degenerate. Aside from my self-deprecative humor and sarcasm, I like competition and winning, chess, driving/racing my car (in the mountains), riding my bicycle, learning a skill (can be anything really), helping my close friends (currently helping a friend with financial and life choices and the other with dating), critical thinking and thinking about things deeply (usually skill, interactions with people, etc.), and analyzing people. Having people close to me is a mixed bag-one hand it is nice for my comfort and on the other it can be a burden. I am usually alone (quarter of a century stage in life); however, when I was young I would spring about and made friends easily.

Second question, not really. I get along with everyone on a shallow level. Sometimes I will have conversations with people because I can feel they need comfort as do I; so why not? Socialization is just a way for me to feel 'all righty'. It's just a way to draw energy, but, sometimes, it can be pretty damn draining. Socializing with the right people &gt; socializing with many people. Frankly, I used to have a lot of friends and was semi-popular, but I've actually decided to go back to the cave from whence I came.

I think to some degree I do fit the ESFJ stereotype, but in some ways I do break it.",1614323137
ESFJ,"Ah! sorry, I meant r/whatsbotheringyou, forgot an ""s"" there. My mistake.",1614308678
ESFJ,The 2nd one u listed isn't a Reddit community,1614307517
ESFJ,"I'm gonna be honest here, I looked through your post history a bit, and I don't think mbti subreddits are the best for this. Check out r/Advice, r/whatbotheringyou, or maybe even r/relationship_advice I think it might help you a bit more than MBTI subreddits could. Also this doesn't have much to do with MBTI anyway.",1614306758
ESFJ,Fuzzy blankets and scented candles are my love language.,1614297925
ESFJ,"The language of seduction is spoken on a different level than the direct meaning of words. In another frequency is maybe a better explanation fellow INTP. 

If I would follow your advice, the fun would be over.",1614293012
ESFJ,"Thank you this is really helpfull :).

Though do you think he is sometimes  in his bed crying when you are with another guy ? lol :(",1614292511
ESFJ,Yes! Someone who gets it!,1614281238
ESFJ,When its cold out you can find me scurrying around the house with a blanket draped over me like a cape. 😂,1614280150
ESFJ,I mean blankets are the most comforting thing out there and if it’s someone close to you maybe giving you a blanket is a sign of them wanting you to be comfortable,1614270909
ESFJ,Why wouldn’t you like a blanket?,1614268615
ESFJ,"My favorite gifts are practical, functional gifts! I can easily spread blankets around my home.",1614263801
ESFJ,Same. I'm too difficult to separate from them.,1614231786
ESFJ,I’m addicted to soft blankets,1614231726
ESFJ,"I see gifts as a way to show that you know something about someone. A blanket isn’t particularly thoughtful. 

I love blankets, but I’d never give one as a gift unless there was a reason to give a specific blanket to a specific person. Maybe if the pattern reminded me of them?",1614229229
ESFJ,Love them! The softer the better. Nothing like burrowing yourself under a pile of blankets on the couch.,1614225330
ESFJ,"If someone comes at me with a question like this I'm going to assume they trust me enough for my honest opinion. I do not like lying, but I will not be brutal with the truth. There is such thing as a happy medium.

As for this scenario, the person asking should have tempered their expectations or just not asked the question. If you won't like the answer then don't ask the question.",1614206085
ESFJ,I'm interested!,1614187869
ESFJ,"I think this context sounds rude, but there could be nuances. If the people have a close relationship, then perhaps the friend is looking out for their other friend and is trying to be helpful. If the people aren't that close, then the asker should probably mind their own business. Intention matters here.

Also, is the asker trying to manage this person's appearance by telling them what to do? They aren't accepting them for who they are? Why does it matter for the asker to try and make these points to the 'ugly' person who is clearly uncomfortable?",1614179545
ESFJ,I'm so glad to hear that,1614178071
ESFJ,"I voted not esfj because it's true. As an INTP  I can be pretty brutally honest and I can't say I would just go and tell this person that they are ugly but a good way to evade this question with another question like 'why are you asking that do you think you're ugly?' then you both can proceed into reasons why this person may not be the ""prettiest"" or ""handsome"" or whatever but it can be a good opportunity to go into what I'm sure great features this person does have.  But I'm saying this like if you presented this as a situation that actually happened.",1614175892
ESFJ,"I would say not anymore. Self hatred never came from being an ESFJ, but from not accepting my flaws and embracing the fact that I can improve. I was diagnosed with combination ADHD in a time where ADHD/ASD was being first recognized. A lot of internalized (and in some instances externalized) hatred to go around there.

Also the loss of my Christian faith has helped me accept who I am. Being constantly reminded that I'm not worthy and am a bad person for being born will fuck you up. 

Maybe it also came with age. Who knows. All I do know is that I am happy with who I've become, and I'm looking forward to improving as a person, a professional, a mother, and a wife. Life is good.",1614156679
ESFJ,Thank you :),1614141812

ESFJ,"ESFJ here with an INTJ for nearly 3 years. It was paradise at first, then our communication differences settled in at 5 months and we started fighting pretty regularly. It was misunderstanding after misunderstanding. We have been working on how we fight and communicate ever since. It took living together throughout COVID to REALLY understand each other. It’s back to paradise now. We just know how to be each other’s best partners at this point. It’s a very fulfilling relationship with lots of potential for growth. You just have to learn to compromise.",1614123919
ESFJ,"I always want him to be as open as possible because I am bad at understanding people's feelings/thoughts. Sometimes I'm too pessimistic and I get lost in my negative mind and he quickly sees it and washes away my negative thoughts. He talks a lot, I dont need to talk actively and it makes me comfortable because I dont like to talk as much as he does. He shows me different aspects of life. Sorry for the late response, you can text me on dm and ask me what you want to know.",1614119217
ESFJ,Thanks for the fast reply! I would need to check what he has. And i Will get back to you. But lets just assume he would be the same as you how would that help?,1614114438
ESFJ,Socionics is less stereotyping and more detailed than mbti. Socionics gives a lot of details about the personalities and has a different system. I am INTj(LII) in socionics and i can help you if he/she has the same personality.,1614114338
ESFJ,"What is that? That is new to me, socionoms type? LII? What is that?🙈",1614114095
ESFJ,What is his socionics type? If he is LII maybe i can help,1614111801
ESFJ,"mbti uses cognitive functions to theorize that people *make decisions* using the same tools but with varying priority for each one. it's not about likes or dislikes. saying that an esfj *doesnt like* theory primarily because Ne is one level inferior to Si is a misinterpretation of mbti. it's as vague as saying that an infp likes art. 

even if the statement understood mbti properly, preference for theory has little if not nothing to do with reddit usage",1614111028
ESFJ,"Yes I do, cognitive functions. I'm not sure if you understand that ESFJ don't like theories according to mbti",1614110289
ESFJ,....it's not clear whether or not you understand what mbti theorizes,1614109234
ESFJ,Except that according to MBTI: ESFJ's don't like theories and there is Theory in the T of MBTI lol.,1614108703
ESFJ,I cannot fathom a relationship between an INTJ and esfj they're the opposite of each other. Too critical for the loving ESFJ :(,1614108211

ESFJ,"I feel like my reply lacks nuance, as INTP are in general wonderful people.

The question on that post was how to create and foster meaningful friendships. This post has more to do with romantic relationships, but I hope it’s helpful.


**TL, DR:**
•	Find a therapist
•	Work on yourself – hobbies, projects, etc. **alone** activities.
•	Validate your own feelings, needs and wants
•	Learn to communicate your feelings, needs and wants
•	Don’t jump to YES without really thinking things through


I (INFJ, F) am not an MBTI expert; however, I feel very confident about my partner (M) being an ESFJ from many anecdotes and conversations, including his own comments as to how he regards himself.
I went on a little investigation/interview with my partner (I *have* told about MBTI but he has ZERO interest in it - thus me taking this on), to learn more about how him as a young and not very wise ESFJ went about things and self-actualized. We ended up speaking more so in terms of romantic relationships, but I still think there are good lessons.


Let’s call him Rick. Rick told me in the past he did not have healthy views on relationships/girls. He felt the need to control situations, and people. He admitted he did not let people just make their own decisions.  He was in denial that others should have autonomy based on their own feelings or motivations (this actually didn’t make any sense to me). 


•	Mainly, Rick just wanted to control things. He gave me a made-up example:


Imagine we, as a couple, are making plans for Friday night. I (op) want to go to our usual chill hangout/brewery. Rick (ESFJ) wants to go see live music. He would try to convince me, indirectly, out of wanting to go to the brewery. By indirectly I mean that he wouldn’t outright say “I want you to go with me to see live music”. No, he would maneuver the conversation, and pretty much social engineer me, until I had talked myself out of it. Then, he would say we could do this other thing instead (going to the live music). 
 

I was so shocked by this, to be honest, it just sounds so toxic! He went on to explain why he would do it - now, older and wiser, Rick acknowledges that he often felt like he was not “allowed” to state his wants and needs. Telling his SO, “I want to do this instead” was unthinkable. It was better to let them lose interest themselves (yes, even with manipulation/influencing), so *he* did not have to break it to them that he wanted something different. This was a way to avoid confrontation/keep the SO content, keep everyone at peace, and basically, continue to be liked.
 

•	Another thing Rick has told in the past is that he ALWAYS said YES to relationships. 


If this type of behavior sounds a bit like ESFJ, please do read on! And if it doesn’t; well, let me know as I may be mis-typing him, haha.


**Anyway, now to the “helpful” part of this novel:**


Rick has been going to therapy for a long time now. Part of his therapist’s advice has been to work on himself. Art, hobbies, spending time doing things he enjoys, ALONE.


Also, when looking at relationships, asking himself if he actually means YES or if it’s half-assed. If you say YES to avoid confrontation, to avoid hurting someone, “why not?”, etc. That’s all half-assed. When you say YES, mean it! Is this person good for you/good to you? *ARE THEY?* **ARE THEY???**


MOST IMPORTANTLY, Rick has learned with the help of his therapist to validate his own needs and wants. I read into this as working on self-esteem and also, to acknowledge that you have feelings that are completely valid, a part of you that should not be ignored by anyone, including yourself.


Along with this, effective/productive communication in relationships. It’s not just hearing what the other person wants, but also speaking up about what you want or need. 


**Regarding friendships **
Rick told me some of it was just plain luck! But it sounded like it was actually a lot of work. Some of it was going consistently to the same bars, a lot, and just speaking to people. Turning it into a task and having a goal of talking to at least 1 person. He said it was hard, but it was something he had to do if he wanted to meet people, and got easier with time.


Also, MeetUp groups, to start off meeting people with similar interests. We live in the Southern US, and close to the Bible Belt. He wanted smart, bright relationships in his life, so he joined Atheist/Agnostic social groups (I’m being totally serious). Not everyone was a keeper, but he did meet many smart, kind, mature friends, and things went smoother because they had things in common already. And I can vouch for these friends, because I’ve met them and they’re kind, open… just good people all around.


**My 2 cents:**
You ESFJ’s are such lovely people and so caring. Yes, I get that some of it comes from a selfish need to be liked. But I find my partner so completely genuine when he is in nurturing mode, that I know it’s also selfless/inherent to you. I am easily put off by fake people and pretentious attitudes. It’s not just outlandish bullshit, but a general lack of… self-awareness about being imperfect. I find that in previous relationships I thought very low of my partners when they did everything I wanted; or they just followed me along. I had no respect for them… they were just blobs inhabiting a body… “Jerry’s”. I’m so happy when my ESFJ speaks up when something is troubling him or he is just stating something he wants or doesn’t want. I have more respect for him! I see him as an equal, breathing human with wants and needs; imperfect and thus whole.",1617235256

ESFJ,"My best friend is and ESFJ. As an INTJ I need Si/Fe to get my shit together and ESFJs need Te/Ni to get their shit together so we spend every weekend together and have maybe argued 2 twice over our 5 years of friendship. We're two peas in a pot. But the craziest thing happened this weekend. We're both pretty into strategy video games, he was playing Gundam and I was playing Fire Emblem and watching him play a strategy game was mind blowing. I never realized how insanely different Si is from Ni. With Si being so in the moment his moves made sense short term but my Ni was freaking the fuck out seeing mistakes in the moves he was making long term. At one point I stopped him and pointed out all these potential problems with what he was doing. I'm an Ni/Te INTJ so I'm insanely talkative and love explaining things, he's an Fe/Ne ESFJ so he loves to listen and after hearing me out he stopped and looked at me like I crazy. I could tell he was just as confused about Ni strategy as I was Si strategy.

This is probably one of my favorite bonding moments with him because he's double feminine and I'm double masculine so he has a detailed memory and I have a visual memory so to attempt to explain Ni to him I literally drew out the positions of the ships, the areas they can travel and there they overlap and the problem of him positions the ships where he wanted to. It was this weird mutual respect moment but man the difference is crazy.

Knowing ESFJs need to develope Te/Ni to avoid crises later in life I go out of my way to try and explain the thinking behind both so he can learn to develop it himself (his Te has gotten SO much better and has been able to avoid conflict at work with it). I genuinely feel bad for ESFJ, Ni is this weird unexplainable mystery and you guys are magically supposed to develop it. I have Ni first and I don't even know how to explain it because Ni does do much. Trying to teaching someone this weird sixth sense is such a bizarre experience lol. As someone who needs Si/Fe it's pretty self explanatory and he's amazing and forcing me to use these functions but I now I have my work cut out for me in trying to teach Ni/Te lmao.

It was super cool to see the difference tho. Si is such a hard function to have too, mad respect.",1616980452
ESFJ,"I need your advice
There was a misunderstanding (which I didnt even know existed) between my friend who’s an ESFJ and I and this person told me that they want to cut ties with me.
I have apologized to my friend and my friend told me that they are glad we’ve resolved this but unsure if we could ever be friends again and that they wish the best of luck for me and that let’s just support each other at a distance.

Do you think this person completely shut me outta their life? Is there even a way for me to amend this relationship ever?",1616934199

ESFJ,"Hi all, just your average daisy-bearing, frolicking-in-the-fields INFP here. 

I work with a girl who is an ESFJ, and I’ve been trying to figure out what her intentions/feelings toward me are. We work in different departments and only cross paths a couple of times in a day (sometimes, none at all, given that our roles are very different) and have only gotten close very recently (within a span of one-two weeks...!).  She is leaving the company soon to live out in the boonies.  Up until that point, she was very shy with me and would only nod and smile whenever we bumped into each other in the elevator, or our in the hallway without initiating any conversation.  

One day, we worked on a task all day together and that happened to be when she starting asking me a bunch of questions/showing interest in me.  She asked for my number, and to connect on social media after that and texted me saying that she was glad she finally got to talk to me before leaving but regretted not doing so earlier.  She also mentioned that ever since she saw me, she was a “big fan” and had been wanting to talk to me ever since (which is strange, because for me personally, I don’t know how you can be a “fan” of someone without knowing them at all.) She has also mentioned that she was jealous seeing me joke around with other co-workers and wanted to secretly do the same. 

I asked her if she wanted to hang out outside of work before and despite being very, very busy with moving, and meeting friends and family for the last time, she willingly put me into her schedule to have dinner on a weekend.  She also has come out of her way to visit me at my desk, despite working on different floors, to have a chat and then apologized profusely for getting in the way of my tasks.

Maybe I’m being overly-analytical about this, but  I have no idea if she’s genuinely interested in me as a love interest or is just wanting to be friends/acts like this around everyone. I realize that ESFJs have a tendency to be nice to everyone, by complimenting them and making them feel all warm-and-fuzzy inside, but I can’t help but shake the feeling that she sees me differently from other people.

ESFJ,"I'm (INTJ 25F) dating an ESFJ (36M) and it's hard to know if he's interested or not. We have a great time on our dates but hardly talk in-between.

I'm guessing it's due to the age gap since I prefer texting and he's not a texter. He's always busy with work so I give him space. Anyways, I'm wondering what you guys do to show that you're interested in someone.

* We went to the same elementary, but I didn’t know her well. Everyone played a ball game (4 square) but I never saw her being competitive or getting mad at losing
* We got acquainted in high school after she suggested a classmate and I work together since we both had no partners
* She volunteered to help teachers in high school, allowed classmates to copy her work, helped a fraternity guy with studying to pass an exam even though it was raining, and she had to walk across campus
* Enjoys drawing, reading manga and fanfiction, watching anime, playing games, and doing cosplay.
* She was in drum corp in high school, joined a volunteer club but mostly for college applications, and was a college ambassador.
* She told me she’s too uncaring to do community service.
* Said she hates women who wear makeup because she believes they’re using their looks and social skills to impress people and gain benefits from them (i.e. good grades)
* Once she was writing a story about a character who hates humanity, can’t stand women, and said feelings are disgusting. She told me he’d go to a hotel in Ireland, happily watching the gloomy, rainy weather and getting joy at seeing people panic over flooding
* She doesn’t pay much attention in class because she’s usually doodling art during lessons or chatting with friends via notes
* Her demeanor is a bit blank (for lack of a better word) like she’s pretty straight faced with a normal speaking tone but still comes across on the friendlier/nicer side
* Tends to rush home after school and rush her homework during school hours to avoid having to do work at home. If she does have work to do at home, she mostly procrastinates
* She said she enjoys being lazy at home and if she’s out, she likes going to restaurants or stores with friends. She also said isolation drives her insane.
* Although she enjoys going to restaurants, she tends to choose very cheap restaurants. We once got our bill and she asked if we should give tip. I suggested 10% but she only put $1 down. She has self-proclaimed to be too cheap to buy most things
* She took advanced classes in high school, got decent grades, and is majoring in biology in hopes of having a career in research or biotech.
* She told me she doesn’t feel anything about mental health because everything that’s bad she twists up to something good or funny
* However she often vents to me about life, saying things like “Kill me” or other things like how she envies someone’s grades or how she’s feeling humiliated or can’t stand school
* She’s open about how she feels to me since she vents a lot, but I don’t know if she’s open with everyone or just people she feels closer to
* She can be critical of people and judgmental in a sense because she’s talk about how this person’s lazy or how that person’s desperate for attention
* Usually when she gets a bad test score, she’ll tell people she doesn’t try in school
* Pretty talkative person but usually is interested in speaking about school topics
* Got mad once about an arrogant woman with an attitude. She said the woman had a spoiled child personality and doesn’t appreciate what she has.
* Tends to worry for no reason
* Typically more passive, such as hinting at what she wants instead of directly telling people
* Can be defensive sometimes such as when I corrected her wrong answer during group work. She got mad then decided to not participate in the class activity anymore
* We don’t speak anymore after I once canceled a hangout on her to take an exam with a classmate. Since then, she gives short replies or ignores me.
* Likes to write Happy New Year statuses on Facebook. In one message she thanked people who interacted with her, said she made new friends, discovered how misery brings people together, and thanked friends for putting up with her",1615786387

The thing is, tgere has been a lot of miscommunication between us, and our most reccent fight was my fault. To cut the long story short, she got angry and refused to let me explain my side. Because of it, I apologised to her through text. I knew she was still angry with me because of how harsh her tone was with her reply. 

This weekend, I greeted her while at the dentist (her schedule was an hour later than mine)  then she gave me a stare then ignored me. Later, she talked to me and asked me about how my appointment went. I thought we were ok at first but her body language is telling me otherwise. Her interaction with me has gone minimal and she has been ignoring me to the point of placing her things away from my stuff and she's putting things between us to separatr herself from me.

I think I might have gotten into her bad side terribly this time. She had ignored our dad for many years before and I am afraid that our relationship is heading that route.

ESFJ,"So,  I'm and Intj and I really like this Esfj girl that I go to college with. 

We share the same groups of friends (although I'm kind of a loner in the group) and last year whenever we were together she would always avoid looking at me and if we made eye contact she would immediately look away, but would often look at me when she thought I can't see her. 

Than she started being more comfortable around me but at that point we still haven't ever talked to each other, although we are in the same group of friends (and she is of course very friendly to everyone else in college). Than I initiated conversation with her and we talked mostly about college stuff. After that, we haven't seen each other for  a few weeks and than when we saw each other few days ago she immediately initiated conversation with me and we started talking about college stuff and than also about more personal things, she seemed really engaged and comfortable. However, since then she has again become more distant and nervous. For example, when we saw each other today we made eye contact and I just greeted her with eyebrows and she said ""Hi"" and waved quite nervously and walked by quickly, however she still looks at me during classes and such.

I would like to know what could this kind of behavior indicate and what should I do. I mean, maybe she dislikes me (but wouldn't she avoid me than, and not look at me or make eye contact?), maybe she is scared of me (but she seemed really comfortable when we talked) or maybe she likes me (but why doesn't she show it than?). Or maybe it's something else? All in all, I am confused and would really appreciate if you ESFJs could help me.

So I am having a bit of trouble understanding what Ni is and how it works. So naturally, I went to the Ni doms' subreddit and asked them for their opinions.

However, I realized that asking an Ni dom to explain Ni, is a bit like using a flamethrower to transfer fuel. Sure, it might work, but there's every chance of an explosion. Instead, what I've found useful in understanding a cognitive function is having it as a blindspot. ESxJs have Ni as their blindspot, which makes you guys the most suitable candidates for this.

I get that this might be a bit much to ask, but here goes. For example, I'm an INTP and I have an Se blindspot. I've noticed this manifest throughout my life. Not noticing details, missing announcements in school have been a common occurrence for me. This is how I managed to gain a bit of insight into what Se might be. I'm looking for something similar, just with Ni. I'd love it if you could give me specific examples from your lives where you felt that you've missed this kind of perception.

ESFJ,"Hello, everyone I recently have been studying about sensory processing sensitivity (SPS) which is an attribute of highly sensitive persons (HSPs). I am curious to see if certain MBTI types are more likely to be HSPs than others, so I am going to post a poll in each subreddit about this. **You can find out if you are an HSP by taking the following test:** [**Are You Highly Sensitive? – The Highly Sensitive Person (hsperson.com)**](https://hsperson.com/test/highly-sensitive-test/)**. A score higher than 14 on this test indicates that you might have SPS (you are an HSP).** If you do not like the binary nature of this test you can take the version used by researchers here: [Microsoft Word - HSPSCALE\_2007\_research.doc (hsperson.com)](http://hsperson.com/pdf/HSPSCALE_2007_research.pdf). A score of 105 or higher on this version indicates that you likely are an HSP (I calculated this cutoff by using the cutoff for the shorter version which is 15/27 possible points and assuming that the same percentage of points on the longer test indicates that you are an HSP). **If you are willing please take the test to see if you are an HSP and then fill out the poll below. Thank you.**

I am also going to post some research articles here for those of you who would like to learn more about HSPs and the research behind it (I am quoting from another post that I made about this):

""Hello everybody, I have recently been looking at various studies regarding HPSs. To be honest when I first heard about HSPs I thought that the idea was either a false pop psychology idea, or autism spectrum disorder or anxiety disguised under a fancy name. However, after reading the studies I will list below I am now convinced that sensory processing sensitivity (SPS) is real and that being an HSP is a unique, valid concept. I believe these studies are useful to get an in-depth understanding of what it truly means to be an HSP and they can also be useful to show that the idea of HSPs is valid. Here are the studies:

[The functional highly sensitive brain: a review of the brain circuits underlying sensory processing sensitivity and seemingly related disorders (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5832686/) (Discusses fMRI studies of SPS in comparison to autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, and post-traumatic stress disorder. This review shows that SPS is its own separate, unique trait and is different from the previously mentioned disorders)

[The highly sensitive brain: an fMRI study of sensory processing sensitivity and response to others' emotions - PubMed (nih.gov)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25161824/) (Provides evidence that higher HSP scores are correlated with “stronger activation of brain regions involved in awareness, empathy, and self-other processing”)

[The trait of sensory processing sensitivity and neural responses to changes in visual scenes (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3023077/) (“SPS was associated with significantly greater activation in brain areas involved in high-order visual processing (i.e. right claustrum, left occipitotemporal, bilateral temporal and medial and posterior parietal regions) as well as in the right cerebellum, when detecting minor (*vs* major) changes in stimuli.”)

[Sensory Processing Sensitivity Predicts Individual Differences in Resting-State Functional Connectivity Associated with Depth of Processing - PubMed (nih.gov)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33561863/) (“The present study showed that SPS is associated with \[resting-state\] brain connectivity implicated in attentional control, consolidation of memory, physiological homeostasis, and deliberative cognition.

[Higher sensory processing sensitivity, introversion and ectomorphism: New biomarkers for human creativity in developing rural areas (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3409988/) (Discusses various aspects of SPS such as its involvement in creativity and also its presence in animals)

As reported elsewhere, each group exhibited greater activation for the culturally non-preferred task in frontal and parietal regions associated with greater effort in attention and working memory. However, further analyses, reported here for the first time, provided preliminary support for moderation by SPS. Consistent with the careful-processing theory, high-SPS individuals showed little cultural difference; low-SPS, strong culture differences.”)

Two hundred and one college students completed the highly sensitive person scale, as well as measures of anxiety, depression, alexithymia, and autism symptoms. EOE and LST were related to autism symptoms, alexithymia, anxiety, and depression. AES was related to attention to details (a symptom of autism) and anxiety but not to depression. It was also negatively related to externally-oriented thinking (a symptom of alexithymia). Results indicate that AES is conceptually distinct from LST and EOE. Furthermore, EOE interacted with difficulty identifying feelings in predicting anxiety, indicating that being both easily excited by stimuli and unable to identify one’s feelings is particularly anxiety provoking.”)

The HSPS scale was found to be reliable in this study and “Factor analysis revealed a novel five-factor solution (Negative Affect, Neural Sensitivity, Propensity to Overwhelm, Careful Processing and Aesthetic Sensitivity). As per previous reports, latent class analysis suggested a three class solution.” The study also discusses some weaknesses of the HSPS scale that could be improved such as the lack of reverse-coding in the assessment to address agreeability bias (i.e. reversing statements to make them negative). For example, I avoid violent movies could be easily reverse coded by switching the wording to I enjoy violent movies, but the original scale does not do this for any of the questions.)

ESFJ,"Hello everyone, I was recently wondering if there are any sort of correlations between MBTI type and political leanings, so I decided to post a poll in each MBTI type subreddit to assess this. I am aware that Reddit is not representative of the general population, so these results will not give an absolute indication as to where each MBTI type falls on the political spectrum on average, but I still think these polls could be useful to form relative comparisons (i.e. are INTJ Reddit users more liberal than ISTJ Reddit users, etc.). Please answer the poll and respond with any thoughts you have below. Thank you.

ESFJ,"hey guys, i began studying the mbti types like a month ago and when i got enfj as my type i was extremely surprised because the ""protagonist
 type"" really didnt feel like me, i always felt like i didnt belong anywhere and im so obssesed with being part of a certain community that i got obsessed with mbti. i really relate to some enfj things but at the same time im not really that “help seeker"", like i dont feel the need to always help, i want a lot of time for myself and sometimes im not even that extroverted, i always fake it especially at school, always change my
 personality to be liked and get along with everyone that i came to the realization that i dont even know who i am anymore. in extremely ambitious and i always want to improve myself and find new things to do. im energetic and positive but at the same time i feel lost and often misunderstood. i feel like i dont belong anywhere and with anyone and that i just change my personality so often that i dont know who i am anymore. whenever i see enfj movie characters they re always so lovely and extroverted while i have often my own introverted phases that i get confused of. everyone thinks of myself as the “kind and perfect person"", while the truth is completely different. am i really an enfj? what do

ESFJ,"I work with an ESFJ and trying to optimize our working relationship to get the best collaboration at our agency. Something I would like to try is to play to their strengths and let them do more tasks that can be characterized with their preferred working style. 

A lot of what I've read about ESFJ is in relation to how they are good at being sociable and that they are hard-working, which are inherently required at the job we both have (which is to say I can't pawn off anything requiring social interaction to them even if that's their strength). Those traits work in tandem with our tasks and I'm wondering are there specific things that ESFJs appreciate about the tasks they do? For example, knowing that ESFJ's like structure, I might hypothesize that my colleague would do well at a task that involves ongoing cadence. For example, ""Every Monday, please check in with this department and update the document with that information."" Does that sound appealing to ESFJs?

I also get the sense that my ESFJ may be prone to looking at things in a vacuum, favoring of the here-and-now rather than the larger picture in their thinking. For example, if we all receive the same data in a document, their instinct would perhaps be to take a look at the data and surmise what the data says (whereas I would likely look at the data, determine what it implies, take into consideration past data, current resources, and future goals, and make a recommendation on how to best proceed with that information given our goals). Is it fair to say ESFJs prefer to be at the helm of tasks or projects that can be seen through in a short time span, as it's easier to visualize what is needed from start to finish?

Any insights you all can provide regarding your preferences and the type of work you do best with would be helpful!",1614464140

ESFJ,"Hi!

I am very sad at the moment as I don't know how this happend but last night I was hanging out with my ESFJ friend and she is moving away very soon. I am INFJ and we got along so well the past 3 years and it was a good friendship but I always HATED the fact she never opened up more than she should.

So yesterday after 3 years of friendship she finally said it. "" You are too nosy, you need to stop being nosy I don't need to tell you everything about my life"" . As an INFJ these words hurt a lot because I have like literally 5 friends and I really want to know everything that is happening in their life but I know ESFJ's have tons of friends are are popular and don't really go to the depth of that kind of friendship but I thought we were actually good friends and I thought she was telling me most of her life events as I love to be a listener and try to put my input or help in anyway I can because that's what makes me happy as an INFJ.

I have always wished she would open up more. I have ESFJ male friends and they are always very honest, direct, open and tell me things. I tend to tell this ESFJ female friend a lot about my life, she knows my deepest insecurities, my deepest flaws , my aching heart being a hopeless romantic etc. etc. but it hurt me a lot to hear her say those words :(

Basically what led to this was she was selling some of her furniture and stuff and she said she sold it to one of our neighbours and I said Well who?  And then she dropped this bomb that I was being too nosy. I didn't ask the amount or how much she was getting I was just genuinely concerned who it was because some of our neighbours are sketchy people that will low ball the price in the end or claim that the stuff is faulty after breaking it etc. so I was only looking out for her. I tried to explain this to her but she wouldn't understand.

Another time this has happend but she didn't directly say that I was nosy was about her past boyfriend I was just curious because she knows about all my girlfriends till date but she won't open up about her past and it's strange because all my close friends know each others secrets and I think this is what a friendship is about we all help and support each other. However when she said ""She doesn't want to talk about it"" I never asked her again and I still don't know. I admit it would be nosy to ask if I didn't know someone for a long time but since I know her for 3 years now I thought she would open up more I would never ask a stranger this.

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly I am thinking to end this friendship now as she is moving away for good and I won't see her anymore next month but it really hurt to think these three years was just a fake friendship :( and I hate that as an INFJ I love loyalty and truthfulness.

I just don't know if I am actually being nosy but it was all meant to be a good way to help this person by knowing more about them because it's what makes me happy at the end of the day.",1614406403
ESFJ,"Please excuse my english, it's not my first language. I am an ENFJ. Recently I got close to one of my classmates, and she is an ESFJ. I am not sure if she likes me, or she is just very friendly.
She clearly gives me more attention than the other colleagues. She complimented me a few times. We texted a lot on different groups on consecutive days. She told me that she laughed till she cried when I was joking. She was not ashamed to say in public that I helped her with something. She initiates conversation regularly to ask me to help her with different things.
On the other side, she didn't tried to get us alone, just the two of us. She also didn't complimented my looks, or ask me about my love life. I don't know what to believe.

ESFJ," I had a crush on this guy last yr. I remember overhearing (though they didn't intentionally say it loud so I could hear them, I j heard them from across the classroom,) his friend ask him why he was staring at me (if he was doing it bc he liked me,) and he said that it was bc he was trying to figure out why I looked so sad all the time. He then glanced me over and said, ""Besides, I couldn't go out w her. She's average. 5/10."" He then looked at me for a few more seconds and said, ""Actually... below average. 4/10."" We were in freshman yr of hs.

But I'm wondering what his reasoning for staring the other times was. I remember he once like, idk, started staring at me when I was walking down the halls w a friend and he was w his friends and like we j both kind of stared at each other and I get the sense that he was like, maybe going to come up and talk to me? I felt weird bc he was w his friends, I almost got the sense that he was going to introduce me to them? He stared at me for like a while... I ended up walking away w my friend but idk what he wanted. And then I remember he stopped once to stare at me (but I was far away, talking to a friend when we were prepping for a track meet,) even though class had already started... he was j def staring at me while I was talking to her. And there are like 1 or 2 other incidents, what was probs his reasoning?

How our friendship began: 

months later years ago she started to initiate hangouts and meetups tho i knew she had group of friends.At first i wasnt quite sure what it was until i noticed through my observation that she was lonely  but i let her come see me. She introduced me her hobbies that she didnt reveal that much to her other friends and one of those is her love for video games.I played along although i wasnt interested in those types of video games.We also have the same interests when it comes to psychology and life events. Overall she was quite a funny person to be around with. Our conversation wasnt kind of one sided back then.

Around 2018, she would often call me through phone which i really hate because it was messing up with my frequencies but i didnt know how to respond without offending her. She would tell me ""it's very important"" and other manipulation tactics for me to readily respond to her when i knew for a fact that they werent that really important. I called her out in this and surprisingly she apologized that she was disturbing me and i suggested that we could talk about this through messenger.She again went to her old ways but i stood firm and maintained my boundaries.

We are still friends as of now but mostly our communication consists of video games that she likes although i told her that im not fond of discussing video games. She said it's no problem and if thats the case then we can just compare the outfits of the characters. There were times i had to change the topic because she was discussing them in detail like she had nothing else to talk about unless i change the subject. Whenever i bring up subjects (like todays news) outside her ""comfort zone"", she would respond harshly to those people involve in the news or she would reply in short sentences . I was like dont you have anything outside your preferences?  I mean i know theyre not her interests but she would go back and dominate the conversation.She has also made back handed jokes that i didnt like and i called her out in it. My friend has no sense of timing when it comes to initiating a concersation or making jokes.

There were also good things like when it was my birthday ,she surprised me with candies, postcards and chocolates. She is willing to listen to me if i have problems. 

My patience is running thin and i want to confront her but i dont want to hurt her either.

We are very cordial and formal, but 4 days ago we got super frisky and touchy. We are Christians, and she is very traditional and likes me taking the lead and all that. This night she did say (albeit lightly) that we should slow down, but I took it as a 'stop it, some more' kinda thing. 

It wasn't. 

and afterwards I asked her to be my gf. (she just about broke)

I was stunned cause there were somethings that she erotically mentioned that led me to believe that we were both in sync at that moment; we were to an extent but not to the extent that I thought.

We decided to start over -with boundaries.

Also, when talking to them, it's usually the same thing. However, I can subconsciously spot an ISTP from a mile away and I grow curious about them. I end up approaching them without my brain making any conscious decision-I've been looking for that in my life. I just want my instincts to move me.

I've only encountered two ISTPs in my life that really made me gravitate towards them. Both were taken. One seemed pretty rooted in their guy. The other wanted to talk to me after I left, but I left like a coldhearted SOB because I couldn't come into terms that I might have liked her/found her attractive-she mentioned in a conversation with her bartender friend that she had a boyfriend so... whatever. Long story that's not worth getting into-just take my word for it that I knew she was curious about me too.

People will question how I know they're ISTPs. All I had to do is see how they emotionally express themselves (and I see a lot of subtle facial movements-even when they're excited, their face barely moves and you're left with an excited voice; but not so much an excited face \[you have to really look into their eyes to tell\]), ask them questions to see what they're into (adrenaline-type/adventurous lifestyle), and look at their responses (simplifying what if/things that are of no relevance anymore).

This ESFJ thinks he's made best for an ISTP. Tough luck-granted female ISTPs are approximately less than 1% of the population. Also, there's a wide array of ESFJ hetero-male candidates out there. Unfortunately, I don't like to settle, and, I guess, that makes me a competitor-haha.

As much as I'd like to be, deep down, I'm not even close to a philanderer. I'm a committed to the bone marrow type of guy. I don't want to waste my time, and I'm not one to shoot for a goal in a game I don't want to play. It's funny because my friends think that I'm attractive enough to be the type to do so. I see the short-term reward, but the long-term play isn't there. Sex is a moment, but being with the right person is a lifetime. Although I'm a bit of a sprinter (I like to race bicycles and race cars), I prefer to play the long game.

Why I'm not attracted to other MBTI types:

1. **Extroverts** \- I don't have enough energy to keep up with Extroverted women period.
2. **ISFJs** \- I'm not enamored by their move as society expects attitude, level of stability (a bit too boring for me), and inconsistency with logic/reasoning and their emotions. They can be logically rigid, but then fall short because of soft spot (it's really annoying).
3. **ESFJs** \- Too many emotions-I already have mine to deal with. Can be a bit obnoxious. Gossips a bit too much. I also don't want someone overbearing/smothering. Also, sorry ESFJs, we're boring.
4. **ESTPs** \- Attractive, but lack depth.
5. **NTs**

* ENTPs - Their excitement over ideas drains me. I'm not ashamed to say that I can't keep up.
* ENTJs - Never met one, but I don't think we'd get off on the same foot anyways. I don't need another rigid person in my life. I also think I'd bore them since I'm definitely not *that* intelligent.
* INTJs - I think my personality can be a bit much for an INTJ. I also think I'd bore an INTJ, but am capable of surprising them (since I too can appreciate a certain level of theory and ideas).
* INTPs - Fun for a short time, but the relationship can be draining since it would be hard to keep up with that Ti and Ne combo. Again, I don't think I'm *that* intelligent.

1. **ENFJs** \- way too much energy and not something I can handle tbh. My ENFJ ex and I would butt heads every second.
2. **ISFPs** \- cute and attractive, but they fall short in the logic department and it sort of annoys me.
3. **ISTJs** \- Too stable and I don't need another rigid person in my life.
4. **INFPs** \- Cute, but can't trust them.
5. **ENFPs** \- Cool, but, from experience, are quite unstable. Also, too hippy for me.
6. **INFJs** \- I've encountered two. We definitely vibe, but I think we're better off as really good friends. One where I look out for them, but that's about it.

So why an ISTP?

They simplify life and simply live. Cut to the bullshit when it comes to critical thought-accurately analytical (sometimes). Have their flaws which I think I can come in to benefit them (if they so desire to let me help). They fly and they're free-free from constructs, free from bullshit, free from uniformity; free. I want to fly too, but I need a guide. I remember talking to my ex-girlfriend (an ISFJ), and I asked her, ""What do you want in life?"" Her response was simple, ""take care of my family, have kids, and a well paying job."" I was a bit disappointed because my response was, ""I want to be free.""",1613433332

ESFJ,"* Some of his biggest pet peeves include slow replies, betrayal, hypocrisy, people who won’t budge thinking they’re right even when what they’re saying makes no logical sense
* Cares a lot about how image and how he comes across to people. I believe this was mainly due to him having a huge falling out with his close friends because they insulted all his flaws. This made him more self-conscious about how people may perceive him. Regardless, he still always cared about his image though.
* He was controlling in group work, but I don’t know his reason. However, he self-admitted to liking power and said he feels destined to be a leader
* He has a history of doing bad things in high school such as spreading rumors about people he disliked, arguing with authority figures, and even kicking a coach, almost hitting his girlfriend at the time, and intimidating people
* A lot of the behavior I just described was because of his anger problems, which has gotten better over the years now that he’s older. However, he still has anger problems and may randomly explode like when he once yelled at a young student over her whining about food
* He wants to become a teacher so he can change the behavior and mindset of the new generation
* Can be quite manipulative and has even bragged about how good he is at manipulating people. He tends to brag about some other things too, but usually tries to do humble brags
* He says he’s an emotional person who prefers to openly speak about his sad feelings. He dislikes his parents because they invalidated his emotions, claiming men should be strong and not cry
* At the same time, he’s an objective person who said he gets stronger and more objective from each circumstance he faces. He uses logic to win arguments.
* In high school, he said he was detached from emotions to the point of his friends calling him too logical. He said he used anyone and anything for success 
* Helpful person who’s friendly and warm. He says he wants to please everyone, but he has a hero complex as well
* Although nice, he can be two-faced, judgmental, passive-aggressive, and defensive about what some people are saying. He also tends to “chameleon” people he meets and befriends.
* He’s still able to speak up about most things he has an issue with even though he claims he’s working on knowing how to speak up more when something makes him uncomfortable
* He says he’s a suspicious person who’s gray rather than black and white. He often is paranoid that people are lying to him about things.
* Cares to try to do the right thing or what’s moral
* He has really high expectations of women he likes but gets angry and criticizes them when they don’t meet his expectations. He desires a woman who’s confident, understanding, expressive, and logical
* Prone to being rash and worrying. He said he used to be afraid of responsibilities but likes that with age, you get more freedom. 
* He wants to live a carefree life where he can just do whatever he wants to do
* One of the things he fears is being useless 
* Competitive person who wants to be superior to others. He also is quite self-absorbed",1613012558

ESFJ,"I originally posted this on /r/INFJ but I wanted to do so here too.

So  after interacting with 3 confirmed ESFJ's that did the test and they  show the same behaviours I definitely feel like they are MUCH MUCH more  stable than ENFP partners why?

I  think once an ESFJ falls in love they do EVERYTHING literally EVERYTHING  they can to keep the relationship strong. They go out to do favours you  woudn't expect, they cook you nice meals, they tend to be the stay at  home kind of wives (Sorry ladies but this is what INFJ male's really  like since we are traditional!) .  They are extremely loyal and don't  fall out and in love very easily which makes them very reliable.  They  are also very sensitive and caring to the feelings of others , they can  feel what you are feeling and they will sometimes come out of the way to  just make you feel better.

I  don't mind my partner being needy because I am a person that loves to  help someone and if she needs attention I'll definitely give it, they  will remember everytime you helped them and they will help you or do  something back for you all the time. They leave nice little notes around  the house sometimes or give you genuine compliments.

Their  everyday aim is to give selfless love to everyone and make sure  everyone around them is feeling good and they thrive on helping others  (And this is exactly what I thrive on as well)

The  ENFP's are great but I feel sometimes they are way too much for me I've  met a lot of nice ENFP's but a pattern I've noticed with them is that  they are too jumpy from one relationship to another they don't care much  about the details they just need a partner and they fall in love too  easily making them a bit unstable for me (SORRY ENFP's but I really like  you otherwise). I also feel a lot of ENFP's show so many symptoms of  ADHD (I am not a doctor) and sometimes it's really hard to deal with all  the fluctuations and hyperactivity. They get easily bored!!

The  thing's I don't like about ESFJ's ? Sometimes it takes ages for them to  open up and gossip about themselves! They love to gossip about other  people and tell you everything about someone but they are so hesistant  to tell you about themselves because they feel it's a burdern to talk  about them and they should be only talking about you and your feelings!  ESFJ's need to learn to open up more.  Also to learn boundaries and not  be so controlling of people and what they do and learn that people are  different

How does an ESFJ relationship help an INFJ relationship?

Well  as an INFJ male I can say my female ESFJ friends bring out the best in  me. They bring me out of my shell and help me to be a more social person  and to get outside the house more! They also help me to understand that  I am loved. My ESFJ friends are very conservative and more like  traditional women who really care about families and love to bring up  kids which is great because as an INFJ male that's all I really want  stability and a good family value. They are also very girly which is  great and it's so nice to see them wear traditional chic clothes/nice  dresses (Again ladies if you feel offended reading this it's fine I  understand this is my personal opinion)

Again all this is generalizing and I know MBTI doesn't define a person but this is just my observation from my ESFJ friends!",1612365194

I can afford food and gifts which is what I work a lot for. I come home stressed and depressed and I come home to more food and her talking on the phone with her girlfriends. I know it's not a time issue as she provides emotional support to them all day. It's almost like the ESFJ thing to do is cook, clean, give sex and their duties are complete. Feels really shallow with no true connection ever happening. I would much rather come home to a messy house, my frozen dinner and her hugging me, coddling me and asking how my day went. I tried talking about it the ESFJs I'm with and it seems the behavior is fixed for a few weeks but then they just go back to the way they were. Important to note even me as an ISTJ who aren't exactly known for their empathy listen to her problems frequently when she's going through a tough time; however,  when I open up about mine ""oops, time to go!"".

I live in the US and it's just so crazy-making to see so many people just straight-up not care, including several of my closest friends. I've been friends with them for 18 years, I've planned countless birthday surprises, care packages, been there for them in every way I can. I feel as if I could not be more loyal. But they just continue doing what public health officials beg us not to do - throw and attend parties without masks, dine in restaurants indoors, fly domestically and even planned a trip to Mexico in April when none of them are likely to be vaccinated. It's hard for me to stay silent, I have occasionally spoken up to say hey, that's not a good idea, and sometimes I've gotten angry with them. As a result, I felt a shift in the way they treated me. They dismiss me, ignore me, and in some cases I even feel like I'm being gaslighted and manipulated. I took a break of several months and when I went back through those messages, I saw them disparage me and accuse me of being ""toxic"" (this actually came the most often from my sister, who is in this group chat, which makes it hurt extra). I feel like 18 years of being hands down their most reliable and giving friend has meant nothing next to their denial of this situation. Between my classic clear sense of right and wrong and my need to be appreciated, this is by far the most painful experience of my life. I eventually permanently left a group chat I'd been in with them for 10 years and unfriended them on Facebook.

ESFJ,"I have a really close ESFJ friend of mine who's constantly being taken advantage of. We have a bit of an age difference (he's 30 I'm 23) so I expect more from him being older. I have a soft spot for Si users (Si is a really hard function to have) and feel a need to stand up and protect them.

We we planned to hang out this weekend to play video games but he pushed back our meeting time because of a work situation. It wasn't a big deal to me because he bails me out all the time but when we met later he explained what happened. Essentially there was a scandalous situation that had absolutely nothing to do with him and lower ranking members (he's the vice president) we're too lazy to do the work and pawned it off to him. I was extremely annoyed that he just took it. He actually did the work. I knew he was a doormat but didn't think he was losing his weekends over it. Admittedly I yelled at him for taking orders from lower ranking members who are known for throwing their rank around and for being a doormat. He felt bad but I was just so angry that he lets himself get used by others I decided to take away his phone a computer so he could actually relax.

Despite his absence the situation resolved itself because the people actually did their own work. He thanked me later on for doing what I did and he opened up about how it's hard for him to say no to people. I'm still pretty mad about the situation. My mom is an ISFJ and she's the same way. I feel I need to stand up for these people but I'm not sure how much more I can do. He won't do it himself and I can tell it low key bothers him. I also don't want to seem like I'm bossing him around because I'm younger than him but he seriously needs to stand up for himself.

Idk if this is an Si problem, my INTP sister is also a doormat and all my Si exes were the same. It really boils my blood when people capitalize on each other. Sorry for the vent, I love you guys but man I get so heated with some of your actions.

It took me 3 years to get to 1600, and I hit the highest of 1600 I could ever hit during that time. Around that period, I stopped, and then thought I try my hand at it again. Then, I stopped again, and kept going. I took a 3 month break from the last time I played, and, eventually, I hit 1718 and then dropped to get back to 1700. My games aren't of great quality when you backtrack my games, but I wouldn't say I'm total poop.

Anyways, I'm pretty damn proud of my accomplishment, but I also, like I said once before... am retiring from the game. If anyone here is also an ESFJ and play chess. Please do share your experience. I started in college in my 20s, and, as I've said in the beginning, completely self-taught.

ESFJ,"So I want to be 110% completely honest in this post because I want to be proven wrong if I hold bias for un-logical reasons. But I just want to point out before anything I **do not hate** ESFJ's; just from my experience with them, we do not get along at all, and I want to understand why and see the other sides perspective. I want to be shown how I'm wrong? or if I'm being prejudice?

A bit of context; I'm an INTP who grew up in an extroverted family. My older sister is the biggest ESFJ out there, as well as I'd say 90% of my family, 99% of which I would easily classify as HEAVY extroverts. Literally the ""I need almost constant human interaction or else depression. Meanwhile, I'm on the COMPLETE polar opposite of the spectrum. 

I don't like weddings, I don't like family get togethers, I despise small talk, I don't care about gossip, I don't care about traditionalist values, but most of all I despise status among all else. Which from my experience seems to be a big issue with ESFJ's from my experience with them. 

Like I said, I'm not holding back how I truly feel. These are my biggest issues with the ESFJ type from my own experience literally being around them my entire life within and outside of my family. THIS IS NOT GOSPEL. AND NOT ALL ESFJ's ARE LIKE THIS. I just really want to understand for myself and others who feel these ways. 

**1.  ESFJ's seem unbearably vapid.** 

They just seem like clones. You follow the same traditional values, then just keep pumping them into the next generation to wash, rinse, and repeat. They don't want to hear about science, they don't want to hear about opposing views, they don't want to hear about philosophy. Just them them them. 

It's like the ""basic white girl"" trope, any semblance of personality they seem to have just seems to stem from others. They like what everyone else likes, because it's ""normal"" and ""popular"". Anything outside the wheel house of ""job, my kids, gossip"" is just weird and out there. 

So as an INTP who craves mental stimulus and originality, it's so unbearable for me to be around a type that just seems so unoriginal. I have other extrovert friends, other sensor friends, feeler friends, and judger friends, but for some reason when you put all 4 parts together it just becomes so... boring to me? 

**2. If you don't follow their way, you're judged for it.** 

I never enjoyed family gatherings as I've said, because it was just the same old questions over and over and over and over again. Even at 22 I still get asked the same shit, and whenever I want to change the subject they don't even want to. 

I'm ""weird"" for liking science, I'm the outcast family member because I chose to never have kids or have a wedding, and it's frustrating how this type is always told be consoling yet they seem so against progress and anti-traditionalism. 

**3. Sensitivity and lack of logic.**

THEY ARE NOT STUPID! Just to throw that out there. What I mean is they despise any sense of criticism and take it as a full-out attack. Tell them something might not be a good idea? your an asshole. I really just can't wrap my head around people who just don't want to learn or admit their faults. 

You don't want to come out to this event we KNOW you don't like? they hate us. 

It just... I don't get it. They don't need evidence to believe in things, they just DO. You just have a kid! forget the fact the world might not be the right place to have one, you just do it because that's what you do.  

**4. I don't feel like a person to them, I'm a tool to be used for energy and status.**

This is my biggest problem. ESFJ's seem so attached to this idea of social status which I think is THE MOST illogical, useless thing to even exist as a concept. I don't give a shit about any of that, and I have no idea why anyone else should. 

I don't feel like they even try to get to know me, they just want to be AROUND me because I'm a person, and the more people you know, the better somehow? 

I truly care and feel connected to all the friends I have, I would rather have only 1 really good friend than 100 fake ones. I don't feel like a person when I'm around ESFJ's, I feel like a battery, they don't want to hang out because they want to know ME, I feel like I'm just a tool to be used. 

**In conclusion** 

I don't want this post to be about me attacking or shitting on ESFJ's, I know there's probably plenty of ESFJ's who find INTP's stuck up, lazy, entitled, boring, etc. And if you do I would love to hear why and start a conversation about it. 

Which is why I'm making this post. I want ESFJ's to understand where I'm coming from in hopes to start a conversation or where I'm wrong. 

I will say I love my sister and my family, as much as we don't fit together. ESFJ's have a ""warmth"" around them I can't really describe? and my sister always made sure I was doing ok when I was growing up. 

Thank you :) from your neighborhood robot INTP.",1610828018

ESFJ,"As an ESFJ, I'm motivated and propelled by working with others. I feel like being so extroverted makes it hard to figure this out my career path, because I'm often more motivated by who I'm working with than what I'm doing. Working with others can sometimes make me like activities that I wouldn't normally enjoy, just because that interaction is so motivating and energizing. When I don't have enough interaction, I lose motivation and can even become sullen and despondent. I am not fulfilled in my job now --- should I go find a job doing this same thing, just in a more collaborative team environment? Or, do I need a different type of job, where interacting with others is more emphasized and ""alone"" work is a smaller portion of what I do?

(For reference, I work as an urban planner in a somewhat small organization. I'm wondering, do I stay in this field, just in a new environment; or, should I try an opportunity that involves less reading/writing/work on the computer and involves more direct interaction? Like.... how a chef or a nurse or a musician or a sales rep will spend more of their time with their hands or working with people than they would on a computer)",1610145010
ESFJ,"I'm currently living with roommates who, and I unfortunately have to use this word, are ""triggering"" me. One I believe is an ESTP- she is *very* opinionated, very good at arguing and is incredibly assertive, and loves working with her hands + is a bit of a daredevil type- and the other claims to be an ENFP but isn't sure. 

They get along really well with each other in particular, and I feel like I am constantly treated as the butt of all their jokes, or at least the person they take their frustrations out on. The ENFP is often snide/sarcastic towards me (and less so to the ESTP from what I know, although they argue sometimes), while the ESTP harshly reprimands little things that I do here and there (and rarely goes after the ENFP). The ENFP even once told me that they and the ESTP seem to just ""get"" each other somehow.

I've learned all the ""rules"" of the house that they set in place- ""don't do this because I don't like it, put this thing this way,"" etc.

 I try to be as nice and friendly as possible since I am so affected by conflict (especially because I have to \*live\* with these people...meaning there is no escape from them), but it feels like I am at my last straw. The ESTP is at least a little reasonable, and while can be suddenly rude af, I feel like they don't really upset me as much as the other person. The ENFP- I tried approaching them about their behavior, but they started talking down on me. And as I'm already super sensitive to criticism, I ended up apologizing and shutting down. 

This has happened to me in the past with many other people and I struggled to stand up for myself; I just end up apologizing in the end. I've already mentally cut the two of them out of my life- I no longer personally consider them as friends but just as roommates who I have to deal with until the end of the term, but of course I can't completely avoid them. I just want to be able to stop caring what they think, and other people who are similar to them.

ESFJ,"First off, I just want to say that I don't know why this type gets so much trash in the MBTI community. Literally makes no sense. Because there are so many false negative stereotypes about you guys, I'd figure I'd just ask you all my quesitons directly. I was prompted to do so because I think my sister is an ESFJ, but she's only 15 so it might be to early to call. 

What does inferior Ti look like, both when you are stressed and in your everyday life? Again, with the negative stereotypes people like to push the idea that inferior Ti means stupid, but I don't think that's what it is. 

How do you guys differ from ENFJs? I know that the difference is Ni-Se vs Si-Ne in the middle, but how do those differences actually manifest in real life?

This question is NOT meant to be offensive or reinforcing of the ""sheeple"" stereotype, I'm just trying to understand. Fe, from what I understand, is the function that is most concerned with social harmony. It's looking outwards.

I have a good friend I've known for 3 years now and she is ESFJ we get along very well but she is almost twenty years older than me which is cool because a lot of my friends are older and we all hang out.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway so my ESFJ friend is very very secretive about her life. I know what she does for work and about her current life but her past life is a mystery she doesn't talk about it (I mean in terms of her friends, relationships) but she talks openly about her loving parents and life she has lead.   


It's really strange because as an INFJ my nature is to fix things and help her but she won't let me in to know more about her but at the same time she wants to know everything about me and she asks me a lot of personal questions which I am happy to tell her because I trust her with everything and it's not so easy to trust people for me.  


I just want to understand her more so we can have a maybe deeper friendship than the one we have now :) and maybe help her to find a partner as well!!!!

ESFJ,"I'll share a formal energetics assessment that I conducted on Donald Trump. And the personality profiling result is the following...

Donald Trump is a SEE/ESFP in reverse development with main enneagram 8w7. NiTe subego (channelling Ni inspirations with Te methodics) pushed by a submerged Se Base frame. Fi fixation.

IRL dimensionality of valued functions:4D Base: Se (submerged), 3D Primary Auxiliary: Te (surfacing), 2D Secondary Auxiliary: Ni (surfaced), 1D Acting Suggestive: Fi (submerging)

On practical terms the resulting behaviour is an hybrid between SEE/ESFP and LIE/ENTJ. His strong tendencies of shaming and guilting others are an unhealthy expression of Fe Demonstrative. On top of that he has NPD.

Reversion is often triggered by trauma, depression and/or drug abuse. I suspect that in the case of Trump it was the latter to trigger the above reversion.

If you think that you can just cage the fluidity of human psyche in 16 boxes of stereotypes with all people following the same specific steps in development... And call it a day... You're delusional and you're vastly understimating the human psyche.

The human psyche is much more fluid and vast than systems like MBTI and socionics think it to be.

ESFJ,"\- She recently joined a sorority even though she never actually planned to join one because she wanted a fresh start in a new college with a new beginning. 

\- She said her sorority brought her out of her comfort zone, opened her eyes to new ideas, taught her to work better with others, and showed her what her own capabilities and independence are

\- Has an Only Fans where she doesn’t post nudes but does personal requests. Some strangers screenshotted thumbnails of her content in a folder and shared it with others publicly but she made a new one and is still posting there

\- Very active on social media; I believe she’s somewhat addicted to the validation and attention she gets from people praising her there.

\- She’s very easily influenced by the people she hangs around, getting into piercings and tattoos because her friends have them, liking raves because her friends attend them, etc.

\- Suspicious by nature, but gullible if she’s friends with them. She’ll be cautious and skeptical of people’s intentions and character; however if she knows them personally and they’re nice to her, she’ll be trusting of them and see everything they do in a good light.

\- Very insecure, constantly compares herself (especially her looks) to others, wants plastic surgery, nitpicks her appearance, and has body dysmorphia. However I feel like she needs validation, so she posts on social media a lot for compliments.

\- Ever since she was a preteen, she’d get anxious thinking about her future and the future in general.

\- Has anxiety, including social anxiety. She’s scared of many things such as her grades, quitting jobs, her own driving, transferring schools, changing her hair even though she wants to, paranormal things, the dark, and even eating jelly which is why she’s only had pb&amp;j once. She also gets paranoid over potential health issues, often self-diagnosing diseases.

\- She’s really scared of rejection and always wonders if she’s doing something wrong or annoying people. Another one of her biggest fears is disappointing her loved ones.

\- Extremely nice, kind girl but is easily taken advantage of. 

\- Used to be very shy and stutter a lot but has gotten out of her shell after joining her sorority.

\- Often speaks her opinions on twitter, saying things like how people need to learn manners or how she can’t stand people who count favors. 

\- She can be stubborn over some opinions, saying those opinions are right. 

\- Stresses how important it is to communicate issues

\- Quite sensitive and cries easily. She once talked about complicated customers interrogating her about the restaurant’s menu and while telling the story, her voice was getting shaky and her eyes were tearing up. She also wants to cry whenever someone raises their voice at her.

\- She said she always gets let down every time she’s happy, and she thinks that will never change. 

\- She’s quite open about her personal life with people

\- Can be impatient, sees herself as the most impatient person ever, and can have an attitude at times when she’s stressed or angry about something (ex: accidentally sassing friends/bf).

\- Hates when people are quick to judge. She won’t judge someone by their past or reputation until they show that they haven’t changed a bit.

\- Doesn’t enjoy continuously thinking about the past, but says that it just happens. 

\- Her school notes are extremely organized, color-coordinated, and decorated. She procrastinates a lot, but also studies very hard once she starts to the point of studying while cooking. 

\- She cares about making and saving money, but she also has bad spending habits. However she has more savings than other friends and people our age. 

\- She associates a lot of songs with memories and those songs make her feel a certain way. She also feels happy, sad, etc. whenever she sees Snapchat memories. 

\- Her friend (who she wasn’t close to) recently passed away a few weeks ago. She still thinks of him every day and all the memories they had together, and still gets sad on the daily. 

\- She has a hard time staying single and always wants to be in relationship. She likes hanging out with a lot of friends and enjoys going out with them.",1609392025

ESFJ,"my only sister is ESFJ and that is why I am here, everything I am seeing in this sub relates to her. Yes she is very unlikely to care about MyersBriggs, she once said she always gets boring anwers if she takes personality tests. And  she is even more unlikely to get majorly into reddit. 

She likes detective crime shows as they are more purpose driven. I hate detective shows as they are purpose driven rather then theme idea, concept driven. 

We have conflicted my entire life. I emotionally lash out at her. She manipulates others to gang up against me and shuns me. As no one sees her passive aggression, including her, they only see my emotional response, it means I always look like the problem. Which makes me smolder to melting point and look like more of an idiot when the emotion spills out.

She is comfortable  in displaying her emotions in away I am not. So she often reaches out and is comforted a lot sooner then I am. So that I spiral and hide when I am hurt, where as she reaches out and gets a hug straight away, and moves on and forgets about it.

I wallow in memory. I remember everything. I am nostalgic, I hold onto both cherished memories and hurt. She lives more practically in the moment. So the hurt I still feel over something she did, she can't even remember. 

I am fascinated by the dark sides of each type. As an ENFP my chances of becoming a cult leader, religious zealot are particularly high. I can also be impulsive, emotionally driven, disloyal, superficial and impractical. 

but when I read ESFJ's dark side it sounded like the side of her that only I am lucky enough (oh joy!)to be a part of. She is very kind and caring to everyone else, and sometimes even to me if I tred carefully. But mostly she shuns me, tries to make me feels excluded, bullies me and acts like its a 2 way sister teasing thing, but I never do that to her, if I did she would shun me. If we are alone and no one else is around she is fine. As soon as there is another person on the scene I begin to feel shunned and quietly bullied and ganged up on. It's so hard to talk about because no one else sees it, and I look crazy, because to everyone else she is not like this at all.

this is the dark side MB article I related to alot. both on myself as an ENFP and my sister ESFJ.

ESFJ,"Hi, first and foremost, thanks to all of you that'll take time to give their opinions on it.  


The story I'm about to tell is kinda old now but out of simple curiosity and because I cared despite not being able to show it I'd like some opinions on it.   


The story is kinda long but I'll try to shorten it ; Imagine you're a young 20 yo female ESFJ.   


Your first relation held during 4 years as a teen until you reached 20.   
During that last year you met an awesome 24 ENTP boy that was struck by lightning when he saw you (even if you were in the same high school and stuff but he didn't noticed you)   


During the span of that year you spoke with him nearly 364/364. Three months after the end of your first relation, you begin something with him. It's nice but you're at different state of your life, you want something stable that echoes your past relation and he has never been into a serious relation, is willing to commit slowly by slowly but cannot express it and pushes you away when he faces troubles. After 9 months he decides to break up with you because he knows you're suffering because of the situation but he's dumb af and cannot express emotions.   


After that, you kept a link seemingly hesitating between going back or not for six months (acting like you were just kind but showing interest, jealousy and hesitation to common friends)   


It never fixed itself but it was the longest time she stayed ""alone"" out of the 6 relations she ever had.   


So, I know it's weird, but I just wanted to know if that sounded like a coincidence or if you felt this was because the relation was ... meaningful ? It wasn't her longest, it was her shortest but all those relations that came afterwards, she found someone else 1 month max after it. Except this one.   


It won't change anything but I'm just  ..... wondering lmao",1608217350

ESFJ,"Hello,

I'll be honest- I've been feeling a bit down lately about my functional stack. I've grown up around thinker and/or intuitive types all my life, so I've almost constantly felt pretty incompetent. Currently, my roommates are an ENFP and ENFJ- and they're the type who can barely study for exams or go into a situation with very little knowledge, and still manage to do well. Meanwhile, I feel like I have to work much, much harder than them to even scratch that surface. So I guess I'm kinda feeling silly about being down on myself, and I want to focus on the positives.

ESFJ,"My city just went into a lockdown (again 😔) and now my boyfriend and I are at home all the time together. He’s an INTP. 

We’ve already well established that he needs his space and generally I’m pretty good about busying myself with other people and things to do. But now I’m on holidays and really there’s only so many zoom meetings I can have in a day with friends before *they* get tired too!! I feel like I’m hitting a wall because I know my social needs are not being met right now and it’s only going to get worse since this Christmas season is so depressing without being able to see anyone at all. Zoom meetings just aren’t the same compared to all the parties we should be having this time of year!!! 

But at the same time I really don’t want to start nagging my boyfriend (not that I ever mean to) because it stresses him out so much if he doesn’t spend the majority of the day just by himself. It frustrates me to know that he’s literally in the house and that we *could* be spending time together but we’re just not. Quarantine was hard enough the first time when all of this popped up back in March but now it just feels like it’s too much. Any tips on dealing with these issues?? Sorry for the little rant but I really needed to get that out of my system! And I don’t even want to talk about it with him because he always gets so annoyed about how often this comes up and he just really doesn’t understand why I have such a need for socializing!

I've decided to create this survey out of pure fun and inquisitiveness because I've been curious to know whether there are correlations between MBTI type and sexuality, particularly with sexual preferences and attitudes toward sex. I have a couple of guesses as to what kind of trends I expect to see in certain personality types, and of course, I'll analyze and post the results here and on [r/MBTI](https://www.reddit.com/r/MBTI/)

I'd be very thankful if you could participate, the survey should only take 1-2 minutes (or longer if you'd like to add some short responses). If any of you know someone who would be interested in taking this survey, feel free to share it with them.

My gf (ESFJ) and me are dating for 10 years now.
10 years and i still don't know what's up.

I just don't get it. What makes sense to you?

I can't explain stuff, i can't help. I can, but only when asked. I come up with amazing ideas that would end all discussions, in the most genuine way i can possibly imagine!

The solution was confirming the other persons view in a discussion, and only continue to make your own point until your partner is truly satisfied with what you think he meant. 

And i get a 'nope'. 
me: ""what do you mean nope? This is going to help us guaranteed! I promise you!""
her: ""No, i dont want to do that.""

I must confess i do like it tho. I like the confidence of just saying no. It doesnt matter what should or could be right. ""I don't give a fuck!"" (i know you do tho, but yeah..)

So, how do you want a partner to bring a new concept into your life? How do you want to be approached by your partner to solve deep lying problems?

Let me rephrase maybe; In what situation have you, in your past, accepted your partner's view or solution without it being a problem to adept to it.

That’s why currently (quarantine) I realized that I didn’t even try to think about my own emotions and how I generally feel about what’s going on around me. Of course I could tell what my hobbies are or whether I don’t like a certain type of food. But I just feel that there’s so much more than that. I realized I used to let the others define me as it would be a kind of role I have to play. I always went: “how would you describe me?” I’m not sure whether is it just me that finds trying to really know me difficult/annoying and I’m letting the others do the hard work for me or whether we all ESFJs just have terrible self perception lol.

ESFJ,"I'm an INFP and I'm having trouble with an ESFJ friend. Basically I'm not sure what he really thinks of me or if he's actually interested in being my friend, and I don't know if it's a good idea to try and bring up my issues to him or to just give up on the friendship. I find him agreeable to a fault, he's nice, but I've seen him turn against someone due to unverified gossip (it was a girl he dated, a mutual friend who is also INFP), and I know several people have gossiped about me to him. He said he defended me, but he only told me about it after I had found out from other people.

We've never had a real heart-to-heart conversation or even hung out one on one, I've tried a few times, I've even tried asking if he plays any video games we could play online, he plays League of Legends, but it never panned out. Despite that, he told his current girlfriend that he and I were best friends, which is one reason I believe he might not actually be a genuine friend. Since the pandemic started we've only seen each other once, at a mutual friend's birthday party. He spends most of his time with the girls he dates, but I also know he's hung out with other guys as well. 

When we met last year, I was in a very low point in my life, and I don't know if he realizes how much my personal issues affected my demeanor, and how much more there is to me when I'm in a healthier mindset (like I am now). I feel like he might've already made up his mind about me and decided that I'm not socially worth it. I've kind of already given up on him, though I don't necessarily want to. Do you think I could talk to him about how I feel, and if so, how should I word it? Thanks for reading.",1606767573
ESFJ,"Hi ESFJs,

I'm (M/22/ENFP) caught in a bit of a dilemma, and some help. One of my roommates (M/21/ESFJ) is really sad because he was playing a video game that was making him really frustrated. We usually play this game together for fun, but because the matchmaking system requires players in a party to be within a certain rank from each other, and he'd been losing quite a bit lately, causing him to fall out of the required rank for us to play together. He wanted to rank back up so that we could play together again (there's a normal mode in this game, but we both hate playing it because we're both competitive people), and ended up playing by himself. After losing a few more games, he told me that he's considering quitting the game, and I told him that it's okay to take a break from the game because in the end, it's just a game, and that it should be benefitting him, not making him feel worse. Normally, this would work, but all of my attempts make him feel better have been met with silence, almost as if he's zoned out to distract himself from everything. It makes me a little worried, because I haven't seen him like this in a really long time, and he only does this when he's really upset (his Fe is really strong, so he hates making other people feel his negative emotions).

I should also add that today's the anniversary of his grandma passing away, who he was really close with. I bought him a meal earlier (and promised to make it a yearly tradition to help him feel better), and bought him a new set of headphones because his old one was breaking down, which he came home to. He seemed really happy for a while, even waking me up while I was taking a nap so that we could eat together. But for the past couple hours, he's been completely unresponsive, and moody.

I'd appreciate any help that I can get. I hate seeing him sad, and want to comfort him in any way that I can, because I really care about him. What would be the best way to comfort him in this situation?",1606723078

i also notice that lately i know what i want but keep getting self conscious about the decisions i make. or i get worried about whether or not the things i want to do (if it involve another person) is ethically correct. that’s what happens when i get under stress.
another struggle i’ve always had is “what do i want? okay, how do i improve that? …do i want to do that?” if that helps as well.
i’m incredibly social and can read people and situations really easily.

ESFJ,"Hi! I recently took the 16 personalities test and got ESFJ. While I agree with much of it, there are some discrepancies and I wonder if I’m not taking the test accurately.

1) I don’t care much about fashion, social status and hierarchy, and while I follow most rules I’m not as much of a rule follower as the description states. I also like to mix things up and try new things.
2) I consider myself to be flexible and spontaneous regarding certain things. For example, I backpacked in Asia for 6 months with little plan and lots of adaptability necessary, and I loved it/would do it again any day. I enjoy Couchsurfing and going on random adventures, if it’s logical. 
3) I handle criticism averagely. I don’t love it, but I’m not as criticism averse as the description states.

However, it was accurate in terms of my interactions with others and productivity/efficiency with work.

So was I correctly categorized? The only thing I know for sure is I’m an absolutely an extrovert. Thanks!",1605758372
ESFJ,"So I’ve been a part of the MBTI subreddits for a few months now, and I’ve really enjoyed the memes, bouncing ideas off of y’all, talking about type, and whatnot. I think you guys will find this interesting.

I’ve started a YouTube channel based around this branch of psychology. One of the main things I’ve been doing on there is breaking down music/lyrics through the lens of type, and you’d be surprised how much there is to discuss when it comes to the functions (and how they interact) manifesting through songwriting.

If you aren’t interested, that’s cool. Obviously there’s no obligation. I’m sure it would bore some of you and interest others. People are different.

But I’m down to break down any songs you request. And if y’all are down for it, I’ll explore more of that artist’s music and make more videos on their library.

[Here are all the ones I’ve done so far](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKy9JfrMugrK29I52hYQNcwmoYi79_ePx)

As you can see, there’s a pretty big emphasis on NF. Most of the people who’ve subscribed so far are heavy NF fans, but I’ll continue branching out to other artists, and like I said, I’m open for requests.

Love y’all. Take care.

# ESFJ and ISFP is Socionics contrary relationship Description

These are relations of an unstable psychological distance. Both partners experience difficulties in establishing and keeping a stable psychological distance between them. The only chance Contrary partners have to get on together well with each other is if they are left alone. In other cases partners usually compete over their strong sides. The reason for this is when somebody else is present, each partner tries to capture the attention of the listener by showing off their strong side. Contrary partners may like some elements of the other partner’s behaviour. This often helps the partners to begin a more close relationship. However, when they are in company, their interaction can change dramatically. The introvert partner usually becomes distant, relations lose warm feelings and become formal and cautious. Both partners may start regretting that they became too trustful.  
The extrovert partner normally gets the false impression that the introvert partner is deliberately acting against them. This can bring a great deal of misunderstanding and surprise into these relations, as both partners are convinced that before everything was fine. The introvert partner usually starts suppressing the activity of the extrovert partner and may reproach and criticise them. The extrovert partner in return can behave in the same way.  
The most vulnerable position in these relations belongs to the extrovert partner, who may feel as if they are being betrayed. As a result the extrovert partner could start to worry excessively about their next step so as not to make any mistakes and may therefore become very suspicious. Unfortunately the extrovert partner cannot see that their introvert partner is not as bad as they have begun to imagine.

# Relationship Guide

**Communication**  
**How can ISFP and ESFJ types communicate effectively with each other?**  
ISFP and ESFJ personalities both possess the Sensing and Feeling traits, meaning they are present-focused, conscientious, and enjoy communicating emotionally. However, ISFPs are also more reserved and adaptable, while ESFJs tend to be charismatic and organized. ISFPs should listen to and connect emotionally with ESFJs, while ESFJs should give ISFPs space to be alone when needed.

**Resolving Conflict**  
**How can ISFP and ESFJ types resolve conflict?**  
Since ISFPs and ESFJs are both Feeling personalities, they should address conflict by sharing how they feel and showing sensitivity to the other’s emotions. Though neither type enjoys addressing conflict, it’s helpful to keep in mind the benefits of fixing a tense situation. To avoid some of the stress, ISFPs should share their perspective honestly, rather than keeping it to themselves, while ESFJs should be conscious of ISFPs’ need for personal space, allowing them to be alone and process if conflict becomes too tense.

**Working Together**  
**How can ISFP and ESFJ types work together?**  
ISFPs offer open-mindedness and flexibility to a workplace, while ESFJs bring energy and organization. ISFPs can help ESFJs adapt to unexpected circumstances, while ESFJs can help ISFPs accomplish their personal goals.

**Dealing with Change**  
**How can ISFP and ESFJ types deal with change?**  
Due to their Perceiving trait, ISFPs tend to naturally accept new situations. ESFJs may struggle a bit more with change, as it interrupts their plans. ISFPs should help ESFJs process and understand change by encouraging them to create a new plan or routine, which may provide ESFJs with a necessary sense of control.

**Managing Stress**  
ISFP and ESFJ types need to seek to understand what brings stress to the other type and should try to avoid causing it when possible.

**ISFP types are easily stressed by…**

* Complex and hypothetical ideas
* Repetitive schedules and routines
* Criticism from those they value
* Large groups of unfamiliar people

**ESFJ types are easily stressed by…**

* Harsh criticism from others
* Being forced to make quick decisions
* Communication that lacks connection
* Lack of quality time with friends and family

ISFPs should avoid being too last-minute with ESFJs; instead, they should try to make loose plans in advance, so ESFJs can set expectations.  
ESFJs can help ISFPs by spending one-on-one time with them to connect emotionally.

**Encouraging and Motivating**  
ISFP and ESFJ types can encourage and motivate each other in their personal and professional lives.

**ISFP types are motivated by…**

* Unexpected and exciting experiences
* Learning about how things work
* Creating something new and beautiful
* Connecting with close friends and family

**ESFJ types are motivated by…**

* Unexpected and exciting experiences
* Learning about how things work
* Creating something new and beautiful

ESFJ &amp; ISFP is not ideal match.

This is observation, experience, analysis.

&amp;#x200B;

2020/11/14 Post update: Complemented the deficiencies of the post.  
urgently notifying you because the wrong information has been leaked in Google search.

I’m ready to respect them even if they disagree.Google’s personality page says, “ESFJ’s natural partners are ISFP and INFP.” That’s actually wrong.In the theory of Socionics, ISFP and ESFJ are the contrary relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

1. There is no function (function corresponding to strength) within the four categories of psychological function, so it cannot be supplemented. 

&amp;#x200B;

In sociology, complementary relationships are called good relationships, and relationships with completely different personalities, that is, relationships that do not match psychological functions, are called bad relationships. And it can be explained logically that they cannot complement each other. First, the psychological functional pecking order classification is from primary function to quadratic function.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Each other's deficient functions and strengths should be the same. And that means it has the same psychological function. Otherwise you can't make up for it.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You can't make up for it if you're out of the category. This is because functions outside the category are from 5th to 8th functions and cannot be supplemented because they are functions that do not have strong functions. Each other's deficient function and each other's strength function should be the same. And that means it has the same psychological function. Otherwise you can't make up for it.

&amp;#x200B;

Psychological function of ESFJ (harmonious)

&amp;#x200B;

Primary function (dominant function, highest ability): extroverted emotion (Fe)

&amp;#x200B;

Secondary function (a function supporting primary function): Introvert sense (Si)

&amp;#x200B;

3rd function (a little bit less, but soon more usable when developed): extrovert intuition (Ne)

&amp;#x200B;

Quadratic function (too low function=too low critical weakness): Introverted thinking (Ti)

&amp;#x200B;

​

&amp;#x200B;

Psychological Function of ISFP (Artistic)

&amp;#x200B;

Primary function (dominant function, highest ability): Introverted emotion (Fi)

&amp;#x200B;

Secondary Function (a function supporting primary function): Extrovert sense (Se)

&amp;#x200B;

3rd function (a little bit less, but soon more usable when developed): Introvert intuition (Ni)

&amp;#x200B;

Quadratic function (too low function=too low critical weakness): extroverted thinking (Te)

&amp;#x200B;

​

&amp;#x200B;

2. In the theory of social personality, ESFJ and ISFP are  contrary relationships. In other words, they belong to a bad relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

3. Personality is different because the functions are different. This difference can cause many conflicts.

&amp;#x200B;

The two types are the exact opposite of the psychological function of personality. Psychological function is the function of the mental class representing personality, and therefore the personalities of the two are the opposite.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Therefore, it is no exaggeration to say that the opposite relationship is true in sociopathic theory. Their four functions are all the opposite, so their minds and values are different. This difference is likely to cause many conflicts. And there is nothing in common because psychological functions are all contradictory. Also, their psychological functions can misunderstand and distort each other's thoughts because of different languages.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

  
**What to keep in mind**  
Just because you are close to each other is not a good relationship, and looking like a compatible relationship is not a good relationship.The best relationship is consensus and complementary.

**It** is not a good relationship if they are close but cannot complement each other. It’s not a helpful relationship.This is what they say, but there is always a close relationship with each other even when they fight a lot.",1605359490

Their psychological functions, introverted Feeling and extroverted Feeling, are very likely to be conflicted due to different ways of thinking, behavior, and understanding.The nature of the two functions is reversed.

Also, they are not complementary and have seen a lot of fights that have actually fought. I have also seen successful relationships.Well, ESFJ and INFP? I think I’ve seen a lot of their unhappy relationships.

Even though they are actually in a good relationship. It’s just like a medium level relationship. They don’t seem to have a good relationship. ESFJ and ISFP are ideal Pair in the golden pair theory. It’s an obvious logical error and it’s wrong information. The reason is explained in the article.

ESFJ,"Ohhh the stereotypes of ESFJs being stupid. Or unoriginal. Not true.

Why? Because *Cognitive Functions* exist!! And, about 50% of people have their saviour functions as their dominant and tertiary rather than their dominant and auxiliary.

This means some people use their tertiary function more than their auxiliary one! That means some ESFJs are mistyped as ENFPs, like my best friend! He has very high Fe and Ne. His jokes are original and he just lights up everything. His Si overrides when it comes to adaptation to new things coming along.

The point is, ESFJs have Ne, and even if they don't use it often, they know what is and isn't original when they put the time into their passions.",1604811350

ESFJ,"Hello,

One week ago, I've met a esfj through OLD. We just had one date, but we meshed well. We have been texting since then and planned a second date. However, my country entered a national lockdown for at least one month, possibly more, so everything is in pause. 

Since then, she has continued to text me many times a day, often answering my texts in a few minutes. It starts to become suffocating for me. I'd be totally down to do this with a partner, but we have just met once and I fear that if we continue for one month or more, we may both have a totally false idea of the other person when we met again. Plus, there is no guarantee they the second date goes well at all, so I don't want to invest too much time and emotions in a distance text relationship so early. I've done that in the first lockdown, and it was a total failure when I met the person irl. 

Therefore, I'm looking for how to tell her that I'd prefer not too chat too much by text, and that maybe we resume or restart after lockdown when we have the chance to meet again. 

I'm an entj, so I would typically just say it directly and frankly, but I've learnt by experience that esfj can interpret it badly and be hurt. I don't want that. Any advice on how I should formulate it?",1604242337

ESFJ,"Hi! Just wanted to hear some input regarding an ESFJ I've been talking to.

I am a very true to word, INFJ female, and recently matched with an ESFJ male on hinge. We have only been texting for awhile, as he is currently across the country, and will be coming back in about two weeks. When we first started talking, I actually was the one who initiated the conversation, but since then, he seemed to love to carry the conversation. He has a very traditional sense of gender responsibilities, which shows through when we are talking. He has told me he wants to take care of me, bring me to travel all around the world with him, and many more sweet things, which to be honest, is moving a little fast for me and scares me a little. But I have yet to meet the man, so I don't want to jump into any conclusions, and I'm just taking everything with a grain of salt. 

We have been texting everyday since we've matched, but about a two days ago, after our nightly messaging, he hasn't texted me since. I texted him in the middle of the day, just to check in (as he is usually the one that initiates in the morning), and he left me on read late that night. I haven't texted him since, because maybe he is preoccupied with something, or maybe I am just overthinking. But I have never dated or talked to a known ESFJ male, so could I get some input on this please? Should I text him, and just ask him if I did something wrong? Should I give it a couple of more days? How should I proceed?",1604080011

ESFJ,"So, I'm an ISTJ and I'm pretty sure she's an ESFJ, but she's very manipulative and I have depression so our views usually clash and we fight. The first problem is that whenever that happens she tries to manipulate me into thinking I'm a terrible daughter because I shouldn't want to kill myself, I'm lucky, bla bla bla bla (she doesn't acknowledge I have a mental illness) and I'm really just getting sick of all this. The second problem is that she talks behind my back about me to my ISTJ dad and she basically makes him believe it's all my fault and that I'm a terrible person (and acts as she's the victim). Honestly, we are both very unhealthy (emotionally) but her efforts to hurt me are making me go crazy. Please, if anyone has any tip on how to deal with an unhealthy ESFJ, I'd very much appreciate it &lt;3",1603888883
ESFJ,"Hi. 
ENTJ (m) happily married to an ESFJ (f) for more than 23 years. Have been together fir 30 years. Most of the time we get in fabulously well and would say we have a healthy, happy marriage and hardly ever argue.

We get into a spat maybe once or twice a year max but the frequency has risen during lockdown.

She is extremely caring, loving and considerate 99.999% of the time. Very rarely, I find her being being unfairly critical of me. For example she will criticize the things I do or say far more than anyone else in the family or our circle of friends.

When I bring this up, rather than a quick acceptance / apology and moving on (which is what I think I would do), she goes into a long defensive stance (lasting literally hours and sometimes days) to *prove* that I am in the wrong and unjustified. I typically give up and accept that she wont ever give an unconditional apology.

What advice would you give me?
Why is it so hard for her to accept she might be in the wrong/ has done something that has come across as inadvertently inconsiderate?

Is the unwillingness to apologise typical?",1603883855

ESFJ,"So guys,
let‘s cut short. I have watched a video and been binging on mbti related material for a few years now. I typed as Intp almost always in tests, but here is the thing i often switched or switch characters. I played roles a few times in my life not in a sociopathic way but more in a way of finding myself. And i am always finding myself in an identity crisis every now and then. When i go to out or basically in anything i do, i have a mantralike behaviour? Like for example in one week i am more focused on the mantra „be responsible and be strong“ than i act like that and change my behaviour a little bit to fit into that. Some time after i have the mantra „be giving“ and i act like that though it is not random but it emerges from one to another and depends on the influences from outside and what i experience with that mantra, until i am on a quest to find the truth again.
Any thoughts?
I also thought about me being and entp. But as far as several youtubers go they tend to be more proactive about social atmospheres.
If i‘d be an isfp, you guys should theoretically be my counterpart and maybe can guide me.

Greetings",1603643884

Since I’m here doing this, might as well take the time to say that my sister is ESFJ and she is an amazing human being. For those curious, she teaches 2nd grade at California School for the Deaf—she is hearing, but majored in Deaf Studies. She is dating an ISTP, and they’ll probably get married someday (I hope so; he’s awesome). I feel incredibly lucky to have her as a younger sister.

ESFJ,"ESFJs get an undeserved bad rap of being shallow, gossipy, and insincere, but that couldn't be further from the truth. ESFJs are often the most kind and invested people in any given situation. You guys have this gift of finding the right words in an emotionally charged situation and as an ENTJ, I envy that. How can someone who can barely manage their own emotional needs tend to those of others? 

ESFJs are some of the kindest, most persistent, and (gasp) *smartest* people I know. I mean that. Nothing gets in the way of an ESFJ using their intellect to help others. Us ENTJs often resort to displays of force to get our point across. Most ESFJs don't need to do that. You guys innately know how to lead with gentleness and compassion. That's something I wished I learned earlier.",1603072223

So yeah, was wondering how you all deal with grieving.",1603017517
ESFJ,"Just an ENTJ here. I’ve observed a certain trait that seems to be specific to ESFJs, and was wondering if any of you actual ESFJs could explain it. You guys seem to have a tendency to talk a LOT and almost talk over people from time to time. I haven’t seen this behaviour in ENFJs, so I don’t think it’s an Fe thing. It’s strange because on paper, I wouldn’t associate a dominant Fe user having that kind of bad habit since Fe is all about social cues and stuff. Anyone have any ideas why this happens? And whether or not you can relate. Thanks!",1602978914

ESFJ,"· She will do anything and everything you want her to do and she often will go along with whatever you want and even agree with your preference on something even if she didn’t initially.

· Gets nervous extremely easily for things like presentations, interviews, and performances to the point of getting an upset stomach. However if her friends are also nervous, she’ll do her best to try to uplift their spirit with positivity and hype them up to boost their confidence.

· Very forgiving person who gets over things quicker than most people do. She once had a legal situation happen involving someone close to her betraying her by getting her to lend him a huge sum of money (talking thousands), just for him to use it all up and lie about what happened. Although most people would either sue or at least expect repayment, she let it go because she didn’t want to cause his situation to get any more difficult for him and wanted to keep things as peaceful as she could.

· Super hardworking and ambitious when it comes to her dreams and what she’s passionate about. She practices for things until very late at night and even while brushing her teeth, she continues to practice

· Took a huge risk moving to another country at a young age without knowing how to speak the language because she wanted to pursue her dream career in that country

· Big spender; often spends on many items while shopping and when stuck between two choices, she chooses to buy both

· Enjoys sleeping all day, watching Netflix, and staying home to play with her cats. If she does go out, it’s usually to eat at a restaurant or take photos with her various cameras.

· Believes it’s important to make sure you know what you really want to do and do it because if not now, then when? She thinks you should push forward with what you want to do.

· Makes the most out of things, has really great positive energy, and has a very radiant smile that makes other people smile just by looking at it. 

· Hardly ever gets angry and never yells at people. Typically just stays quiet if she’s mad.

· Not good at verbally expressing how she feels, but is a very emotional person who cries at many things including movie scenes where she doesn’t even understand what’s happening

· Often will try not to cry because once she does start crying, it takes her a long time to stop. However she’s not good at holding in her tears, especially once she sees something touching or when she sees another person crying.

· She’s a really shy person, but is also bubbly and cheerful. You won’t catch her feeling sad often. She gets especially shy with crushes and embarrasses herself around them easily.

· Really generous with people she cares for. She once gave a dance instructor fruits and said she had to hurry before the fruits lose its freshness.

· She has a really good memory, especially if she sees it. She also can remember things you tell her about yourself quite easily.

· Enjoys making jokes and teasing her friends. She’s also really easygoing, so everyone loves making fun of her and joking at her expense because she never takes it seriously.

· She has worries about things like not being a good role model for the younger people around her like nephews and nieces. Although everything finds her great, she often has thoughts in her head like if she isn’t doing something good enough or if she messes up and looks bad for those around her, etc.

· When asked about her wishes, she said she wishes that the people she loves are healthy, hoped that she can experience new things in the future, and be happy with the people she’s with now for a long time",1602916468

ESFJ,"Hey ESFJs! I'm Derek (ENTJ). A few months ago, my friends and I created an MBTI-based dating/friends app called Boo. Some of you may have already heard of it (and know that our first version was actually barely usable). I wanted to let you know about it because we've made a lot of improvements since then and thought you'd be interested in trying it out.

Like many of us, we're hardcore MBTI lovers and enthusiasts and thought it strange that no MBTI app existed yet. We thought MBTI could fix a few problems with current dating apps.

For one, you are recommended people you’re statistically likely to love and understand effortlessly, instead of being forced to meet every single type of person. Second, you can save time, money, and emotional fatigue you would have spent on bad dates with no chemistry on other dating apps. Third, you can deeply understand each other’s personalities before you meet and in a way that was never possible before. And fourth, get in-depth dating advice and insight into how to attract and get along with anyone.

[Boo Telepathy Demo](https://i.redd.it/x23685kecvs51.gif)

Many of our users are using the app to make friends and foster deeper, more meaningful connections. We pretty much built this app for people like us, so I'd love to get your feedback on how we can make it better.

The app is completely free to use, with added features like Dating Telepathy that are part of a premium membership (to support our operations).

You can download the app through the Apple App Store and Google Play Store links on our website: [https://boo.dating](https://boo.dating/)

ESFJ,"This is a sample of the body language signals that you can usually see in a LIE/ENTJ: 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgKhbQkJeeg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgKhbQkJeeg)

For the analysis I used as an example the ex-pornstar Sasha Grey (LIE/ENTJ 3 sp/sx 397) talking in an interview. Sasha Grey is one of the few LIE/ENTJ women around (LIE/ENTJ and ILI/INTJ are the rarest types in women)

Whilst VI is useful, keep in mind that the body language can be controlled at will, modified by moods as well as it can be susceptible to feedback when interacting with others. Most individuals don't know how to control body language and/or they will usually resort to using the default body mannerism as it's the least energy expensive option. 

Anyways counter-check the information metabolism by IM/functions slots just to be sure:

\-------

LIE/ENTJ

Ego block: (- Te) 4Dv Base/Dominant, (+Ni) 3Dv Creative/Parent.

Superego: (+ Si) 1Du Vulnerable/Trickster, (- Fe) 2Du Role/Demon.

Id: (- Se) 2Dv Mobilizing/Child, (+Fi) 1Dv Suggestive/Inferior. 

Superid (+ Ti) 3Du Observing/Nemesis, (-Ne) 4Du Demonstrative/Critics.

Socionics quadra: Gamma (world rejecting, integrity seeking).

(- Te) = Business logic of risk and entrepreneurship. Rejection of which is useless, insignificant, mundane. This aspect is valued as more important than accumulation and rational consumption. 

Hidden agenda: 2Dv Se Mobilizing/Child (to be wealthy)

ESFJ,"Hi fellow ESFJ friends (and lurkers),

I identify with most of the ESFJ traits, and would say that I have a wide circle of people I care for and consider friends.

I do feel sometimes however, that I give more than I get back. I don't mean to sound ungrateful, but sometimes I feel perhaps I confuse connection and care for someone as friendship when in actual fact, it's just me being their support. I think as an ESFJ, I want to help and support my friends but it often feels one-sided.

So I wanted to ask the rest of you what your thoughts were. Do you think I'm feeling this way because I'm seeking validation? Do any of you feel similarly with your friendships?

I'm also curious about your friendships - do you also have lots of friends/acquaintances, or do you only have a few close friends?",1602504590
ESFJ,"Just wanted to gush about my ESFJ boyfriend! I would say that he fits the ESFJ stereotype pretty well. He’s such a natural caregiver! He takes such good care of me! How do I even express my appreciation in words? He often surprises me with my favorite snacks such as chopped strawberries and whipped cream and tucks me into bed before my naps. And my love language just happens to be acts of service! He’s amazing beyond words—and not just with me. He’s also really caring toward his friends and his younger brothers. Everybody loves him and with good reason. And he’s got so much social energy compared to me, an INFP. Our dynamic is so funny! I’ll panic about the latest inconvenience in my life, and just hearing his calm voice soothes me. He’s so mellow yet energetic. Does that make sense? He’s very down-to-earth while I live in my head. He really grounds me. Nobody—and I mean nobody—can handle me like he does. Is patience a common ESFJ trait? It’s like he was born with it. He’s such a gem...

ESFJ,"As a preface I want to say I know we are not supposed to type children as things can change as they grow.

Ever since I've gotten into MBTI I've been watching my son to see if a pattern would arise in his behavior, and maybe I can get an idea as to what his type would be. I am an ESFJ and my husband is an ISTJ, but we are both very affectionate parents. He is going to be eight soon and his personality is really apparent at this point.

He loves hugs and kisses. He *always* wants to snuggle or at least be in close proximity to someone else. He is the first one to go talk to other kids, when we pull up to the park he will exclaim, ""My friends are here!"" Even if he doesn't know any of the other kids. He's also still a big hand holder and loves to just be close to people.

I have converted my closet into a ""zen"" room that has a bunch of hanging plants, my orchids, a wax melter, and a super soft and plush rug. I like to go in there just to unwind and be still. Sometimes he will come in with a pillow and a blanket, and ask to cuddle and chat. He is always asking if we are okay, or when I'm upset he wants me to talk to him about it. 

At this point if he continues down this path I'm convinced he will come out to be an ExFJ. The extroversion part is absolutely apparent. He will talk to anyone and everyone, loves to be the center of attention, and has no problem saying what is on his mind. Occasionally when he leaves a room my husband will say, ""It feels like a hurricane rolled through here."" 

The J for the fact that he craves organization and structure. If someone in his class is doing something wrong he will be thr first one to tell them to behave. (We've told him to leave that to the teachers lol) He always wants a time frame on events and is big on planning things with my husband and I. If things go awry he has a difficult time rerouting his ""gps"" to fit the changes.

I’m naturally inclined to think it’s the latter since I don’t think these sorts of things are exclusive to certain types, but I thought it would be interesting if other ESFJs went through something similar.

I really didn’t think I was upset and thought we were all right...until the next day when the emotion of anger just sort of hit me like a tidal wave and I realized that I was actually upset at my friend. 

In the second case, I was trying to reconnect with someone I had a very, very messy friendship with—he wronged me, I distanced myself and then because of that he thought I wronged him, and then I just blamed myself severely for the fallout. I thought I just wanted to prove to myself that I could be “normal” and “myself” around him again. And I think this was definitely a genuine part of my feelings. But after reaching out and seeing the tepid response, I felt very disappointed. I then realized that this entire time I was probably also hoping I could just fix things and repair the broken friendship.

ESFJ,"I (19, F, INFJ) have been dating a (18, ESFJ) man for 3 months. Things have gone really good between us in terms of communication as that’s one of his strengths. However, he left for college last month which has put a strain on our relationship. His school is only 30 minutes away so distance isn’t the problem. It’s his desire to be friends with as MANY people as possible. I’m really glad he’s formed some relationships at school and it’s good he has a life of his own but sometimes i feel like he takes me for granted as he has been exposed to all these new experiences and people. We try to see each other once during the week, and once on the weekend but he was insistent on playing intramural volleyball with his group of guy and girl friends every Mon-Thurs from 6-10 pm which takes a lot of time away from hanging out together. He has tons of girl friends that I get insecure and jealous about yet he doesn’t seem to understand where i’m coming from. He is quite arrogant at times and knows people like him. Sometimes it makes me feel as if i’m not enough for him. I am completely devoted to him and i know he wouldn’t cheat, but how can i express how i feel to an ESFJ in a way they understand? We have had brief discussions but usually he’s just like “Well you knew this would happen when i went to school.” He can deal with not seeing me for days at a time and i’m very attached to him.

ESFJ,"Hello everybody, I was just reading this interesting book titled ""The H Factor of Personality: Why Some People are Manipulative, Self-Entitled, Materialistic, and Exploitive—And Why It Matters for Everyone"" which talks about a newer personality model called the HEXACO. The HEXACO is basically the same as The Big Five, except that it adds another factor for honest-humility. I was curious if there is any correlation between MBTI type and HEXACO results, so if you guys are willing could you take the official HEXACO test here [https://hexaco.org/hexaco-online](https://hexaco.org/hexaco-online) and then post your number (not graphical) results below (you can download your results in pdf format and when you do that it gives you actual number values, instead of just a graph). I will be posting this in all of the different MBTI types' reddit channels to get an idea of how each type differs in HEXACO results.

ESFJ,"I will show you exactly which type Chase Joseph Simonis is. He isn't an ENTP as he claims to be, neither an ESTJ as some people mistype him to be.

First of all let’s compare his body mannerism to Charles Manson.

Charles Manson:

[https://youtu.be/YxxH6xm\_ZVg](https://youtu.be/YxxH6xm_ZVg)

Chase :

[https://youtu.be/gHWCn5-EWkQ](https://youtu.be/gHWCn5-EWkQ)

As you noticed, their body mannerism is identical… Do you know which type is Charles Manson? Charles is an ESE/ESFJ. Vultology wise you would classify both Charles and Chase as FeSi Directive I-I- with flat affect (at the current level of development in the above mentioned videos).

I used Charles Manson as an example to get my point across, but you  ESEs/ESFJs can try comparing your body mannerism with Chase and you’ll see my point.. One of my parents is an ESE/ESFJ… Same body mannerism as them. 

Let’s counter-check his functions just to be sure, because vultology is an interesting tool but cognitive functions reign supreme when it comes to typing.

Nova and Grimm, two former mods of his, released a series of videos backed up with proofs on their discord server, about the true behavior of Chase. The way that he acts on video and how he acts on real life? Extremely different.

This is one of their videos. I invite you to see all of them, so you get an idea of whom you’re dealing with 

[https://youtu.be/rOw\_OHzZT2s](https://youtu.be/rOw_OHzZT2s)

*(1:14-1:55) &lt;&lt;He had zero schedule. Like that was why I was gonna be hired on... It's the fact that the dude couldn't schedule to save his life. Quite literally kept on calling me being ""Oh my god I'm gonna die of stress because of my scheduling. And you really got to start  working for me soon because of this"". No seriously, the dude cannot abide by a schedule. You make him schedules unless you hound his ass to keep that schedule. He is not gonna keep it and he is just going to do what he wants to do anyway.&gt;&gt; (Nova about CS Joseph)*

That’s not a signal of Te Leading/Base user. That’s the signal of a Fe Leading/Base (first slot in MBTI) with Te Role (eight slot in MBTI)

Te Role: *“It is manifested as a need to appear efficient, productive and knowledgeable in their endeavours, as long as that does not conflict with priorities set up by their base function Fe. For instance, they may end up defending a decision or action that is not the most efficient but it is the one they see as most desirable in order to achieve or maintain the emotional atmosphere they are aiming at (for instance, not be seen as hostile to a given person or group).”*

Which, in Chase’s case, the main priority is to keep his cult active and receive their adulation. As well as to milk them out of their money whilst not providing adequate  services in exchange. 

Chase occasionally engages with Te Role, often negatively when he is anxious. That’s why he can give at times ExTJ vibes. When a Fe Leading user engages in Te Role, their warmth is temporarily turned off as Base and Role cannot be turned on at the same time *(they represent opposite ways to the same goals).*

Chase is horrible at typing, not taking properly in account enneagram for basic motivations and that MBTI/socionics covers information metabolism *(it’s not an automatic skills detector).* Chase uses stereotypes a lot, making a quick decision about what he feels it’s the personality type of someone and seeking biased information to confirm his initial feeling. That’s congruent with unhealthy Si Creative (second slot in MBTI) in an ESE/ESFJ, relying only on own personal experience and disregarding others’ experience plus being closed minded at the same time. That’s why, if you don’t fit his stereotypes, he’ll immediately attack you claiming that you’re mistyped when it’s not necessarily the case. And, if you decide to have a coaching session with him, as pointed by his ex mods he will listen to you just a few minutes at max, then he’ll bully you into thinking that you’re a certain type. 

As confirmed by Nova and Grimm, Chase lacks the sense of timing in planning. For instance rather than increasing slightly and progressively the price of coaching to deal with overbooking in that period, he immediately doubled the price of his coaching. Which, as they pointed out, it killed the amount of coaching requests. 

Such a “world burning behind his feet” sensation is a strong indicator of Ni Vulnerable (seventh slot in MBTI):

*The individual prefers to focus on immediate tasks, taking things as they come, rather than try to evaluate the outcome of present trends. Inclination to tell stories or narrate events on a sequential basis, rather than outlining how one event led to another.* ***He perceives time in an undifferentiated manner: the past, present, and future are all perceived as being in or near the present. When talking about the future, especially one's longer-term plan), the individual treats it as if it were accessible today and often is not aware of all the developments that must happen first. He generally has a poor sense of how long things will take and what the best amount of time to spend on things is.*** *Therefore it is difficult for him to stay on schedule without extensive, even total, pre-planning.*

It confirms that he has Ni Vulnerable, meaning Chase has Ne Mobilizing (third slot in MBTI) with hidden agenda to be perfect:

*The individual deeply appreciates people who are full of ideas and imagination and who give them a sense of connectedness to what is happening ""out there in the world,"" even if this information cannot be applied practically at the present moment. He is even more grateful for people who provide insightful ideas and unconventional analysis to enhance what he is working on or going through at the present moment.For example you can notice this, from Nova’s videos, from how Chase is obsessed by reading “get rich quick books”. That’s a typical example of Ne Mobilizing in business.*

What about him referring so much to others when it comes to ideas? It doesn’t necessarily imply that Chase values Te. Chase has a very bad developed Ti Suggestive (fourth slot in MBTI) as you can notice the facts exposed in Nova’s video. Chase is unsure about his own thinking capabilities, even if he doesn’t openly admit so, and that’s why he refers so much to other people’s work.  It’s not uncommon to see that behavior in Fe Leading/Base users.

Yes, Chase is an unhealthy ESE/ESFJ.. Well, a disgrace for your type... A rotten apple within the ESFJ type. 

Looking at Nova’s video, it sounds that Chase has narcissistic-like tendencies (*with his cult acts like his narcissist supply*) and that he is a scam artist. We can infer that ENTP is a mask that he uses to avoid seeking help as well as to attract people in his cult.

Enneagram wise he is a 6w5 1w9 3w2 so/sp: *“A dutiful social warrior focused on security, with a tendency of spotting people inconsistencies and criticizing them,  plus enjoying meeting and charming people.*” So/sp stacking motivates him to be a social climber. So/sp individuals may lack warmth (check) and are often awkward in 1–1 interactions *(check, you can see plenty of examples in Nova’s videos).* 

In the disintegration phase Chase acts like an unhealthy 349 *(competitive and arrogant; moody and irrational; disengaged and apathetic)*. That’s why some people think that he is a type 3w4 in the enneagram.  An example of his irrationality is claiming that the sperm stands up and becomes the nervous system, which it’s a bullshit, as Flowstate made him notice in the Youtube video **“What MBTI personality type is sperm?”**

My personal advice to you?  Avoid him at all costs, don’t buy his services and don’t give to him donations. 

Feel free to share this post as much as possible so that more people are aware of the true nature of Chase Joseph.",1599985366

ESFJ,"· Looks like an introvert, small smile while speaking, laughs a lot 

· Her love language is words of affirmation and acts of service

· One thing she likes about herself is that she’s pretty positive and bubbly, likes to keep things light-hearted and entertaining around friends. She loves making people feel loved and doesn’t dwell on things too much

· Something she’d like to change is her indecisiveness because she struggles making decisions since she’s scared of making the wrong one. She said she needs to be more assertive and go with her gut, and she’s a procrastinator.

· Although she has felt depressed/anxious at times, she said she’s blessed to have a great supportive network of friends/family

· She’s quite shy, but it depends on the time and place too because she’s happy to interact with new people. However at a place like a party, she’s really awkward and shy.

· In terms of relationships, she finds it important to see what someone prioritizes in life, how they treat their family, their goals/ambitions, their sense of humor, their loyalty, and communication skills

· She hates confrontation, but believes it’s important to express your emotions and thoughts if there’s something upsetting you.

· She used to be obsessive over her grades, but learned to not put too much stress on them once she grew older. 

· Sometimes she compares herself to others and although she admits it can be toxic, she says it also pushes her to try harder and become a better version of herself. She always compares herself to others who have their shit together and do well career wise.

· Responds to hate in a really patient, nice way. She says you can’t stop people thinking the way they want to think, so you should just be kind when you can

· Believes people should choose a career they’re passionate about and enjoy doing. She said it’s all about trial and error, and to look at the bigger picture and envision where you’d want to be in 10 years.

· Hardworking, but often is overworked, stressed, and sleep deprived

· Lifestyle is all over the place at times (ex: eating one meal a day and sleeping at 4am)

· Some things that really annoy her include people who bail on plans at last minute all the time, people who can’t do simple things on their own because they’re lazy so they depend on others, and people who have no respect for others’ time.

· Usually needs to study in a library because she can’t study well at home.

· Gets excited about new, exciting opportunities

· Studied law in college because she found her law class in high school interesting; however, she’s reconsidering careers in law because she prefers doing something in marketing",1599707768
ESFJ,Soo... My best friends is an ESFJ and I always hated about him that he lacks assertiveness about telling me things that I do wrong.... For example: he is an amazing guitar player who plays since he was 10 (he's 23 now) and everytime when I ask him about my guitar playing he always says that it's good even though I know that can be A LOT better. It's like he doesn't want to hurt my feelings even though he knows I won't be mad at him for those things. Is this an ESFJ thing or? I wanna hear your thoughts,1599603008
ESFJ,"Do you feel you are more susceptible to feeling cold (or hot) than others? Are you usually the one miserably shivering in the corner while others seem perfectly fine? Or are you the one who doesn't even seem to notice the temperature while others complain persistently?

I’m checking a theory I have about how cognitive functions influence our physical sensations. I’ll explain it in the comments so that you’re not biased by it.

This is about how cold you feel, not how long you can endure it. You can be more sensitive to the cold than others, yet still be able to outlast them in it.

ESFJ,"Hi guys, some of you will probably get angry at me, but anyway, I wasn’t able to break up with my current ESFJ gf for two times. 
The first time, she asked me to give her a chance and she made me feel so bad about myself that I cried a lot. 
The second time, I didn’t straightforwardly told her that I want to break up but said it in a subtle way hoping things will just fade out somehow but still she wrote a long emotional text message. Unfortunately, I actually read the whole thing and again felt really bad. Things she wrote made me question my actions, anyway, I decided to keep it again. Also, she asked me to meet one last time. She asked for that the first time too.
Now this time, it’s been a long time since the second time, we were doing more or less okay but I just feel that our personalities don’t match. We just like making out/kissing, touching each other. Like physically we enjoy each other, but spiritually I feel like we are so different. Spiritually, I feel empty, like I’m wasting my time. Also, she is being sexual all the time, emotional all the time and acting like it’s just only with me, only because of me, like any other guy wouldn’t make her feel this way, which doesn’t sound real to me, sounds like an exaggeration.

So, anyway, guys, this time, if I decide to break up with her, what words do I use? How to do I text her? Can you put some sample basis for the message? Like each time I text her, she comes back with 100 questions, 100 sentences that make me feel bad and question my decision. Should I say it’s because of me? Or should I actually explain why? But I feel like she just doesn’t understand, I told her several times that I think that our personalities just don’t match and she keeps telling me how much she is willing to change because she loves me so much (I don’t feel comfortable with the word “love”)",1599588510

ESFJ,"I can't tell if my friend is ISFJ or ESFJ because I'm confident she uses Fe and Si, but I can't tell.

\- She’s very easily influenced by the people she hangs around, getting into piercings and tattoos because her friends have them, liking raves because her friends attend them, etc.

\- Suspicious by nature, but gullible if she’s friends with them. She’ll be cautious and skeptical of people’s intentions and character; however if she knows them personally and they’re nice to her, she’ll be trusting of them and see everything they do in a good light.

\- Very insecure, constantly compares herself (especially her looks) to others, wants plastic surgery, nitpicks her appearance, and has body dysmorphia. However I feel like she needs validation, so she posts on social media a lot for compliments.

\- Ever since she was a preteen, she’d get anxious thinking about her future and the future in general.

\- Has anxiety, including social anxiety. She’s scared of many things such as her grades, quitting jobs, her own driving, transferring schools, changing her hair even though she wants to, paranormal things, the dark, and even eating jelly which is why she’s only had pb&amp;j once. She also gets paranoid over potential health issues, often self-diagnosing diseases.

\- She’s really scared of rejection and always wonders if she’s doing something wrong or annoying people. Another one of her biggest fears is disappointing her loved ones.

\- She feels bad over every little thing, and she said one of her biggest flaws is wanting to explain herself and let her intentions be known, but being too scared to do it.

\- Often hopes for the best but is scared she’ll get her hopes up, yet she assumes the worst then gets torn between the two.

\- Extremely nice, kind girl but is easily taken advantage of. People often tell her she’s too nice, doesn’t see her worth, and she has mentioned being nice doesn’t get her anywhere. She said she’s over being too nice when she shouldn’t have been in certain situations. However, she’s still too nice.

\- Although she’s really nice, people are often intimidated by her when they haven’t met her yet because she has a strong resting bitch face.

\- She’s really shy, quiet, and awkward around strangers. She doesn’t speak much around people she doesn’t really know and stutters a lot around them. However she used to always talk about how she wants more friends. Nowadays she isn’t as shy, but still isn’t outgoing.

\- Often speaks her opinions on twitter, saying things like how people need to learn manners or how she can’t stand people who count favors. 

\- She can be stubborn over some opinions, saying those opinions are right. For example, she believes everyone should have their children get vaccination shots. However she said people can’t see everything one-sided all the time.

\- Stresses how important it is to communicate issues, and can’t stand when people do things like switch up on her because of something they didn’t like without addressing the problem with her.

\- Quite sensitive and cries easily. She once talked about complicated customers interrogating her about the restaurant’s menu and while telling the story, her voice was getting shaky and her eyes were tearing up. She also wants to cry whenever someone raises their voice at her.

\- She said she always gets let down every time she’s happy, and she thinks that will never change. 

\- She’s a pretty open person; she might be vague about some things if she doesn’t know you well, but generally she’s quite open about her personal life and is willing to answer questions people ask her.

\- She said things change sometimes and it’s crazy how much can change in just a year. At the same time, she says she needs some change in her life. 

\- She once wanted to apologize to anyone she has ever done wrong and thank those who did her wrong because she grew from each experience and plans on continuing to. 

\- Values friends a lot, sees them as family, and wants to keep them forever. 

\- Loves her family, has a close relationship with them, sees her siblings as best friends, and hates seeing her younger siblings grow up because she wants to keep them young.

\- Can be impatient, sees herself as the most impatient person ever, and can have an attitude at times when she’s stressed or angry about something (ex: accidentally sassing friends/bf).

\- Hates when people are quick to judge. She won’t judge someone by their past or reputation until they show that they haven’t changed a bit.

\- Doesn’t enjoy continuously thinking about the past, but says that it just happens. However she also hates when people won’t leave the past in the past, and won’t accept that she isn’t who she used to be back then.

\- Her school notes are extremely organized, color-coordinated, and decorated. She procrastinates a lot, but also studies very hard once she starts to the point of studying while cooking. 

\- She cares about making and saving money, but she also has bad spending habits. However she has more savings than other friends and people our age. 

\- She associates a lot of songs with memories and those songs make her feel a certain way. She also feels happy, sad, etc. whenever she sees Snapchat memories. 

\- Her friend (who she wasn’t close to) recently passed away a few weeks ago. She still thinks of him every day and all the memories they had together, and still gets sad on the daily. 

\- She has a hard time staying single and always wants to be in relationship. She likes hanging out with a lot of friends and enjoys going out with them, but said she’s an introvert. However she had a hard time staying indoors during quarantine even though she still did.

\- She wants something consistent in life.

\- She laughs at everything, including things that many other people don’t think are funny.

\- She recently joined a sorority even though she never actually planned to join one because she wanted a fresh start in a new college with a new beginning. She said the sorority is different from what she imagined it to be, and has pushed her to become the person she always wanted to be.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TZhwFZ7-lY&amp;list=PLbauC13FulZCbgxKPLpQIHKJLRR0rNaVk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TZhwFZ7-lY&amp;list=PLbauC13FulZCbgxKPLpQIHKJLRR0rNaVk)

heres a link to their channel! they have such lovely personalities and a beautiful friendship. i am a big fan of these women, as their information is so well conveyed and easily accessible. 

if any of you get social anxiety like i do (still too scared to join a discord server lol but im gearing up to it), they're incredibly pleasant to speak to. i messaged them right here on reddit! i was also nervous that i could be incorrect about my typing, but they confirmed it for me. 

so if youre interested in being part of research or just talking to some really nice people, i recommend contacting them for an interview!",1599489291

ESFJ,"\- Always speaks her mind when she has a problem with something. For example, a girl in our table kept accidentally interrupting her. She sassily confronted her saying, “Girl are you gonna let me talk or nah? You keep interrupting me every few seconds.” The same girl was also eating a lot of the gummy bears my friend brought to class. My friend then said, “Hide the gummy bears because if you don’t, she’ll eat them all by the time we get back” in front of the girl’s face.

\- Loves to brag about everything from her grades to her baking skills to how much she gyms. She tends to talk about how she’s a really nice, kind person. For example, she once took a survey for a stranger because she said she knows how it feels to not have people take a survey. 

\- She can be quite arrogant about her abilities, often bragging about how smart she is whenever she gets a good grade on an exam. Sometimes this arrogance leads to putting others down, like she once repeatedly told everyone around her, “You can’t do math” when she was solving math problems. However whenever she does poorly, she constantly talks about how she’s so stupid and how she’s sad. I assume it’s to get reassurance, but I’m not sure.

\- Always thinks she’s right. We’ve done group work problems together and I showed her an answer was wrong with evidence from online sources. However she refused to believe them and still stuck to her own answer, claiming that those online sources are incorrect.

\- Aggressive personality and goes after what she wants. She typically doesn’t take my food when I offer her some. However I brought in expensive chocolate for our class table to share, and she ended up putting them under her desk then asked if she could have them all even though the others in our table only had one piece. After doing this, she justified herself saying her family never takes free things though.

\- We had a class in the late afternoon and she left an hour early every class session to go to the gym since she refused to get home any later than her usual time. The professor passive-aggressively called her out on leaving class, but she disobeyed him and continued doing it, saying he can’t control her.

\- She openly admitted to being rude, but says it’s a good thing because people of her culture are extremely blunt. 

\- Often struggles making up her mind about a decision because she keeps second guessing. Always asks detailed questions for a long time and says things like, “Are you gonna be able to help me out? I can’t fail.”

\- Can get controlling in group work if no one’s doing anything, especially since she hates free riders. Once in a class, she yelled at a group member and demanded him to do work since he wasn’t doing anything. She said she can yell at them because she’s close to them (in her perspective).

\- She’s extremely playful, enjoys teasing/roasting people at their expense, engages in a lot of banter, is always laughing. However she can take her jokes too far and is unaware when people get annoyed at her jokes. 

\- She’s pretty impatient and cares a lot about time. The first thing she prioritizes with choosing class schedules is the time. She also rushes to get home. However with classes, she also tries to avoid professors who are mean.

\- Considers herself close to someone she meets only after a short period of time. She’ll only have spoken to someone in class for a few weeks then say she’s close to them. 

\- She speaks to strangers as if she’s already friends with them. The first thing she ever said to me when we didn’t know each other yet was that she isn’t forgiving me for not choosing the college she wanted to go to, but couldn’t get into. She once also spoke to a stranger, asking them about her favorite boy band and fangirling about them.

\- She does whatever she pleases to the point of even sneaking behind a professor’s desk to take pictures of his textbook without permission.

\- Doesn’t like acting cheesy or expressing things like missing her friends when they leave. However she’s quite open with her emotions, often saying that she cried herself to sleep or how she’s so anxious or stressed over this or that. 

\- She boldly cheats on exams, taking out notes when the professor’s close in proximity. She has also gotten caught cheating before, but lied to the teacher and got away with it then proceeded to brag.

\- Friendly, outgoing, very chatty, helpful, can be pretty loud, and can be generous at times. She has helped me out with homework assignments and given me free answers. She also sometimes brings food to share or gives me snacks for free (even though she gets them free).

\- Has skipped classes to drive 8 hours to another city in order to go to her favorite group’s concert. 

\- Cheap unless it comes to her favorite boy band, which she’ll spend hundreds for. She downloads free textbooks instead of purchasing them.

\- She said many people find her intimidating when they meet her, probably because she has a strong personality and already acts like she’s close to whichever stranger she’s speaking to.

\- Not sure if this is manipulation, but she wanted me to help her out with her internship and said she’s asking because she wants me to learn the useful information for my own good. She also kept trying to persuade me into doing the task, mentioning how all of her friends are doing it and listing reasons why it’s beneficial for me. Basically she reminded me of those marketing people who persuade sales.

\- She was desperately looking for a job over the summer last year because she said she can’t stay home all day.

\- Has given me unsolicited advice about paying my own bills to not leech off of my parents, etc.

\- Her school note are really organized and color coordinated, but her clothes at home are in a huge pile.

\- Enjoys keeping up with celebrities, running a celebrity fan page, baking and cooking, going to the gym, and watching anime.

ESFJ,"Background: 

I am quite certain (not absolutely sure) that my mom is an ESFJ, she sympathizes and emphasizes easily but she SOMETIMES (not always) take things to heart too easily as well. She is usually a cheerful person, she likes to have a light shitpost convo with me, she likes to joke around and tease, too, she usually looks at things in a brighter light and all that. Whenever there are minor inconveniences, she usually kinda micro blowup but revert back to her usual cheerful self, she can't really handle emotions well and it kinda spills out here and there once in a while. Now, for the slightly bigger to large inconveniences, she usually takes it far deep into her heart and sulk, be bitter, be passive-aggressive, and all that unhappy stuff that will last for at least 2-3 days, which causes us to walk on our toes because her emotions spread to the whole family member, not just the original person that made her mad. If we don't comply, her temper tantrum might be prolonged. 

&amp;#x200B;

Current problem:

She is now having her 2-3 days fit. It started this morning when my parents were heading inside after buying us breakfast outside. By the gate, my mom made a comment on how pretty our neighbor's flowers are. My dad (INTJ) said ""yeah, too bad our flowers aren't like that, we don't really have anything to show."" or along those lines. His sentence is not wrong, our house along with the little garden that we have are surrounded by a 2-2.5 meter tall WALLS, not fence but WALLS, like, solid cement walls. Our little garden on the first floor isn't as pretty as it used to be, it has a few flowers, but is still well kept. Lately, my mom has been tending and focusing more on her cacti garden on the top floor to make resell (she has a plan to be a cacti gardener), which my dad fully support and fund, so the cacti up there are accumulating in various sizes, colors, and types. Apparently, my mom took his comment as offensive because she thinks my dad was calling her garden ugly, or along those thoughts. 

Her bad emotions have spread to the other family members. My dad tried to talk to her, but she ignored him. I tried to talk to her, too, but she said ""ask your dad, he knows what the problem is."". My little brother (mommy's boy) brought her her breakfast because after my mom began to sulk, she refuses to eat, his offering is refused, too. 

I am lost here, I don't know how to fix this. help me, please. if my mom sounds like another MBTI personality, please tell me, so I can post there, too. I really don't like it when the people I hold dear are sad.",1599381596

ESFJ,"I have a best friend who seems Fe dominant, but there are also a few weird things about her that make me question her type.

* She's very easily influenced by the people around her and cares about things such as popularity and fitting in. She's in a social sorority.
* She's friendly, open about her personal life and most of her emotions, talkative, uses a lot of facial expressions and hand gestures, helpful, and nice
* She sometimes talks about how she's too nice to people and that she cares too much about others. She can get pretty angry or upset if she doesn't see reciprocated effort in a relationship or get any appreciation for the things she does for people
* Enjoys complimenting others even if she doesn't genuinely mean the compliments
* Prefers if everyone likes her or has a good impression of her, including those that she secretly dislikes. She can be sort of two-faced
* Hardworking, anxious, asks many questions for clarification, bad under pressure, dislikes big changes or unexpected things, organized with really good notes in school, and a big planner
* She has admitted she needs male validation to feel better about herself and she enjoys attention. She has a hard time staying single and always wants to be in a relationship
* Enjoys cooking and baking for other people, as well as doing other services for them
* Follows all the latest beauty trends, listens to mainstream music, gets into whatever everyone else is into such as Tik Tok, and typically follows group opinions
* She can be nosy, likes to gossip, and meddles into people's business offering advice and trying to help them out
* Thinks having ""face"" is extremely important

However, I find these things unusual for an Fe dominant user

* She called herself aggressive to the point of knowingly bothering others and not caring as long as she still gets things her way
* Has been in physical fights, even once with a stranger because they pushed her mom and she got extremely pissed because she doesn't allow anyone to mess with her family
* Enjoys debating ideas with other people such as when discussing things in groupwork
* Loves power, wants to be in charge of every guy she dates, and wants to run her own business in the future
* Has confronted a little kid over cutting her in line because the kid can't take advantage of her
* Really loves money and doesn't believe that gold digging is that bad of a thing
* Impatient to the point of always interrupting others without being aware of it. Her body language when walking also looks rushed and sort of aggressive

ESFJ,"Hi guys, I’m an ESFJ (26F) currently engaged to an INTP (26M). I wanna share my experiences on dating different types with you guys.

In the past, I had dated:

- ISFJ: we got along very well at first but the chemistry wore off quickly because he preferred staying in his comfort zone more than facing relationship obstacles as we grew older. We let it go peacefully and stayed friends. 

- ESFP: it’s hard to have deep conversations with him. I always yearn for a partner who can make me see beyond my realm of sensing and he clearly couldn’t deliver. Fun to be around sometimes but the relationship didn’t have much depth to it.

- ISTP: we clashed so much because we failed to see each other’s values. I was dating him because he chased after me so persistently so I just wanted to give him a chance. But it was tiring from the beginning til the end.

- ENTP: he loved me a lot because he wanted a loving, caring, soft-spoken partner. However, I found him bossy, immoral at times based on his work ethics, he also trashed everyone around us and it made me very uncomfortable. He is always ready to throw himself into troubles to enjoy the fun out of it. This drove me nuts! No plans of settling down so it’s another drawback... also he’s a big talker not a doer, which turned me off severely.

- INTP (my fiancé): at first we clashed so much and we couldn’t understand the other person’s POV at all. Yet, we still found each other extremely attractive (opposites do attract!!!). So we dated and started discussing about our types. We overcame a huge milestone of acknowledging our strengths and weaknesses in front of each other. It was rocky but we knew the other person would make us grow. We were constantly getting out of our comfort zones to make it work (we both like getting out of comfort zones). Somehow we realized we shared similar core values and ideas, after all we are each other’s subconscious. We both practice compromising for each other. He became more sensitive and attentive to my needs. And I learnt to be straightforward with my opinions and the logical aspects of things. 

I respect all types and all relationships. I just wanna share my own experiences with you guys :)

I know I’m definitely a feeler too, that made sense in my results. I mean, I was totally an ENFP when I graduated HS. When I took the test back in 2003, all the numbers were fairly high. My Extrovert score was something like 70-80%, the iNtuitive was something like 65-70%, Feeling was 80-85% and my Judging was something like 70%. Does getting married to a Sailor really change you that much? 😆 I took the test about 2 weeks ago, I’ve been with my husband 7 years now. Now my scores are Extrovert 67%, Sensing 60%, Feeling 76% and Judging 53%. I remember seeing something above how we’re good military spouses, we’re good at packing up and moving every 3 years? We met in San Diego, he was there a year before getting stationed in Japan, we were there 3 years and we’re in CT now... we’re supposed to move to WA once my husband has some medical issues taken care of.

ESFJ,"Some of my friends and I have trouble deciding if our friend is ESFJ or ESTJ.

\- People are often intimidated by her upon first meeting because she has a super strong personality. She likes to roast people and banter with them even if she's only known them for a day. She also appears extremely outgoing from the get-go, speaking to strangers as if she's already known them for a long time. I was intimidated by her because when we met from a group project, she was a bit rude, controlling, temperamental, and confrontational while leading us. However, I got to know her better after that and she redeemed herself because she has a very playful personality and doesn't have bad intentions when she acts mean. 

\- Her self-esteem fluctuates from very confident to sometimes being insecure, but she typically has high self-confidence. She likes bragging about her accomplishments, but when there are setbacks, she speaks about herself negatively (ex: calling herself dumb). She also speaks negatively as a way to get pity and possibly reassurance since she repeatedly insults herself.

\- When it comes to school, she needs a lot of guidance. She always asks for my advice on which classes to register for and overthinks every choice. She fears taking classes alone because she thinks she might fail without friends. She takes super long to finalize a decision since she's always hesitating between choices and asking thousands of questions.

\- She's good at understanding where others are coming from. One time, a stranger asked us to take a survery and I declined sicne I was lazy, but she helped and said it's because she knows how it feels from personal experience when people rejected her while she had a similar task.

\- She can be pretty helpful and usually isn't the type of person to be greedy. I've offered her food and other things, but she typically doesn't take anything unless I insist. She gives me free food from her home sometimes and has let me copy her work. One of her biggest pet peeves is free-riders who take everything yet never give back. Although she's pretty nice, she can also exaggerate how good of a person she is. A lot of times she likes to tell stories about how kind-hearted she is.

\- We've ditched class in the middle of a lab and our professor passive-aggressively called us out for it. She continued ditching and ignored what he said because she claimed he can't control us. 

\- Her hobbies include keeping up with male celebrities, running a fanpage of them, going to the gym, baking, and cooking. She skipped class to drive to a city 8 hours away for a concert.

\- She's uncomfortable with cheesy things like giving goodbye speeches, but she's not really uncomfortable about speaking about her emotions. She's told me about crying herself to sleep, being stressed / anxious, and how she's emotional on her period.

\- She has called herself a rude person but she doesn't see this as a bad thing since her family is like that. She's also somewhat aggressive with getting what she wants. One time I brought a variety of food for a few friends to share, but she snatched the whole thing asking if she could take it all even though the others barely had any.

\- She exaggerates how hardworking she is, claiming that she doesn't know why she failed an exam when she studied nonstop for a week. At the same time, once she does well on an exam, she then claims she barely tried.

\- She's quite concerned with saving time and is a fast-paced person. We both hate waiting for buses and often sprint to make the soonest one coming even if it'll be crowded. 

\- She feels close to people very quickly. As long as she speaks to someone a few times, she'll claim they're a friend and if she knows them on a level that's closer than a classmate, she'll say she's close to them.",1597183370

ESFJ,"My mom is an ESFJ, she and my dad are the reasons why 'words of affirmation' will never work for me.

I see my mom as a people pleaser to the point where she'll lie to you just to stay on your good side I guess? Even tho, she really didn't want to do the thing or maybe she forgot every single time?

ESFJ,"Hi guys, so before I start, sorry for multiple posts, and also sorry, I really feel terrible for having to do this but dating someone that I cannot rely on would make my life miserable.
So, just a quick summary: it’s been almost 2 months since we met, we had 5 dates in total (1 of them was really short, so let’s assume 4 dates) and have been constantly texting each other. So, before the last (5th) date, I was having some doubts about her but today, on the 5th date, I cleared all my doubts and made up my mind that we are not compatible as she doesn’t seem to be a decent girl in my understanding. I will explain why, so as an INTJ I’m a slightly reserved person and like to take it slow when it comes to physical intimacy, but this girl broke all the boundaries today and also, all the expectations that I had about her. First of all, she was dressed inappropriately, I understand she wanted to look hot but there should be some limits. Secondly, we’ve been giving each other kisses on a cheek, but then all of a sudden she started making out with me (not gonna lie I didn’t resist, obviously it’s an enjoyable sensation), she was trying to touch me and stuff, like she was really getting into it. At some point I thought to myself “wait, we barely had 4 dates only hugging each other, how did we go so fast”. Now, let’s put all this aside. The other thing that I have been complaining about to her is that we don’t talk about smth except lovey-dovey talk. And this time, I tried again to talk about smth, to hold an intellectual conversation but all she would do was she would stare at me and bite her lip saying “you look so sweet”, like I get it, it’s affection and stuff but not being able to talk to her about smth interesting is so frustrating for me.
So anyway, guys, please don’t judge, I really wouldn’t want things to be this way and wish she would fit the picture I had about her in my mind but unfortunately, it didn’t work. So now my question is how do I break up with her in the least painful way for her? Which way I should go? 
I have few options in my mind: 
1) Once we had a discussion on how girl should not dress, and when I told her about the things I wouldn’t want her to wear, she didn’t accept that and she was almost ready to quit with me but then I kinda stepped back. So as an option, I could bring this topic up again and she would break up with me by herself, I guess:)
2) The other option is to gradually text her less and to respond very late, and if she gets mad I will just tell her as it is, that I don’t feel we match.
3) To tell her right now, straightforward—this seems to me as the most painful way to be honest.

Sorry my silliness but I really don’t want to cause any pain, I’ve been trying to be very cautious from the beginning but she’s been always pushing me. Also, keep in mind that we work in the same corporate building but on the different floors: at the moment, we work from home but very soon we might go back the office.",1597001115
ESFJ,"Hey everyone.

My name is Oliver Powell. I'm a psychologist and my personality type is is ESTP 8w7 sx/sp.

I wanted to give all of you a warning, as I ran a check on the YouTuber CS Joseph and I found out that he's full of bullshits. He is a con artist and he is horrible at typology.

1. MBTI is about cognitive preferences. It doesn't automatically equal skills. Chase doesn't keep that in mind, so he ends up using a lot of bullshit stereotypes. No wonder that he mistypes a lot of people.
2. Any combo of enneagram and MBTI is possible. Enneagram covers basic motivations... But he disregards the enneagram, fusing automatically basic motivations within cognitive functions, ending up easily mistyping people. For instance he insists in claiming that Frank James is an INFP, when Frank James is an INFJ with enneagram 4w5.
3. Some of the concepts that he talks about are in a nutshell a bastardized version of socionics model A, but repackaged with different terminology. For instance his ""four sides of the mind"" are called in socionics model A as ego block, id block (unconscious ego), super id block (subconscious ego) and superego block.
4. He isn’t an ENTP as he claims. Chase is an unhealthy ESTJ (ego Te Si Ne Fi) 6w5 SO 613 often stuck in Te-Ne loops and on top of that he has most likely ASPD.

First of all Chase is a Te Dom:

4D valued Leading/Dominant Te: ""*Extroverted logic as base function is manifested as a need to accumulate factual information, also from external sources such as books, second-hand information, etc, on matters of personal interest or of professional activity. This also gives these types confidence on being well-informed on the same matters, which enables them to enter arguments related to them with confidence on their knowledge, which may come across as arrogance to others. Another manifestation is an evaluation of external reality - work activities, world events, finances, procedures, personal relationships, conversations - from the point of view of factual accuracy and ""making sense"" and efficiency. It leads to an inclination to be proactive in increasing the efficiency and reasonableness of the external world, as well as a sense of self-worth connected on being involved and productive in activities seen as useful, profitable, or that increase one's knowledge base. To give out information that the individual knows not to be factually accurate is disturbing and avoided as much as possible.""*

His second slot Si is poorly developed and he often turns it off, enganging often in Te-Ne loops:

*""ESTJs can also develop a warped or imbalanced use of their auxiliary function, Introverted Sensing (Si). When this happens,* ***they become obsessed with sticking to what they know, rapidly closing off alternate viewpoints and perspectives. They may become deeply upset by change  or they may become focused on seeing impracticalities in others. They may become so tied to their own personal, subjective experience that they discount other people’s experiences or are unwilling to see other perspectives.*** *Healthy Si is very aware of details, facts, sense-impressions, and important memories. It is practical, responsible, and highly attuned to changing patterns. Unhealthy Si feels that everything needs to fall in adherence with one’s own subjective experience of how things have always been.""*

\^ Hence the over-generalization that Chase makes all over in his videos.

Look at this description and you'll realize that his Ne is actually third slot, not first slot as he claims:

2D valued Mobilizing/Child: ""***The individual deeply appreciates people who are full of ideas and imagination and who give them a sense of connectedness to what is happening ""out there in the world,"" even if this information cannot be applied practically at the present momen****t. He is even more grateful for people who provide insightful ideas and unconventional analysis to enhance what he is working on or going through at the present moment.""*

You can see Chase often complimenting and appreciating people who are full of ideas, for example nominating in several occasion his mentor and talking about him.

Chase is often looping between Te and Ne:

*""When an ESTJ is in a Te-Ne loop, they are unable to effectively access their introverted functions, Si and Fi. During these times, they become obsessed with possibilities, but often in a negative light. They may see a million ways things could go wrong and try to “jump in” and fix them as quickly as possible without looking at the facts or taking the time to carefully observe the situation internally. They may have a difficult time prioritizing or reaching their goals and they may take hasty action on strange, intuitive whims without really understanding where their premonitions are coming from. This can be a very stressful stage for them as they feel more and more frustrated by their inability to organize, plan, and decide as effectively as they usually do. It’s important for ESTJs who realize they’re in a Te-Ne loop to get healthy access to Si. Take some time to enjoy some peace and quiet and reflect on an experience you enjoy. Find a favorite activity that you’ve always enjoyed, whether it’s a crossword puzzle or cooking a certain meal, and repeat that process. Give yourself time to “introvert” and do some no-pressure detail-oriented project. Getting Si back into the picture will help you regain composure and get out of a loop.""*

As further proof of him being an ESTJ:

*- He finds Ni irritating (Ni being Vulnerable/Trickster for ESTJs), despising INFJs (the conflictuals of ESTJs) and having problems with INTJs (different methods to get effective results done).*

*- He praises a lot Ti, which in ESTJ is their Observing function, and in particular ISTPs. And the default communication style of ISTP is the best way to communicate with ESTJs.*

*- Love/hate relationship with high Fi users, but in particular xNFP types. It points to Fi Suggestive/Inferior.*

*- He is a more chaotic than usual for ESTJs due to being in Te-Ne loops.*

Some people think that Chase's main enneagram is 3w4, but what they're sensing is the disintegration phase of Chase.

Chase is an unhealthy 6w5.

*""Unhealthy 6w5 become increasingly paranoid and obsessed with maintaining their security, and may go to great lengths to protect their positions. They are extremely needy, and may abuse alcohol or drugs as a way of dealing with anxiety and paranoid delusions, as well as of bolstering their inferioirty feelings. The Five-wing adds elements of cynicism and nihilism to the fearful mentality of the unhealthy Six, resulting in growing isolation, desperation, and a capacity for sociopathic actions. Intense stress will likely lead to outbreaks of rage and extremely destructive behavior accompanied by breaks with reality. Self-sabotaging, self-destructive actions bring about humiliation and punishment to atone for guilt, although the extent and nature of their self-destructiveness will be hidden from others because of their reclusive nature. There may be strong propensity for violence as well as sadomasochistic tendencies in sexual expression. Murder and suicide are both real possibilities.""*

Primary instinct SO (social). Tritype 613, considering that one of his ex mentioned how much Chase tends to avoid conflicts (*main instinct core 1*) and his self esteem is based on achievements (*3 as main heart core*).

Unhealthy 613s disintegrate towards 349... 6 disintegrates to 3: competive and arrogant; 1 disintegrates to 4: moody and irrational \[*like claiming that the sperm becomes the brain, spine and nervous system... Look at the video analysis""What MBTI personality is sperm"" by FlowState lol*\]; 3 disintegrates to 9: disengaged and apathetic.

So the question is... Why he lies about his type?

The whole ENTP charade is how he justifies his unhealthy behaviours and avoids therapy.

Amongst his unhealthy behaviours, I’ll mention that…

* Chase committed identity theft.
* One of his exes went to a therapist after frequenting him due to how much emotional damage he caused to her during their relationship.
* As mentioned by his ex Ande Sloeijk, Chase displayed behaviours that they’re congruent with someone with NPD (*amorous subtype*) or similar in their courtship.
* He persuaded a couple to avoid seeking help for their autistic son. Flowstate made a video analysis on the topic on Youtube. (**CS Joseph's Dangerous Advice | ""Ignore Your Son's Doctors"" | Criticism)**
* Pathological lying.
* A lot of passive-aggressiveness.
* Misleading information about his figure income to trick people into giving him more money. Flowstate made an approximate audit about Chase’s business (“**Cooking the Books: C.S. Joseph's Whopping 6 Figure Income Audited and Analyzed)**

It's highly likely that Chase has personality disorders. Probably ASPD in comorbity with NPD, but to say for sure a proper assessment would be needed.

Don’t donate to him. Don’t buy his services.

You have failed typology Chase Joseph.",1597000720

ESFJ,"So there’s this girl (ESFJ) that I (ISTP) was seeing. Initially she showed a lot of interest. She wanted to see me a lot, and we did. She’s really smth else. And I’ve only ever liked 1 other person before I met her, and that was an ex.

I really don’t know what happened. She just stopped texting. I could tell smth was off. And I usually don’t care if people ghost me, but this one hit different. So I texted her, we met up shortly after. But as she was on the way to me after hanging with her friends, she told me “if its too late for you i can just head home tho” looks pretty shady.

We hung out and everything was cool, we made out, we fucked. But I could tell there was a little bit of resistance. As she left the next morning she told me to “take care”. so it pretty much sounds like a goodbye lmao.

I’m kinda idk sad? Because I’ve never met someone like her before (an ESFJ basically). But I also understand people can leave if they want to, as they have before.

ESFJ,"ESFJS and Social work?

Hi guys, new to the thread so I am unsure about whether this q has been asked. I was previously working for government administration and decided I wanted to make career change into the social services field. I’ve been looking into social work but was wondering what your thoughts were on ESFJs compatibility and potential burn out? My worry is that I have a lot of anxiety and maybe too empathic that It may be too emotionally draining for me. As and ESFJ I love talking to people about their issues but I hit a wall and become too drained if that person isn’t adding anymore value to the convo or is unwilling to see my perspective or listen to me. 

On the other hand, I quit my job because it was too mundane and felt meaningless. I worked for an Indigenous Council here in Canada and thought that it would be feel fulfilling for me.. but I reached a point where I wanted more recognition I guess. There was no growth in the role and I was craving a job where I could sit one on one with someone and they could turn to me for help. Where I am the one in a “higher” position I would say? Idk if that sounds mean but hopefully you understand. My last job was easy but I surprisingly got burnt out so fast and I am unsure if it was because of the actual work .. or because I wasn’t happy and didn’t enjoy being bitched around (im learning to the latter). I always looked at my superiors and thought damn I would do so much of a better job than you (but at the same time I feel like I would be stressed and not good enough.. even though I know I am lol??) 

Anyways, let me know what you think.. or if you have any other thoughts on career options? I am slowly planning on taking some courses that will allow me to apply for my Masters in Social Work  in the near future if I choose to (hopefully with focus on eating disorders).

The mother of my 2 littles is an ESFJ and what started off as something great 9 years ago has seemed all but lost for the last 5 or so. There seems to be an emotional hurdle that she requires that I just can’t accomplish. An inability to see things through someone else’s eyes who may not be an emotional driven person like she is, and also the inability to move on from past hurt to live in the present and plan for a future. A habit to take something I say through the most negative lens, and then a lack in effort to talk through it.

ESFJ,"Hi, so I'm pretty sure I'm an ESFJ, I identify with most of the qualities, exhibit most of the common characteristics, and the dominant functions and individual factors all seem to suit me. One common thing I hear about though is EFSJ's fear of conflict and how much they avoid it. Personally though, I  actually quite like conflict, in the sense of, if I am able to create a space and mediate a discussion (or heated argument) between two people where they can deal with their issues, or I can have a conversation with a person where we both discuss our issues with each other. There's nothing I hate more then tension hanging in the air or knowing that two people aren't dealing with their issues with one another if ultimately it can make them both happier. My best friend and I (ENFP) are kind of known amongst our friends for having arguments as though it were small talk, where we debate as though it were a casual conversation. I also reputably 'stage interventions' with my friends confronting them about their problems and behaviours if I think its ultimately bad for them or the people around them's long term happiness, without fear of facing conflict either.

So my main question is, do any other ESFJ's feel or act this way? Because despite feeling certain in the identity, this is one trait I never seem to hear any ESFJ does not possess.",1596049683

ESFJ,"There's a celebrity who I think is ISFJ, but a lot of people type her as ESTJ on The Personality Database website. People comment saying she's clearly ESTJ and Te dominant, but won't ever provide an analysis.

I thought she's an ISFJ because:

**SIGNS OF FE:**

Interaction/demeanor is quite bubbly, cheerful, and warm. She seems group and people-focused such as:

\- ""Because I received the New Artist Award with them, I felt even heavier when I received this Bonsang award alone.""

\- ""I've met great friends and we share our difficulties with each other. I'm the type of person who relieves stress by having conversations with others.""

\- ""My dream is to communicate with lots of people and perform for a long time.""

\- ""I was worried I might not live up to the public's expectations.""

Even when it comes to how hardworking she is, her thinking process is people-focused. For example, she once said, ""- being able to sing along to a song in a foreign language shows how much my fans love me. It made me want to work harder."" Additionally, part of her reason for working so hard and becoming successful was to settle her family debt. She also got her mom a designer bag for Christmas, and wants to take a trip to Japan with her mother since her mom has been wanting to go.She even treats and sees all her backup dancers as her best friends. She makes sure to include them in everything she does, and even gives them their own screen time.

She really appreciates them all and doesn't even refer to them as ""backup dancers"". In one of her recent episodes for ""Play"", she mentioned loving to hear about one of her backup dancer's life and enjoys giving advice, which is a classic Fe thing.

**SIGNS OF SI:**

She often recalls the past and has attachment to it, is concerned about unpredictability and the future, is afraid of doing things that are different or new.

\- ""Whenever I recall the old days with friends who worked together for the first time, I thought about I.O.I.""

\- ""I know 'Gotta Go"" is a good song, but it's success is completely unpredictable. Because I don't know when, where, and what will happen.""

\- ""If I get signed on to appear on a variety show, I'll start worrying from the moment the decision is made.""

\- ""I once drank too much and slept in the toilet. So the manager had to take me home. Since then, I have never drunk too much.""

\- ""I was kind of scared to do stuff that's different or new because at some point, I just wanted to go with what's already being played and popular"" (This suggests some Fe too).

She also associates her birth name with her grandmother who passed away, saying she was worried she'd lose the name if she changed it. She also felt that getting called her birth name might cause her to be choked up by her emotions since that's the name she went by when she went through some tough times. This indicates she associates her name with past experiences.

She stated her ideal type is someone who expresses their emotions well. I feel like most ESTJs find it rather difficult dealing with other people displaying emotions (obviously a stereotype though). Everyone says she's hardworking, but ISFJs are known to be hardworking and detail-oriented too.",1596003538

How was the courtship? How did you meet? What’s your overall experience with this type? I‘d like to know everything, the good and the bad. :)",1595817849
ESFJ," So being INFP I posted a poll to INFP subreddit about how similar we are in terms of ""love and how we picture someone"".

\------

This was my description for the poll (don't attack me. it's something i genuinely struggle with and am trying to fix):

When a semi attractive person acts kind of nice to me one time, I romanticize it until I fall in love with the idealized version of them in my own mind and not actually who they are in real life. Then I get to know them more and after I fall ""out of love"", I cringe and I'm like - why did I ever like this person? I must have been insane. And it was because I had fallen in love with the idea of someone they could be that they actually weren't but I was just blinded by my romanticized view of them to see the reality of who they were.

It happens to me so often that for almost all of my past ""crushes"", I'm cringing and thinking to myself - how could I have ever liked this person?

\----

 I just thought I'd post the same poll for ESFJs because I'm curious how much the results could differ/be similar. I'm also going to post this poll to the other subreddits for the other types. Genuinely curious! Thanks!

ESFJ,,1594929230
ESFJ,"I''m an INTJ who has really struggled with dating an ESFJ. I'd categorize the main issues into two main headings.

The first being , they failed to listen. I would express how I wasn't happy with them doing something and they would pretend to listen and take on what i'd say and essentially not do those behaviours anymore but then it would occur again. and again. and again. Is this something that is common? It seems it also happened with previous partners and in the workplace with them, the need to be correct and so won't listen to anything that you find insufferable.

The second point being control. She would try to control so many things and then when I called her out on it, she would say she was helping or offering advice.........which i never asked for. Examples include what I eat (despite eating healthy), I may have the odd fast food item once every 2 months and she would forbid me because she cared. or what i spent my money on, no designer items as they are a waste of money, despite it being my own money. I did communicate how these things should be my choices in life and how she would need to stop doing this, but see point one.........something new would come up and it would be something else to control or advise on.

Do any of you recognize these traits in yourselves or ways in which these things could be solved? I know she likes to be helpful and offer advice, so i even gave her a few select topics she could offer me advice on like gardening, travel destinations and even book recommendations. This was my way of compromising but even that wasn't good enough, the control had to transcend.",1594890723

ESFJ,"Question coming from an ISFP guy here. 

I’m wondering why, when it comes to romantic attraction there’s almost always a mutual attraction between me and ESFJ’s. I’m actually really introverted, and I don’t attract that many people to be honest, but when I do it’s somehow usually a very attractive ESFJ. Always has me wondering how in the hell I end up attracting such an awesome person.

I never understand how this is possible, it’s like just when we talk there’s an instant connection and I can feel a mutual spark. I guess that maybe you guys bring out my introverted self more than any other types? Don’t know but you guys seem to make me comfortable for some reason.

No idea if this sounds stupid, but it’s true. It’s like we’re on the same wavelength a lot of the times. And that you guys understand me even when I don’t talk that much. It’s not the first time this has happened to me. What do you guys like about ISFP’s, or attracts you to them?

I personally am actually quite the stereotypical ISFP person, huge photography nerd, into music and doing what I love. I've noticed that it's usually through these Se things you guys seem to get intrigued by me in some way?

ESFJ,"Hey !

I was kinda surprised because ESFJs that I know IRL tend to be quite system oriented and try to organize effectively their strategy/plan prior to doing it so I was wondering how lack of Ti actually manifests.

After observing some of my friends/relatives of this type, here's what I found :

\- They tend to use Ne with Fe rather than Ti. This means they develop ideas, often well thoughts since backed by solid Si . Then, when it comes to picking the ""true idea""/""truth"", they pick the one that the people around them would like most.

This is why they tend to care a lot about their ideas and will often not question them. 

I ve also noticed that ESFJs tend to be happier that way. As those ideas are only questionned from the perspective of other's feelings, they tend to believe them wholeheartedly and like doing so.

\- Less accuracy when it comes to describing concepts. 

Since they only care about how those ideas are perceived by others, they do not really want to describe them accurately as this would naturally result in the idea being more in conflict with someone's feeling. I'd say that not only it is something they refrain from doing, they dont like when others do it as it is often perceived as a way to instill conflict.

ESFJ,"I’ve had a hard time learning new things. Concepts often seem to go over my head and I rarely ever recall what I thought I learnt. Over time, I realized that it was because I never truly understood what I was learning.

The Feynman technique is particularly effective at helping you master difficult concepts. Named after the Nobel Prize winning Richard Feynman, the concept focuses on explaining a difficult concept in easy to understand language as if you were explaining it to someone else (or a child). By following the Feynman technique, you might just end up learning difficult concepts quickly, spend less time studying, and remember concepts longer.

The four steps are as follows:

1. Write the concept down
2. Explain it using simple language
3. Address (look up) problematic areas or questions that remain
4. Challenge yourself to simplify it further

I have found this to be a powerful concept that helps you cut study time shortly. The push to understand and explain a concept forces you to identify areas where you have a gap in your understanding. I’ve broken this down even further here - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RleSyp16lLE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RleSyp16lLE).

Rangiku from Bleach, I'll admit I got stuck between ESFJ and ESFP with her. But I settled on ESFJ since it made more sense in the end

Rose from Fullmetal Alchemist

Alex Louis Armstrong from Fullmetal Alchemist

Rock Lee from Naruto

I type Tohru from Fruits Basket ENFJ, I type Winry Rockbell ENFJ as well from FMA Brotherhood, I type Sanji from One Piece ENFJ, you can read my Sanji ENFJ post and arguement down below if you wish.

Usopp is ENTP by the way too, I've seen people confused on his type before, Usopp is definitely a Ne dom and Ti user. I also type Misty ENFJ from the Pokemon anime.

ESFJ,"Hi!

Personabilities has created a new personality test called Intellabilities. It measures not the level but the range of your intelligence. It's kind of like a cross between MBTI and StrengthsFinder. The test takes 10-15 minutes to take and afterwards you'll get a 40 page report on your intelligence abilities and personality. It will show you what specific abilities you have, what fields of study you should pursue (as in specific college majors), and what careers would be best for you.

I'm mid 30s, male, and typically extremely social unless under circumstances which we currently find ourselves in (covid obviously).

I thought I was ESFP, but my ""kindness"" and other focus makes me think I could possibly be Fe rather than Se? I'm conflicted because I delight in sensory activities (walking in nature, indulging in food/music, the latter is especially an addiction. also audiobooks).

One thing that is making me consider P vs J is that I'm a bit of a worry wart when it comes to people. I'll intensely worry about my close circle of friends, but am comparatively apathetic to the world at large. 

Another point for the Fe function is that I'm an imitator. I can pick up on people's speech/body language patterns and mimic them for humorous effect (if it seems like they'd appreciate it). Though for some reason this strikes me as more P than Fe now that I'm thinking about it.

I'm not really sure what else to say about myself. Much of my life's focus has been on other people, so my identity seems to be on shaky grounds.

ESFJ,"Ill try and make this as short as possible without leaving out too much. Myself an INFJ(F) was dating an ESFJ(M) we were talking daily and gaming together constantly from August 2019 until he asked me to be his girlfriend on October 2019. We spent every moment of our free time together gaming and talking. March 3rd I broke up with him because I was going through some things of a “psychological” nature which I will elaborate on if asked. Also I have never had a relationship so normal and GOOD! I freaked out and broke up with him. I know I was in the wrong. Anyway, I almost instantly regretted it, I would go as far as saying I somewhat didn’t even want to do it… I just needed some kinda space that he would not give me. So 3 weeks later of no contact I ask him if we could talk. We spoke, and he said he was still very hurt and angry with me (understandable) and needed time, and that he didn’t even know if he wanted me back or not. We spoke a few times after that about it. Then he stopped replying for 3 weeks and finally ended up talking to me in which I told him I had something big planned to try and prove myself to him and that all I needed was for him to answer his phone on April 25th at approximately 1pm. So what I did was drive my ass 11 hours to see him to have a face to face talk. We spoke and he basically was still confused. I ended up staying the night and we did have a pretty decent time for 2 people still hurting and broken up. Did get physical as well on accident. I asked him if he just wanted me to stop all this.. Stop messaging and stop calling and stop sending packages and just stop “trying” and he told me that no he did not “think” he wanted that.. and that he “thinks” he just needs more time. He seemed extremely confused and said that seeing me again there probably made him even more confused. So I messaged him when I got home and that’s the last I ever heard from him. I saw on his snap story three weeks later, him apologizing to everyone for being a “ghost” but that he needed to take a break for his mental health. Its been about 2 months now that hes not reached out to me, or responded to any of my messages ( I try and keep them at a minimal). Ive said that I will accept whatever his decision but that I do need an update, a simple I need more time, or Im done with you or lets try again… just something, instead of leaving me hanging here. Hes also been wearing the ring I got him (we were planning on getting married in September so I bought him a ring with a note that said “when youre ready” yet he still wont respond to me. So I’m here, asking you ESFJ’s if you can offer any insight. Ask anything, I’m a pretty understanding person and I am humble.

ESFJ,"  


Hello everyone. This post may be long, but bear with me. As the title say, I feel very akward around one of my good friends who is an ENFP. I love him so much, as a friend, and don't want to sound cruel at all. But I don't know how to handle this at all.

There are different things he does that I don't like, or, rather, I feel weird about.He has a bad attitude for life both existentially and in behaviour. This comes in the way of depressing comments and being pessimistic about topics, jobs, school, family, etc that I find very positive and encouraging.An example: He told me that he got a summerjob for three months with good pay.I congratulated him, told him it was great news, since he has been unemployed for 6 years! I got a response (can't remember what he said, and don't want to make it up) that was downright... dumb? Sorry. He thought that it was too much work since it was 9 hours long days.I told him that I work 10 hours everyday, and only 6 of those hours are paid and I don't complain. No response.What i feel bugged about is his attitude for working. It's not meant to be fun and games, it's meant to be just that, work!

Then there are his behaviour in public.Last time when we were out browsing what is called ""booster packs"" he made a lot of loud comments about how expensive it was and he can't afford it. a lot. I picked the comments up in a way that I was supposed to buy something? Or did I misinterprent that?I felt terrible for not buying something for him.

Then there are other things, like burping loudly each time he goes by our historical church, wearing shirts with creepy themes and such.

I don't really know what to do. He goes through a tough time, but I don't want people to think I'm like him. I love him, as a friend, but at the same time, I have to think about how people view me.I'm sorry once again if I feel vain or terrible.",1593038704

And I told her everything about my personality, I tried to explain her my fears and etc. I tried to explain her that jealousy is my weakness.

Also, we discussed what type of things could make me jealous and she said that she would never do those anyway. 
My question is could she lie when agreeing with anything I said? How often do you guys lie? And would you lie in a situation like these just to get the girl/guy?

ESFJ,"He is an anxious guy and very (maybe overly) concerned about his health. 

Yesterday he had his blood drawn.

He does this thing whereby when he has visited the doctor or any medical type personnel he returns home with this very sheepish “ask me about it” body language.  So I do.

This time he came home and of course I asked him about it and he recounted how the nurses never listen to him about his small veins when he tells them about it..  which prompted me to say “OH NO did they have to jab you multiple times?!” Then he says no they got it on the first try.  (Moral of that section of the story is he has unique veins lol) then he went on to tell me about the near death experiences he had in the car on the way home because other people are terrible uncourteous drivers


***** the good part and one of the reasons I am madly in love with him.

So he sits next to me on the sofa and I notice there is a timer on his phone ticking down.  Now I KNOW why the timer is on but I just have to hear him say it. 

“Is that timer for when you can take off the little cotton ball taped to your arm?” 

Look of embarrassed busted panic

“Shut up they said twenty minutes”

I said “how long were you in the car?”

Removes little cotton ball from his arm

I am giddy with how adorable he is as he raises his arm above his head to... ¿ prevent the healed injection side from billowing out fountains of blood I assume?

“Are you raising your arm because you are worried it will bleed?”

“No it’s just comfortable like this”

Arm straight in the air like he wants to ask a teacher a question.




Lol are many ESFJ’ s worriers?    He does stuff like this all the time.  Not just with medical things but with other things. It is totally irresistibly interesting to me the way his mind works and the random things he chooses to worry about.

ESFJ," If you’ve struggled a decent amount throughout your 20s with almost every aspect of your life: career, identity, relationships, etc, you’re definitely not in the minority. 

A quarter-life crisis is far more common that you’d think. Almost 75% of 25-33 year olds go through tons of stress and anxiety about understanding who they really are. I kinda feel like I’m still working my way through it too. There is pressure to figure out what you want out of life and fear that anything you’re working towards will not work out.

As I’ve navigated this for myself, I’ve discovered that having perspective, and doing some introspection into what fulfills me has allowed me to channel my energy in the right places. I break this down so much more here - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c43MY3xxaVA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c43MY3xxaVA).

In my past relationship (with ESFP girl), I was hurt a lot by her acting flirtatious and stuff with her friends—for her, it was normal, for me it was disloyalty. Now, this ESFJ girl hasn’t done anything like that yet and it kinda feels like she’s willing to be committed, but generally, when we speak about different things and I say the things as they are, so she knows what my fears are, it feels like if I get jealous, she would make a big deal out of it (the same way as ESFP would do), like it feels like she’s not willing to find some common solution, and it feels like to her, regardless of the situation, jealousy is always wrong.

ESFJ,"Hello! I posted this on r/INTP and I'm here to gather thoughts on this from a different audience. If you are not an INTP personality type I would really like some feedback as to how you think.

Wait, hold on a sec. Do you ever just wonder how other people think? Like, sometimes it just pops up into my thoughts as too how other people think in their heads. I always have a system for thinking and the way I think about my thoughts. I usually think about a more important idea as well as kind of thinking about another idea in the back of my head. Then, if that other idea strikes some interest with me, I'll usually begin to focus on that idea more. I also realized that more in my main thoughts, I try to think about the thing I'm doing unless it's some really brainless thing like watching tv otherwise, I will always be thinking about something different in the back of my head. I thought about how in the back of my head, I ask a lot of questions and in the front of my mind, I think about and assess these questions depending on what I'm doing. For example, in the back of my mind, I might go, 'would this work for my script? (but with information on what my idea is)' then I will start focusing on that in the front of my mind seeing if it is a valid thing to try in my game. This better explains how if it interests me I will think about it. I don't always think about other questions in the back of my mind and sometimes it is just random thoughts. Also sometimes, I don't even think in that 'second layer.' A lot of times, when I wake up, I think about what I'm going to do during the day in the back of my mind, but something else that concerns me more in the front of my mind. Although, I can't decide what I'm going to do during the day until after I have showered. But also, I do spend a lot of time thinking in the shower. How many of you use the shower as a time to assess certain problems that you were thinking about. In the shower what I think about is usually determined by what I did yesterday or the people in my life. But sometimes I either just stop focusing on everything and only go through song in my head or I completely ignore that system.

But also, how do you people think in your minds? I have been wondering that for such a long time but have never actually asked anyone. Also, how many of you would describe your thoughts as 'all over the place' or 'neat'. I think I would describe my thoughts as all over the place. I'm also curious to hear if people only think when they need to. I always am thinking about something no matter what. But what I mean is, do people only start consciously making thoughts when they need to. Like they only think about something when they are doing it. I would really like to hear in detail as to what your thought process is because I would like to see how similar it is to mine.

I'm an overanalytical INFP/J who fell in love with a very loyal ESFJ, we love each other want to get married but she's a few hours away with her huge family all around her.  In the heat of the romance, she was totally committed to moving in with me but has recently started expressing her fears of moving, and compounding to my fears she's since been a lot less lovey-dovey with me.  I tried to assuage her fears being telling her there's no pressure to move in soon, to take her time. A few days ago, I confronted her about it and she got upset and thought I was overthinking things.  She blamed it on the lockdown being lifted and spending more time with her kids.   She has since started calling more often but my spidey sense knows somethings off because her love is not as fierce as it once was.

ESFJ,"Thought you guys would like this post here too, tell me what you think down below.

So this is a post long overdue. My opinion is Nami is an ESFJ and an Fe dom. Nami is not a Te dom or ESTJ in my opinion. I personally don't get where people see this in here, just because she's bossy like I said in the past doesn't mean she's a Te dom, people forget Fe doms are just as bossy and assertive too, while also focusing on respect and other peoples emotions. Nami is emotional, cries all the time like a feeler and not how a emotional thinker does, and is always thinking about other people's emotional state and talking out loud about other peoples emotions. She reads peoples emotions very well, cares about manners, respect, and meeting people's emotional needs. All Fe in Nami, and now I'm gonna tell you why Nami is ESFJ more in depth, share your opinion down below if you agree or disagree after reading.

Now where to begin. Nami like I mentioned before is an Fe dom and ESFJ and I will explain why now. Whenever there is conflict among the crew, similar to Sanji, Nami is always focusing on the emotional state and feelings of the people in conflict or the person. I'm not gonna stereotype here, or put gender roles, or gender stereotypes here. I hate stereotypes myself and are completely against them and always will be. But in this case I think they to a certain extent apply, Sanji is always picking up on someones emotional state and is always thinking of another person's emotions with his Fe, but when he does this when conflict happens amoung the crew he tries to break it up which makes more sense as an ENFJ male which I type him in my opinion, an example of this is when he stopped Chopper in Water 7 and said you need to understand how Usopp is feeling here Chopper, if you pity him he's going to feel even worse from the pity after losing the duel he asked for himself. But Nami is an ESFJ woman and is always picking up on the emotional state of people especially conflict and feels distress, and she's always trying to fix it right then and edge it on to fix the problem or have another character understand how the other character is feeling and apologize or to stop the conflict. She does this when Luffy and Vivi have their fight and argument. When Luffy explains Vivi wanting no one to die in a rebellion and clash with the royal army and then calls her to kind-hearted. Nami reacts and says wait Luffy show some sympathy for Vivi and understand how she's feeling here and she gets emotional and then Sanji stops her after ironically doing the same thing earlier saying a ton of people are going to die and that this is for Vivi and focusing on her emotional state and stress with the situation. Nami also comforted Vivi later in the scene and hugged her. Nami does these things time and time again in the series, these emotional outburst and failing to be logical in the situation and even saying things that are completely illogical a lot of the time and  that don't even make sense when she's getting so emotional on what's happening around her, showing clear inferior Ti in her. When Chopper gets taken away by Foxy in the Davy Back Fight and Zoro scolds him for crying and says they did their best to win and to be tough and accept the loss, Nami yells at Zoro and literally says ""How can you say that?! Don't you know how he feels?!"" This is clear Fe in Nami coming out in this scene. Nami is completely focusing on Chopper's emotional state and feelings in this situation, there is no logic here or efficiency or focusing on the task and what logically happened, this is pure emotion from Nami and focusing on Choppers emotions and feelings from being stolen from the crew by Foxy and how emotional Chopper feels about it and having leave the crew by force of the Davy Back rules, massive Fe in Nami in this scene.

Here's my recent Sanji ENFJ post, if you disagree and want to see my reasoning on him:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/gwr17c/sanji\_enfj\_one\_piece\_mbti\_why\_hes\_an\_fe\_dom\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/gwr17c/sanji_enfj_one_piece_mbti_why_hes_an_fe_dom_and/)

Nami is very emotionally distressed when Usopp and Luffy are arguing in Water 7. Sanji feels Luffy's intense emotions with his Fe especially when Luffy raises his voice and almost tell him to leave, Sanji feel the stress from Luffy and the room and kicks him and feels so emotional about the stress that he's panting in the scene and has a distressed look on his face. And he predicts what he was gonna say in the moment with his Ni and Se. Nami while telling them to stop over and over again, starts trying to edge it on and fix the conflict right away when Usopp leaves, she yells Luffy and everyone telling them aren't you going to stop him, we came all this way and Usopp is our precious friend she says, then she says Luffy stop him your the captain right? And immediately starts crying and tearing up, and then seconds later says why aren't you saying anything? She then runs outs and yells at Usopp to comeback followed by Sanji and Chopper who are also feelers in the group, and then Luffy finally comes out and looks at him with his serious stare, Zoro is the only calm logical one in this situation, and ironically we start seeing Luffy getting emotional and losing his tough serious captain act when Usopp starts talking. I've seen Fe doms do this all the time and want the conflict resolved as soon as possible especially from the emotional stress their feeling and seeing everyone else emotionally in the room stressed out and in a negative state, this is all Fe coming out in Nami over logic which she doesn't use or act like at all in this scene. Her Fe goes even further and further proves this point when Nami literally walks into Luffy's cabin and room and starts yelling at him to fix the situation now and bring him back, she completely edges and pushes this on and is completely emotional in this scene and wants them to make up right away and is further she gets very emotional when their's conflict and responds to other peoples emotions easily, especially in negative situations. And when she does this and has these emotional outbursts with what's happening with people around her, she's completely illogical and can't calm down and see logical inconsistencies, see reason and logical assess things, or be objective and unemotional at all, further proving she has low inferior Ti and high Fe dom behavior. I forgot to mention also before when Usopp declared the duel against Luffy, Nami was confused and emotionally distressed again and said ""What? hey...what are you saying?"" But yeah, again when Nami is screaming at Luffy trying to tell him to stop fighting, she asks ""Why do you have to duel with your friend?!"" ""If you give it time, you two will down, right?!"" She says Usopp just got upset because things were going to fast for him with the news. Luffy then says ""Now that we've come this far, we can't go back."" She fails too see this logically again with her inferior Ti and pointlessly tries to edge it on and fix the problem. And then Nami says ""That's not true!"" ""You can apologize to him and talk it over again!"" Showing Fe conflict resolution and focusing on how two people feel emotionally in a situation and talking it over and fixing and resolving the conflict, major Fe in Nami here. When Luffy explains and she leaves, she later gets pissed when she sees Zoro and Sanji fighting where we see more Fe in Sanji getting mad at Zoro not beating the Franky Family and saying if you had Usopp wouldn't have been attacked and felt guilty with Sanji focusing on Usopp's emotional state again, she yells at them and then tells them to stop, we don't need anymore fighting! Showing her Fe and Si clearly here. During the actual fight she was crying and couldn't hold back her tears the entire time, she emotionally couldn't take the situation at all or stand to see her crewmates fighting like that and broke down emotional from watching them and seeing everything that happened.

Nami was completely emotionally stressed when they went to save Sanji and found him and Luffy and Sanji fought right in front of her. She again couldn't emotionally handle seeing them fight, again like with Luffy vs Usopp, was reacting constantly and emotionally as the fight happened. The pain of watching them affected her so much emotionally that she says something completely illogical and says alright Sanji we'll leave! Just please stop! This is clear Fe dom and inferior Ti in Nami again. She was so emotional again in this scene that she walked up and slapped him and said goodbye with tears in her eyes and then says, ""Sorry, we should have never done this"", showing also she's still considered his emotions to apologize, even after seeing the awful things Sanji did to Luffy and being completely mad at Sanji here. All of this was massive Fe for Nami in this scene during the Luffy vs Sanji fight. And then Nami's Fe comes out again with her motherly Fe moment with the children. She turns around and says I can't leave these kids behind and you can't turn your back on children crying for help, after hearing what the kids say and reacting to the children's emotions in the situation and telling her to comeback and help them get to their families again, Fe moment again for Nami. Nami and Tashigi have a Fe and Si talk about taking care of the kids and being driven by duty and taking responsibility for them to get them to their families. no matter what. This is a very fitting discussion since I type Tashigi ISFJ, so there Fe and Si match up very well here when Tashigi asks to take them instead, but with their functions in different orders ironically. Nami and Tashigi both have a major Fe and Si connection in this moment and its very apparent when you watch the scene.

I could go further but I think these reasons are good enough. Her Si and Ne are pretty clear. She's very detail oriented and driven by security and not tasking risks and duty. She compares and contrasts details with the weather as a navigator and remembers details in her mind very well and recalls past details and events a lot, and those details from the past she remembers affect her decision making. Certain past events affected how she is strongly today like an Si user, like with the Bellemere Arlong thing and collecting the money in her village shaping her greed and obsession with money and jewelry, also I forgot to mention with Nami's Fe dom she can manipulate others and get what she wants by swaying their emotions with her body or other deceitful tactics she tries and sweet talking them and people into get what she wants which Fe is known for when its not used for good. She also has a deep nostalgia to tangerines again with Bellemere. Even though she is more of a Si user her Ne is pretty clear to, at times she is curious about things and always asking questions and wondering why people said something or what's up with something she notices in the world around her. She can be creative in battle to with her imagination and coming up with good idea with the Climatact Usopp made her and adapting to it quickly and its improvements in the series. I already mentioned her Ti inferior and how illogical she gets in the series, but when she's not showing her Ti weakness, Nami is good at deducing things and noticing logical inconsistencies here and there in situations and she's very intelligent and sees loopholes easily at times. But she can't do this enough or that often and completely misses logical in favor of emotion so many times that she's a clear Ti inferior in my opinion from observing her character throughout the series. So that's why I think Nami is a clear ESFJ, tell me what you think down below on the topic. Nami is One Piece at least one of the characters that defines the series, you can't have the series without her, she's an OG character and Straw Hat, and her backstory is one of the saddest. So I wanted to clear up some misconceptions on her and type her accurately at least in my opinion, Nami is not a Fi user, she's a Fe user and I think I did good explanation on why I think so with evidence from the series on each point, I'd like to hear everyone's opinions on this. Also I really agree with this post on here being ESFJ as well, I don't agree with all of their typings for the Straw Hats but I really agree with Nami's post on here that they did. The only Straw Hats typings I agree with that this site did that I personally agree on, are Luffy, Nami, and Zoro. The rest of the Straw Hats that they typed, I personally disagree with in my opinion but you can decide for yourself your thoughts, thanks for reading.

The post I agree with, even if I only agree with some of the Straw Hats here:

ESFJ,"INFJ here. When I was little, I used to think my dad was really reserved and disconnected from our family. Still, I felt this odd sense that he was probably right for being that way, in some weird line of thinking that felt like backward logic to me, and in reality probably wasn’t and I was just missing something. 

Now, in my twenties looking back, I’m realizing that we had a very dysfunctional family, and the two of us (though he was in his thirties and I was a child) were in the same boat of realizing all the social injustices at play, while also feeling the need to not do anything about it. I ended up leaving that community fueling that false narrative, and as a result, my overall outlook is greatly improved. Now, I’m feeling like I’m abandoning my sister, who’s still living at home and thus can’t leave like I was able to. No one was better at helping me understand why that was than my dad. My FJ makes me want to save her, but my IN is over-idealizing the situation. The best thing to do is give her the space she needs to come to her own conclusions, just like he allowed for me. 

Funny that now I realize, he wasn’t reserved or disconnected, and he probably looked at me and thought I was the same way. He was probably sensing my inner turmoil, and it was killing him inside that he couldn’t take affirmative action and save me. He also helped me realizing that this idea of a larger collective not understanding me, while it might feel real, isn’t necessarily true in practicality. He helped me understand that the larger collective understood me more than I thought they did. 

To all you ESFJ dads out there with little INFJs, you’re probably doing wayyyyyyy more good than you think you are. I was internalizing his idea of allowing me to ask questions, and then also taking his answers and taking them way farther than he realized. His ideals shaped who I am today, and I think I’m pretty cool lol.

ESFJ,"Hi everyone, I'm Derek (ENTJ). My friends and I recently launched an MBTI based dating app and have gotten thousands of sign ups already. After much tweaking, we finally wanted to share this with you in the hopes that this may help you find like-minded friends and loved ones.

We felt like current dating apps were really inefficient. They help you meet more people, not more of the right people. This means wasted time, money, and emotional preparation on bad dates with no chemistry. It's not just bad dates; the time and effort from swiping, messaging, arranging dates, and preparing both emotionally and physically, just for dates to continuously not work out, has led to dating fatigue and the sense that online dating is hopeless. It's also hard to tell what a person is actually like through text, only to be disappointed after meeting or the first month of dating.

What we as MBTI enthusiasts have always known is that who we are (personality type) tends to influence the kinds of people we're attracted to, and it doesn't make sense for this not to play a part in mainstream online dating.

We wanted to create a radically authentic, transparent, and empathetic dating experience where people can feel free to be themselves, because it is exactly by being yourself that the right person will come along and like and appreciate you for who you naturally are. On Boo, if someone matched with you, they’re already aware of your best and worst traits, and still decided they’d rather have you over any other type. On Boo, you’re already what each other are looking for.

As an ESFJ, caring is at the nature of your personality. You're practical, loyal, empathize easily with others, and are sensitive to other's needs. But at your worst, you can be inflexible, criticism averse, and needy. You’ll want someone who sees the world as you do and loves you for your best, but also understands and forgives you at your worst, and would have it no other way. 

Our app is completely free, and you can download on our Website: **https://boo.dating**

We hope you like Boo, and please share any feedback for us, on here or at (email: support at boo.dating) we'd love to hear your thoughts on how we can improve the experience!",1590287948

ESFJ,"Hi, just a random INFP coming through. You see, my aunt got into ""cleaning mode"" because of the quarantine, and of course, she's really stressed about it. And, since she's stressed she tends to scream at me over the smallest details like: ""you forgot to sweep under here"", and then she proceeds to add more and more stuff that have nothing to do with the present issue, just to make me feel guilty, then she calms down, and then she starts screaming again.   


Today I woke up and oh surprise, she didn't scream at me. I tried to be as invisible as posible, as I hate confrontation. But then she called me and said that she left something for me at the table. Turns out it was my favorite food. It's not the first time she does this, she first leaves me crying and then she's like: ""Hey, I know I made you cry yesterday, but I made your favorite food!"" 

My question is, is she trying to buy my pardon? Is this just a common thing for you all? Does she think that this positive action outweighs the bad actions of yesterday? Or is she just trying to feel better with herself?",1586196638

ESFJ,"I’ve known MBTI and Jung’s take on typology for over 3 years now and only up to recently did I realise I was actually an ESFJ. Now I’ve never gone with any of the stereotypes and negatively judging sensors and specifically SJ types like a lot of the community shows (it’s pretty evident that this happens) as I’ve always thought of myself as an ISFP.

It was until I quizzed multiple people on MY personality, I think it was 5 others separately who know me well enough. They all said the same things aka that I fit more with ESFJ than anything else, keep in mind none of them know anything specifically about MBTI itself so there’s no bias there.

I was kind of baffled when they all said basically the same thing, it all makes sense now I always thought there was something wrong with me fitting as an ISFP. I know mixing the two is a little strange considering they are quite different but I’m not the healthiest of people mentally tbh.

I'm an ENFJ just dropping by to write some appreciation. I think of all the 16 Myers Briggs types, the ESFJ and the ISTJ are the least appreciated, so I wanted to share the love. 

Everyone goes on about how selfless the ENFJ is, but I often wonder where the appreciation is for our Sensing cousins?! 

This is close to me because my grandmother is an ESFJ, and she's one of the most genuinely altrustic people I've ever met. She's incredible at bringing people together and has an amazing charm and social grace that I don't really have. She's also ferociously intelligent and very people oriented, and knows how to work people. I know a few other ESFJs who appear to fit this pattern, and I'm constantly amazed.

I (an ISFP) have been somehow texting her for a lot recently, and what I know about her so far about her is that she's apparently really smart but gets bored in class easily, likes sports alot, and we're both pretty into guitar memes/rock music. We seem to have quite a bit in common except  I'm super less organized and don't really care about my grades, and that I'm wayyyyyyy more introverted.

I'm INTP and I'm starting a relationship with one ESFJ, and it is going well, she is very affectionate and we get along very well together, I also think she is not a strong E because she is quite shy and likes a lot just spends nights at home watching movies etc..

I don't think neither that the problem is related to me because she would have told me I think (I hope tbh XD), but I really want to help her. Though without information on what the problem is I don't know how to do it, and I ends up just says useless generic things, and I'm afraid maybe she thinks I don't care when instead I really do.

What is something that you ESFJ wanted to receive when troubled?",1585042652
ESFJ,"I can't tell if she's ESFJ or ESTJ

&amp;#x200B;

ESTJ:

\- Goal-oriented and achieving: She sets goals and tries hard to climb the ladder at work. Some people believe she's somewhat a workaholic because she works hard and efficiently at work. 

\- Accounting: She chose to major in accounting because she's good with numbers and she wanted a stable job with pretty good income. Although she's an accountant, she has goals to further her career to hit six figures.

\- Organized: She's a clean, organized person who likes keeping her home very neat and proper. She keeps a planner and a calendar, too.

\- Planner: Whenever we go on vacations, she plans ahead of time when precisely she'll purchase tickets, what we'll be doing there, etc. She also plans how she intends to climb the ladder at work. She doesn't usually do things at last minute.

\- Impatient: She rushes things very frequently, wants to get to places as soon as possible, tries to get things over with quickly, and gets road rage really often even though she doesn't honk at people much.

\- Aggressive: Her body language can come across a bit aggressive and she can seem a bit intimidating because of her strong energy. She's also very good at things like claiming the last free sample in a huge crowd.

\- Judgmental: She's quick to judge other people's character/behavior/appearance, drawing her own assumptions about them.

&amp;#x200B;

ESFJ:

\- Cares what people think of her: She cares more about her image than her reputation, but she's still extremely concerned about both. She needs people to think highly of her and to like her. She's constantly wondering what people think of her and the rest of the family. It's like she's on high alert, constantly analyzing if someone might think something negatively if she were to do this or that. She also cares to impress people, so she'll do things like humbly brag about herself and the family, buy materialistic items, etc.

\- Very fake: She pretends to be extremely selfless and wants everyone to know it. She'll get gifts from people then regift them to others without getting caught. She exaggerates how much she likes people, how nice she is, and more. She'll compliment someone for minutes then talk shit about them shortly after. Once she recorded a video of herself giving a homeless a Target gift card and posted it online for others to think she's selfless and caring, but the gift card was actually already all used up.

\- Manipulative: She's good with words and acting, so it's easy for her to fool people into believing her. She constantly lies about things for her gain and benefit. 

\- Warm: Many people find her very friendly, approachable, and charming. She's easy to talk to and it isn't hard for people who don't know her well to like her. She usually makes a good impression on others. She smiles and laughs a lot around others, so people think she's really nice and easygoing.

\- Tries to fit into whatever crowd she's with: She's somewhat a chameleon because she'll change certain personality traits about herself as well as her behavior depending on who she's with. She also will pretend to be interested in things they're interested in.

\- Talkative and outgoing: She likes to go out with her friends when she's free, is very chatty, and can talk for many hours if she's with people she enjoys talking to. 

\- Dramatic: She isn't dramatic every minute of every day, but whenever something happens, she'll be very dramatic about it. For example, once my brother got into a fight at school. When she found out about it, she went pretty crazy, crying hysterically about how her image is ruined because he decided to make an embarrassment out of himself and the family. It isn't unusual for her to have these dramatic meltdowns whenever something happens that makes her look bad/embarrassing.",1585002360
ESFJ,"Hello! :)

Lately I have asked myself, if there are connections/relationships between the Myer-Briggs-Types we like the most and our own type. So I wanted to make a survey to find out the ""favorite"" types of each Myer-Briggs-Type.

If you have, can you please tell **up to three** personality types (**excluding your own**) you like interacting with most and with which you prefer to spend your time with. Just the one you like the most.

**For example**:  
I am Enfp and I like XXXX, XXXX and XXXX the most

Since the mbti community has 88k Members and the Enfp community alone has 42k members, I decided that I would post this post on each subreddit of each type because I want as much answers as possible. So sorry in advance if you might see this post more than once

And yes, I know that even within one personality type, the people differ, we are all individuals. But from my experience with people with different personality types I can say that, in general I liked a specific personality type more than an other.

Had I not done this I would've believed my gf is a narcissist but seeing the her traits and tendencies described in many mbti articles I grew to look past her ways and learn to accept her for who she is. But I feel like our differences in function makes us collide. We don't really understand each other however we just try and accept each other. It really bothers me that she doesn't have or use any Ni and Ti. My lack of Se irritates her as well. We just have a very different way of looking at the world and there were some attempts by the both of us to try to change reach others way of thinking. But I felt it would've been immoral of me to do so and gave up on it completely. She had this tendency to try and force her beliefs unto me but stopped doing it as much when I called her out on her behavior. We both feel guilty afterwards when ever we collide. We both want to maintain harmony above all so for the most part we get along very well but I'm sure it's a mutual feeling where we feel misunderstood and somewhat unfulfilled as a result.

He claimes, I dont want to break you heart as an excuse, even though we never overtely talked about a relationship... he just seemed to make this up...and then when I said, I am convinced he would not, we claimed I would stalk and restrict his freedom... I am an INTJ, certainly I dont take freedom, everone my whole life told me I would take to much!!!!! This is so enoying.

I feel this ifs what he needs, but I feel really angry, because I think his claims were unjustified and do not want to admit. It feels always amazing with him and I would love to be with him, even as a frind would be find, just do not want to loose him.

Well, guess everything started with me texting and complaining, that he should worry less about my feelings (after he said, he don't want to break my heart), because I was concerned to loose him. 

AAAh, he just never questions himself seemingly!! 

What can I do to tell him in a nice way, that he has wrong assumptions about me?

 He seems to take criticism very badly, while I can hardly stand beeing sensitive. He feels interested, but he is not showing it. I cannot make sense of his assumptions about me? He is so good with people, how can he be so wrong and think, I dont respekt him? (I acctually very much do)

Or is this a form of manipulation you would do, to make closed people open up? And does he now wait for me secretely to confess?

ESFJ,"Is it a common thing for you to not want to talk about the past? I've got an ESFJ in my life that I have a lot of history with. We're both in happier and healthier places but as we're trying to rebuild our relationship after some major incidents that led to us spending time apart I think we both owe each other an apology. Neither of us handled the situation well and we both said and did hurtful things. He was the one to reach out and speak to me against after almost two years. It was a big surprise because the way we left it I thought we'd never speak again. I was happy to hear from him despite how we'd left it. 

Sometimes I dwell on the past and analyse situations maybe too much. I like analysing the past and former relationships. The good, the bad, the other. I like talking about things with hindsight. I like finding a new path forwards. I like getting closure. It's also important for me to hear the other persons side of the story, and to share mine so we can be sure we're on the same page. It's important to me because I want to have my feelings acknowledged, I want to acknowledge theirs, and then I want to move forward. 

This ESFJ is willing to reminisce about good times but gets quiet when I raise bad situations. He tells me I dwell too much on the past and shouldn't live in the past. He tells me he doesn't see the point in going over the past and gets a little agitated or aggressive over it. Which is fine, I won't force him to talk if he doesn't want to, but in order for us to move forward with a new healthy friendship I would like some closure and acknowledgement of where we went wrong.

ESFJ,"Hello, thanks for the response in advance if any!

In general I've met some really nice ESFJ people and I appreciate your social skills and knowledge about ""The group"" as a whole in terms of reading and responding to emotions. I had a situation at work the other day and made a post about it on the r/istp subreddit and I got two great responses. I also spoke about it with my INTP friend and the solution we came up with is to tell people how I feel (basically) because people can't know what bothers me unless I tell them that it bothers me.

**In the nicest way possible, how do I tell the group to not cut me off in conversation?** If left up to me, I'd say it bluntly, and have in the past said it bluntly and it did not turn out well. The reason why I don't like being cut off is because I rarely rarely share my opinions and thoughts with others. So when I'm sharing and I get cut off, it feels like people don't care about what I'm saying. I assume that if people know that it bothers me so much, they probably would cut me off, and then after they're finished talking bring the focus back to what I was saying. Which I'm fine with. 

Anyway **tl;dr - How do I tell people not to cut me off in conversations in the nicest way possible?** Here's the original post for more context. Thank you!

&amp;#x200B;

 

**EDIT: I realize that I posted this a solution and not a question so if you came for a solution on how to deal with Inferior Fe, I apologize!**

Before I start inferior Fe is basically actively detaching yourself from social situations for a number a possible reasons. I think below sums up what I felt today. Btw, I'm a 24M.

\-Demonic Fi: I do not feel as though my opinions have been fully considered, and at the core of my being, I secretly feel rejected and alienated by others. I would rather isolate myself entirely than participate in a society which callously marginalizes or outright dismisses what I deem to be proper and rational. Anything is better than conforming for the sake of conforming.

Today I decided to be more outgoing and open at work, much more than I usually am. I was actively trying to be myself outside of work, who I feel like is a lot more loose and interesting. I was sharing my opinions/ideas to a group of my coworkers today and someone cut me off with a completely different subject and the whole group started talking about that other topic. I immediately get up from the table and take off alone. I'm annoyed but it's nothing serious. I recover but later on the same thing happens. We were in a group meeting, someone cut me off with a completely different subject and the group once again completely disregarded what I was saying. I was hot and since I was in a meeting, I kept my face on upset and looked only in one direction. Didn't say a single word for 2 hours.

In the moment I realized I was upset, and I also realized that to the outside world I look mad. I fully understood that my Inferior Fe has taken over my other functions besides Ti. To me, it felt like they didn't care about what I was saying, so it made me not want to say anything at all. They also keep bringing up how great and amazing these other 3-4 coworkers are but they never say anything like that about me. So in my mind, they don't really like me as much as they say they do... Or that that's a possibility.

In reality, it was probably very unintentional both times and I see that now, but how can I conquer that in the moment and not dissociate from the group. I really want to be a person where everyone can say oh I really like [u/Fuzakenna\_](https://www.reddit.com/u/Fuzakenna_/) he's a cool guy, but that doesn't happen by randomly being upset seemingly out of nowhere.

Edit: Where's my manners, thanks for the responses in advance, if any!",1583624527

Basically, I'm not great at critical thinking and/or logic as the NTs are. With that in mind, my decision making abilities aren't as great and I'm not confident in my decisions entirely.

HOWEVER, the NTs that I hang with are great at analyzing and making deductions, and when I'm around them, I'm very confident in making the decision they've deduced when they feel unconfident. I'd say it's a high percentage that I decide correctly.

Here's an example:
We'll play a card game that requires us to have a team that has to guess which two cards a person selected. We have 5 turns to select the right two cards, and on each turn we are given clues. Usually by the end, the team will be stuck on 2-3 options, but everytime I hear their reasoning for the right one, I feel like a shitload of neurons make connections (not sure if that it right). And I always pick the answers right based on what they think. I'd say, I'm like 90% based off the countless times we've played.

Anyways, it's just a game, but I also feel like NTs have helped me a lot in life by providing pretty top notch advice (i.e. salary negotiation, and professional career advice).

\-Don't post like ""XXXX showing my suport for ESTJs"", that's just drawing attention to your own type. We're here to support them, not to promote ourselves.

ESFJ,"Hello!

My husband is an ESFJ and I myself an INFP. I was wondering what careers you ESFJ's have or what you think an ESFJ would suit. I'm asking this because my husband had a burn out last year and now that he is full time at work again, he is really questioning his accounting job. He works at a big corporate firm and loves working with numbers and creating structure and order. But, as an ESFJ his need for affirmation and serving others is not very satisfied in his current job. Although he has some nice colleagues who he sees outside of work, he can get very upset when confronted with asshole managers/clients who don't appreciate his expertise. I personaly think he discovered his ""feeling-side"" during his burn out. He was (and still is) very hard on himself but really had to face his emotional side I think. 

Do you have some advise? A little more about his personal interests: he is super dedicated to his sports (triathlon, cycling). In an impulse he said he might as well wanted to be a sport nutrition coach, medical sports doctor (but was disappointed to read that he should have studied medicines) or ""just run a cycle shop in France with a friend"". In his free time he also loves playing with excel sheets for his sports activities, making them more efficient; he is also exploring the world of data and website building. Interested in cooking (for others) or just making sure our friends are having a good time at our place with enough wine and cheese ;)

I hope you have some thoughts about this. Of course I talk a lot about this with him and my friends, but maybe an outside view from people of the same type helps us along.",1582630241

ESFJ,"A friend who I've known for eight months seeming got hurt/pissed with something I've said for two days in a row. It's the first time they ever expressed they're annoyed. I confessed to them, and they didn't believe me or thought I was confused. I told them I had to stop talking with them for a while until I get rid of my feelings, and they said they'll pretend they never read my message. Or we could talk about itn

While chatting, I told him, maybe they wasn't really friends with me but talking to me because I help them out with some things. They got upset and asked me, aren't we friends???? I talk to you because I like talking with you. They talked to me a lot after that, opened up about a lot of things, and he helped me out with my studies. Which they rarely do.

The next day they ignored my message, and my insecurity/paranoia got the best of me. So I thought, maybe they secretly hates me. I tried sending them a message a few hours later, to show him something they might be interested in, and they seemed cold with their reply. Later they told me they were busy. I told them, I felt he was. But maybe they hated me. I said that as a joke but... they took it differently.

They sent me an angry emoji. I forgot what I said after but they clarified that they didn't like what I said, like it was out of place(?) There might have been a language barrier as we were using our respective native languages. I told them they don't have to reply to me anymore (since they're busy) and that I don't want to make them angry or stressed.

When I get upset at people, I usually can forgive them but I need time away from them, so I can release my annoyance. Then, I can talk to them like usual, as long as they're not overly apologetic or dense/committing the same mistakes. 

I told myself it doesn't matter if we stop talking, or if our connection ends now. What's meant to be will be meant to be. But I'm curious if ESFJs act in a certain way. 

I'm curious if it means they're done with the friendship, or they just need time, or it means they trust me with a different side of them. They've expressed how tired and stressed they were and I feel a bit bad about adding to that. 

I think it's best I stay away from him, so as to lessen potential additional stress. I'm thinking of just never messaging them again unless they initiate and let me know I'm welcome to talk to them. And if they ignore me, I guess that means they're done with the friendship.

I've met this girl almost 3 years ago where she was dating a younger guy, which makes sense as she is a nurturing ""protective"" kind of person, whom hates change. The guy's a cool dude and she soon left interstate to study.

&amp;#x200B;

She's back now and we kicked it off again, as we have a lot of mutual friends. I really feel a deep connection with this girl and I feel like I'm falling in love with her. There's a long list of things I like about her, and when I can't find faults and make excuses of their shortcomings that's when I know.   


&amp;#x200B;

Strange as we don't talk about the existence of the universe and abstract topics. I'm big into music and she is tone deaf. We spoke daily for almost 2 weeks and have always kept in touch. She treats me almost as her boyfriend feeding me food and asking for things etc and I've complied. She offers to wash my clothes and wanted to do things for me. We spoke every day and met up frequently until last week. It seems like she suddenly didn't want to give me attention anymore and backed off. 

&amp;#x200B;

The most weird and strange thing about all this is the exact time last year when she was still interstate she broke up with her boyfriend (which lasted a grand total of 5 days) and she was speaking to me for reassurance during that time. Last year we spoke for 2 weeks every day, on the phone etc then suddenly she didn't want my attention anymore and back off. LITERALLY THE EXACT THINGS HAPPEN AGAIN THIS YEAR in mid January. 

&amp;#x200B;

Oh yeah forgot to mention the small detail as she's still dating this guy whom is 5 years my junior. I find their relationship almost mother/son like. Bare in mind they both come from well off families and the boyfriend is a great guy and genuinely nice. I don't want to ruin their relationship per say, but it's hard to avoid liking someone as it's very irrational. 

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr - Like a girl in a long term relationship. She gives me attention and acts interested for a couple of weeks. Suddenly backs off and I get a different vibe from our conversations. Not sure what to make of it. She's a hard ESFJ, but maybe I should post this in /r/relationships as well?

ESFJ,"Hello ESFJs,

Attached are my cousin's cognitive function results. I believe that he is an ESFJ at his core, but he is possibly one of the most unhealthy *people*, let alone ESFJs, to walk this earth. 

I've read that ESFJs need community, my cousin was born without one. He was raised on a farm under religious and manipulative parents. He never went to school, never had a solid friend group, and he never had much contact with people outside his family. He was treated like, for lack of a better word, a lazy fuck by his father, for his Fe was almost completely useless to his family of culty narcissists. His practical ISTP younger brother out shined him in every way that his father cared about (which was pretty much just manual labor) and he was essentially treated like a dumb, useless piece of shit throughout his whole childhood.

He moved off the farm and away from his parents controlling lunacy at about 20 years old, so roughly four years ago. He initially moved in with our aunt and uncle who were highly supportive and even offered to pay for him to go to school, but he refused and did what he always did on the farm; drinking and playing video games. He got a job at the local supermarket in the meat department and made a bunch of lowbrow friends that introduced him to cocaine. He maintained this addiction until he moved in with me about 8 months ago.

After our aunt and uncle moved, my cousin moved in with his cocaine friends and suffered a traumatic event where his roommate tried to kill himself and he was subsequently ejected from his home as his other roommate cancelled the lease the next day. He found another place to live for a few months before he asked to move in with me, which I accepted.

This poor man is now an empty husk of a human being. He cannot pinpoint his desires, he cannot seize opportunities presented to him, and he seems to be incapable of doing anything but drinking, playing video games, and looking at memes. He cannot get a relationship because his hygiene is terrible, his living space is horrifically filthy, and everything he touches smells like rotting food.

I have talked to him and we both understand that he is not happy with how he lives. He is never belligerent, but no matter how excited he seems to get about improving his station, he never follows up with action. I have brought him into my social circle and done my best to include him in my activities but he usually declines to participate. If he does not decline, he usually just looks at his phone instead of participating in whatever it is I have invited him to do. His natural social prowess is astonishing, and everyone who has ever met him loves him, however this appreciation of his personality doesn't get through to him. I share tips on how to improve his hygiene, but every time he employs a tactic that will help him grow and improve, he drops another. It's like he can only focus on improving one thing at a time.

I think he needs to establish himself in a social group and find some sense of belonging in the world through validation from others, but he will never go to a church because of his past (and frankly I won't either). I know he will do whatever I ask him, but like I said earlier, he only seems to be able to do one thing at a time. I need to find ONE THING that I can convince him to do which will get him started on his path to growth. He has lived with me for about 8 months under the agreement that I was going to help him get his life on track and the only change he has made was when I dragged him to Ikea to buy a dresser so his clean and dirty clothes wouldn't get mixed up.

tl;dr cousin/roommate is an ESFJ from an abusive household who never had his Fe nurtured and now is 24 with the mental development of a small child who can only follow one suggestion at a time. I need a suggestion on something I can have him do to help him see his value as a person and start growing into a functioning and fulfilled adult.

ESFJ,"Recently I've gotten close to an ESFJ but our functions are pretty  much the opposite. So sometime I find it hard to be their support when they need it most. (Especially because as an INTP my strong suit isn't with emotion or anything close to it) They're very important to me so when I feel like when I can't help them emotionally I feel like I've let them down. 
Here are a few of the things I'm trying to do to help them when they're in a bad place
1. Just listen to them talk. (Though I have a hard time trying not to ""fix"" their problem) 
2. Remind them that I'm there and I support them in anything and everything. As well as telling them how much I appreciate them and who they are.
3. Occasionally try to cheer them up with a found memory or joke.

Is there anything else I can do? As an INTP it's hard for me to always be there emotionally but I'm learning to put myself second and try to learn them and do what is best for them.
And how can I really reinforce that they can come to me whenever they need?",1578790262

ESFJ,"Hey guys! 

So I'm an INFP and I will be moving in with an ESFJ in March. We get along fine but there are a few things I'm worried about, and I was wondering if you could give me some advice. Thanks!

1) He's very tight with money: We are both in relatively good financial situations (although in different ways), but he's very cheap. In group situations, he's always the one concerned about how the bill is going to be taken care of, and he always asks about the price of things. I get that he wants to be frugal, but at the same time he has bragged about his income (not excessively, but it's over 3x mine) and paired with his cheapness it comes across in really poor taste. At the same time though, he really values quality food and will not bat an eye at dropping $50 on a bottle of wine. Where I'm expecting this to come into play is buying food for the house. I'm very free with my money. I would prefer to keep food communally--if I buy something, it's totally ok that he eats it. However, he wants to keep completely separate pantries. I understand that he wants to not be taken advantage of, but I fear that I'll end up being taken advantage of because I really don't care if he eats my food. I just don't want to be the only one buying food. Secondly, eating out/doing things is another area where money becomes a potential spoiler. Since I'm relatively in a comfortable situation for a single college guy, I often treat when going out with friends. I just enjoy it. If there's something I want to do and someone in the group can't because of finances, I'll usually always offer to take care of it for them. My friend though will often turn down a night at the movies for money reasons, and then turn around and brag about his investment plans the next minute. It seems really selfish and I fear it will hinder our ability to go do things. 

2) Personal space: I'm a lot more extroverted than many INFPs, but I'm still an introvert. I need my time alone. I'll have my own room, which is going to be really nice, but if things ever turn sour between us, I'm going to feel really trapped. Even if things are fine, I'm afraid I'll end up getting sick of being around him since he's really talkative. I don't want to end up being a jerk and resenting him for just being friendly, but it's going to be necessary for me to have some quiet alone time in order for me not to resent him. Also, I'm afraid that he's going to be really clingy when I try to go out an join new groups/find new friends. I'd really like to take the opportunity of moving to a new city to work on forging my own life and improving my own confidence in social situations without having him as a crutch. Also, I feel like if he's involved in all my friend circles I'll end up getting tired of spending time with him, and even tying my identity to him, leading into more need for me to be alone in the house. When I talked to him about this, he said that he won't have any problem giving me that, but I do have a few doubts. Leading into my third item:

3) He's very averse to conflict and easily takes things personally: Again, I'm not really a typical INFP in this regard, but I feel like conflict is really necessary and even good in certain situations. I'm not at all afraid of telling him what he's doing that aggravates me, but I'm a bit reserved on it since I can tell he's not as personally secure as he could be. I don't want to come across as harsh, but I just know that there's going to be some things I'll have to confront him on. What's the best way to do this? I can fully recognize that I can be difficult to live with, and I'm going to work on this. Currently the people I live with have told me that they've taken my introverted and messy nature as disrespectful and cold. I don't want him to get the wrong idea and think I resent him when I'm just being me. 

4) Fourth and final thing: He and I have completely different tastes in media. It may sound superficial, but there's not a ton of media that we like in common. Pretty much it's just comedies. He tends to actively avoid things that are emotionally deep or that have long and complex plots. Similarly, during our conversations, it can often feel like we just talk about meaningless things. Don't get me wrong, we do have quite a few mutual interests, but whenever the conversation turns philosophical, he just shuts off. I think this is the N/S difference, but I feel like it's hard to really connect to him due to this difference. 

Thanks again for the advice. Sorry if I come across as condescending, but hopefully I can better understand how I might aggravate him and avoid that, as well as make sure I'm not walked over.",1577934995
ESFJ,"If you are like me, you get called nice by almost everyone, but somehow I started to really dislike this compliment, I don't really know the exact reason why, but I think that I want people to see more than that (?)

ESFJ,"When I first took the test, I got infp, and as a person who always wanted to be E, and didn't know about cognitive functions, I retook the test almost every month until I got ENFP. 

Later I talked to someone who told me they don't think I'm intuitive, and then introduced to the cognitive functions, and I agreed, I started KNOWING that I'm a sensor, and that I use Fe. 

At that time, I never read about ESFJ, because I was too busy learning about cognitive functions and typing the person who told me they think I'm a sensor (they were confused about their type too, and I think they were INFJ... that's besides the point)

Anyway I read ESFJ today! I was so happy! because I KNEW I wasn't MAKING myself relate, I was ACTUALLY relating, and hekk yeah man! I took A LOT of tests, they always gave me different answers.

I also relate a lot to enfps as you can tell by my profile, actually I was kind of figuring out how enfps work and basically posting whenever I do something that is slightly 'enfp' and guess what? I usually get it right! lol

She doesn't listen but keeps on saying ""I know"" or ""I can control them"" or ""I don't need your help"". After she said that we moved the party from the main house to the garage house because main house doesn't have any locks in the bedrooms which means anyone can steal shit and the furniture is expensive. but the garage house was empty since were still finding renters so it was fine. 

We knew that this party was going to be fucked because underage drinkers and wild.

I also have an ESFJ Grandmother that tries her hardest to love me and treat me as equally as all her other grandchildren although I always get this feeling that I am annoying her every time I visit.  

I thought we were best friends, but I have come to learn that although she loves me as a sister, my sister also finds me unbearably annoying. And she won't let me know why! She thinks it's too obvious to answer. As for my Grandmother. She is a truly remarkable person who always treats me fairly, but I make so many genuine but serious social mistakes I'm worried it is permanently damaging our ability to even like each other.

This is great and all but his priorities always seem to be his family then school then sports/group chats about sports then sleep then me. And I’m tired of feeling like the last priority and I feel taken for granted and like an addition to the life he wants to live. How do I approach telling him that? I’ve tried a bunch of times but clearly I’m not communicating my points across.  Also I feel like he doesn’t actively listen to things I say like if I’m not being dramatic then he simply brushes off things I say or want.

ESFJ,"How Does Personality Type Affect Feelings of Loneliness? 

I recently conducted some research on loneliness via a survey, and the responses I got from people blew me away. 

I knew that it was a problem, but I didn’t realize how MUCH of a problem it was until the survey blew up, got over a thousand responses overnight, and people kept messaging me asking about the results. 

As promised, I’d like to share the results of the survey for everyone to benefit from. 

Note: on this post I will be sharing the “Personality Type” insights from the survey. For the non-personality type insights, read my post in another sub [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeNewFriendsHere/comments/eesy16/results_from_the_survey_about_loneliness_for_a/). 

The goal with the survey was to use the data to determine how big of a problem loneliness really is, and then eventually create a program that aims to “cure” loneliness. 

By “cure,” I mean take someone that struggles with loneliness at 7/10 or higher and bring that down to 3/10 or lower by improving their situation or mental state. 

The survey was quite barebones, but that was intentional. It ended up giving a ton more data than I could’ve predicted. 

Here are the fascinating “Personality Type vs. Loneliness” insights uncovered, thanks to all of your help: 

“Does Personality Type affect susceptibility to high feelings of loneliness?” Yes, it does. 

Why that is, I’m not exactly sure… So let me share with you the data, and together we can talk about it. 

The LEAST LONELY personality type on average is the ESTJ, with average feelings of loneliness reported at 4.86/10. 

The MOST LONELY personality type on average is the INFP, with average feelings of loneliness reported at 6.9/10. 

Note that the ESTJ &amp; INFP do not share any similar letters- and each letter compared with each other had consistently different levels of loneliness. 

E’s average feelings of loneliness is 5.54, whereas I’s have 6.26. 

S’s average feelings of loneliness is 5.49, whereas N’s have 6.27. 
T’s average feelings of loneliness is 5.74, whereas F’s have 6.12. 

J’s average feelings of loneliness is 5.87, whereas P’s have 6.01. 

This trend held true between all other personality types. For example, the INFJ was the second most lonely personality type, at 6.8 average feelings of loneliness. 

The more INFP letters you have, the more likely you are to feel lonely, and vice versa for the ESTJ letters. 

The top three least lonely personality types are ESTJ (4.86), ESFJ (5), and ESTP (5). 

The top three most lonely personality types are INFP (6.9), INFJ (6.8), and ENFJ (6.54). 

That is all for personality type- for all other insights about this project, review the full report [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeNewFriendsHere/comments/eesy16/results_from_the_survey_about_loneliness_for_a/).

ESFJ,"I’m a shy ESFJ here. I’ve never met anyone else on Reddit who has explicitly told others that they are shy so I thought I might do this.

- - - - - - - - - -

lil backstory:

I used to think I was an ISFJ. When I took the quiz on 16personalities this is what it told me I was. 

But I started reading about the ESFJ and thought I identified with that a lot more than the ISFJ. I’ve never seen myself as the most considerate (ISFJ) and thought I had more capabilities of matching the ESFJ profile. 

My mum also got typed as an ISFJ which I can totally see - she enjoys her own company and can also end up sacrificing herself by helping others at her own cost, but I don’t see myself similar to my mum at all.

At one point when I was low and depressed, I stopped doing the activities I used to love doing, and stopped doing my homework, seeing friends, etc. I remember entering a cycle of “I’m lonely because I’m depressed, and depressed because I’m lonely”. I started getting typed as an ISFP which was unexpected. But I’ve never seen myself this way, when I read the ISFP profile I was really disappointed that that’s what 16personalities gave me.

- - - - - - - - - -

So I’m a shy ESFJ and that was part of the process of discovering I was one. I spend a lot of my time at home alone, living with just me an my ISFJ mother, who would rather take free-time to herself. It gets boring sometimes, I can get tired when I’m home alone for too long and would rather be in company of others. 

But I’m still v shy even around others and that can lower my confidence and stop me from socialising sometimes.

ESFJ,"Hey there; this might a little long...

So, yesterday my boyfriend (INTP, 25) and me (ESFJ,22) went to the mall just to hang out, and as we were walking he wanted to take a look at the Microsoft store so we went in and he was looking at this new elite controller they got while I was just wandering around till I saw this Xbox one X NBA Edition and I thought it was really cool ( I really like the design of it, and the controller but I know at the moment that’s not why you get a console for). Anyways, he got me a Xbox one S with two controllers and a 3 month membership for gold pass for it; it was a really good price for all that and he knew I wanted it so he got it for me for Christmas. But, before passing the Microsoft store we went to the legos store (they’re one of our favorites thing to do but we don’t get them to build them as often because they’re kinda expensive) and he would not let me buy a set for us to do that same day because he said he didn’t want me to spend the money on him. Now, when we were back at the Microsoft store, he told me that I should get him that controller as a Christmas present (even though I already got him a terrarium for his gecko; I also think he wasn’t trying to be like oh buy me this, he was just being honest of what he’d like) so this is where my mind went to like “well you wouldn’t let me buy a 60$ set of legos that we can do together but you want me to get you a controller that’s 170$” and my feelings for really hurt. When I told him I wanted that Xbox one X but he got a little defensive and started saying that I didn’t need a Xbox with such power because I wasn’t gonna play everyday because of school and work. So like, is it bad I want that Xbox one X even though he already got me one? I know both of them do the same thing, and it’s only the design that changes (besides the technology side). I tried to talk to him about it but he got a little hurt when I told him my perspective of getting him a controller instead of the LEGO set that we could’ve done together. I honestly don’t know.

She is an absolute joy to be around. She makes friends effortlessly, and succeeds at everything she tries - and she's never afraid to try new things! She's confident (probably to a fault), funny, friendly, and outgoing. She's a force to be reckoned with. She's been so much fun to parent - she's made me so proud. She's been in YouTube videos that have gone viral, she's become a name that's recognizable in our school district for her athleticism and personality, and she's charmed every single adult she's ever talked to since she was a toddler - chattering away about whatever is interesting to her at the moment, excited about everything.

I never tried to figure out what her personality type was, but it's always been clear she's an 'E' (as I'm sure is obvious by my description). But the past year has been eye-opening for me, and the more her personality develops and the more she seems to be so much like I was at her age, the more I'm terrified. And I've come to decide she's probably an ESFJ, as am I. You'd think that would make you connect with each other more?

We allow her to have Snapchat and TikTok, etc, as long as we are able to see everything she posts. Over the past six months, I've seen some things that have worried me, and I've seen many things that have annoyed me. I'm not afraid to admit it. I ""hear"" myself at her age so much in the things she posts, and it digs up a lot of embarrassment and... well, honestly, shame. Crazy to think that two decades later, I'm learning that I'm still hung up on stupid, dramatic things I said and did when I was in junior high. At this point in my life, it feels like it was attention-seeking and narcissistic... and I guess it really was. But when you are that age, your current experience is all-consuming and it seemed very important at the time - as it does for her, I know.

When she posts something that I don't like, I have hardly ever said anything because I'm so afraid I'll push her away when all I want is for her to know she can count on me. I struggle so much with finding the balance with being a good parent and being someone she feels comfortable reaching out to when she needs support. But how is it possible that you can recognize yourself so much in your child, yet not know what the right thing to say or do is?

Today she posted \*mean\* things on snapchat about the girl who has been her best friend for so many years - a girl my husband and I have come to truly love and cherish as our daughter's best friend. They've gotten in some sort of fight (okay, it's pretty complicated - my daughter is a twin and here we are in junior high and her best friend and twin brother are interested in each other - good god), and I was so sad and disappointed to see that she had posted hateful things about this girl on snapchat. And she's CONSTANTLY posting things like, ""Want to know who I like? hmu I'm bored"" and my eyes are almost falling out of the back of my head, they are rolling so hard. I WOULD HAVE POSTED THE SAME THING if I'd had social media available to me. Aaaargh!

As I said, I try to stay out of it, but I know it's because I feel like conflict and confrontation is pretty much the worst thing ever, and I am so scared for her to feel like she has to hide from me. I know there comes a time when you have to risk that sort of thing in order to be a ""good"" parent, but there's another component to this -

Knowing her as well as I do, I'm so goddamn afraid of her struggling with depression and anxiety and suicidal thoughts all by herself, feeling like she can't come to me or her dad. We've been so incredibly open about mental health, and I truly don't think there is anything more my husband or I could do to make sure all three of our kids know that we understand how serious and valid and real their thoughts, emotions, feelings are.

Anyway, I'm rambling. I do that. Basically -

I'm lost. I know her because I know myself, and I'm trying so hard yet somehow I wonder if that makes it worse. She's loving and respectful - she's never, ever disrespectful, even when I know I've upset her. She just gets quiet and tries very hard to not cry and remain emotionless. But she'll give me a hug after I'm done talking, and she'll say she knows when I ask her if she knows how much I love her and how proud I am of her. How can that be the wrong thing to do? I'm so incredibly lost.",1576129014
ESFJ,"Well my question pretty much speaks for itself but let me try and give a little background.

I have met some men before who have that drill sergeant personality. The hyper-masculine, respect my authority, etc BS.

Now when I first got into MBTI I thought they were people who had dominant Te, but lately with at least one of them I'm wondering if he's actually ESFJ.

While he definitely has all the traits I described above like basically he comes off like he's a drill sergeant, it sort of comes off more like he's Fe-Ti rather than Te-Fi. 

Which got me wondering if this was perhaps a thing.

Would an unhealthy male ESFJ be sort of condition to act more like EXTJ?

I guess the thing that throws me off the most is that he is so confrontational and he's not someone who backs down either. He's that kind of guy who I get the feeling that if I ever did decide to confront him it would probably end in a fist fight, because I don't think  raising my voice and telling him to back off is actually going to do anything.

In other words he's very obsessed with being the alpha male in the room.

Which for healthy ESFJ's that I have met you seem like you're more willing to talk things out rather than just bully people into submission.

Anyway I'm interested in hearing feedback on this.

Please and thank you.",1576016991

You guys are really the most adorable parents ever.

Sadly, unfortunately, I m gay and she's quite religious. When I came out to her, she cried and was genuinely scared for me. She didn't want me to go to hell and she tried her best to manipulate me so that I would ""change my mind""

After 3 months of crying and talking about therapy conversions, I quit my Stoic position, played along and faked being confused about my sexuality then lied to her about dating a girl.

This is probably the first time I ve really lied to her.
2 years later, I m still studying and she thinks I am straight (or at least tries to behave in a way that shows that).

I think that deep inside, she realizes it's not true but doesn't want to see it. (May be wrong though)

ESFJ,"Infp dating esfj- how to understand and connect with esfj?

Hi 

I’m infp dating an esfj for 3years. As infp, I deeply need to connect emotionally and to be able to have deep conversations about everything with the person I’m with. I feel lost without this.

However, I’m feeling this isn’t as important to my esfj ? I’m feeling anxious about this as I do want to understand him better and connect with him in ways that are good for both of us. 

I feel like to him
I’m just rambling on about stuff that’s neither interesting or important to him really and he just zones out with the tv or something leaving me feeling lost and unheard.  Then it goes a bit silent and I panic a bit inside and take refuge in my phone or something. I dated an istj before and I used to be the one who initiated all conversations and I don’t want this to happen again.

I’m struggling anxiety as well and upon reading some more, I think I’m in the loop infp gets in and I’m not sure how to get out of it.

How can I understand my esfj? And connect better in ways that are comfortable for both? I keep feeling like I can’t get it right or I’m saying the wrong thing or something. 

An example, he doesn’t like talking about exes and past experiences. I’ve explained my reason for talking about such things is to understand him better and to learn about what he needs. I get scared he doesn’t want to open up or is hiding something even though he seems a very honest open person so far.  I’m aware I’m stuck in the infp loop about my past relationship as well which isn’t nice for him either. 

Are there any decent books or anything I can read to understand esfj better? How can I connect with you? 

Also such things as they like following a routine in their day, where I’m more go with the flow? I feel like they’re trying to rush through their day with me where I don’t want the day to end. How can I communicate about things like this sensitively? I understand he’s as sensitive as me.

ESFJ,"i have two questions:
1) are esfjs compatible with other esfjs?
2) okay im sorry this is so long - but can someone give me general life advice bout this (if you read it): i am an esfj and i had an esfj friend back in 6th grade. i was the first one to go up to her cuz she seemed really shy at the start of school but we started to hate each other and were possibly using each other and thinking we were more important than the other in what we thought (i think that’s Ti?) so yea.. it got a lil messy. she started gathering friends and taking them away from me while at the same time sending what you call ENTP demons after me, literally saying things about me when i was in the same room and tearing my reputation down - so it wasn’t like i could make new friends quickly when she was taking all of them to her side.... so that destroyed me and i started becoming more and more self conscious and basically insecure, and by the end of two years when i had stuck to her even tho it was unhealthy at that time, i was quiet af and for so long found it hard to go up to people and talk and i thought i was an introvert until like 3 or 4 years later (now) - because when i was acting like an introvert i was really unhappy with being seen as a quiet introvert and felt like my ESFJ -ism was constantly becoming more and more repressed, and start crying myself to sleep because i felt too lonely and hopeless because i was becoming more scared to talk to people and thought i wasn’t important and i wasn’t liked by anyone. i thought i was an isfj but until now i didn’t realise i aligned more with the ESFJ personality especially on C.S. Joseph’s videos (when i took the test on 16personalities.com, i got 80% turbulent on it). i even doubt sometimes my current friends when they say that i’m important to them because i usually don’t understand why they would say that - it took me a while to accept that they were saying that because they are great friends who are caring and loyal (one of them being an amazing esfj and one possibly an infj but not sure) and right now i’m trying to fix myself by trying to re-ESFJ myself because i now feel like i’m really under developed but i don’t exactly know what to do...

soooooo that’s my life story up until now and i am trying to fix right now. i don’t know whether to try to find other esfjs and ask them for their advice and what other people think of me, or even go back to the esfj who set their demons on what she thought (turns out she had confidence issues for some time too....), or go on forums or try to act like everything c.s. joseph says esfjs are when it comes to interacting with other people (which i have spent a long time crying about after being torn apart).",1575240541

ESFJ,"So, I'm spending Turkey Day with my brother and SIL, both of whom are big time ESFJs. I love them both, but usually when we hang out at their place, we just end up watching TV and when I try to elicit conversations with either of them, it peters out quickly and they return to zoning out. It's not like the vibe is uncomfortable or there's a conflict there, more like they are in shut down mode almost. 

I totally don't get this. lol. I thought they were the extroverts here. I don't expect them to be ""on"" all the time or anything, but, man, I could really use some conversation and mental stimulation in these situations. It seems like such a lost opportunity to me and I end up feeling lonely and kind of rejected, though I'm sure that's not their intention.

Also, they usually ask me briefly how I am and then focus on what I've been DOING. It's all about what I'm doing and then what I'm going to do for the next few days. What about what I think and feel about this or that? I mean, there's a lot going on in the world and always a lot to notice, think about, etc. I'm not saying we have to get all emo, or political, or super analytical, but, you know, it would be nice to talk about ideas or the bigger picture once in a while or even something that's more of an insight rather than just...facts.

I hope I'm not being too hard on them or on ESFJs by extension. They are both lovely people and they both have a great sense of humor. I just feel like asking me only about what I'm doing is kind of invalidating and reductive in a way. And I always feel like my reports are not exciting enough for them.

2) I love making music very much. I've played lead guitar in an oldies/pop band, and performed with an Elvis impersonator. I've composed my own album of relaxing/romantic piano music. And even though the background-music (royalty-free music) industry is over-saturated, I still have put out a collection of my own music; this ""Motivation"" track is the best: [https://www.pond5.com/royalty-free-music/item/49105207-motivation-corporate-inspiring-building-beautiful](https://www.pond5.com/royalty-free-music/item/49105207-motivation-corporate-inspiring-building-beautiful)

&amp;#x200B;

3) Three years ago, I got really sick from an autoimmune reaction. My body began attacking it's own liver and tummy. ... I'm working on healing now (avoiding autoimmune reactions), and then also getting back to my ideal weight

&amp;#x200B;

4) Partly because of the high-functioning autism, I'm not very good/comfortable meeting people in real life. And I only started learning about autism, MBTI, and psychology about 4 years ago, which has given me self-awareness that I lacked while growing up. ... For those reasons (and overall anxiety), I haven't really ever dated before. But if I were to date, I wouldn't try to pretend to be some type of ""bad boy tough guy""; I'd allow myself to be the nerdy, quiet, hopeless romantic that I always have been

&amp;#x200B;

5) Partly because of childhood trauma, I tend to doubt myself a lot, and tend to have a difficult time talking/expressing about myself in general. ... Because this is a very vulnerable post, I probably will begin to experience tremendous anxiety about this post being up, about 5-10 days from the time that I post it. ... I used to delete every post that I made on Reddit, within two weeks of posting, because each post made me feel too vulnerable. But I have posts that have been up for months now, I think, so maybe I'm dealing a good job of healing emotionally. :)",1573767547

If she makes something I've never had, and I'm skeptical about it, she will be all; ""Well, how do you know you won't like it if you don't try it?""

But! When I want to try something new for dinner she'll be like; ""No. let's just have something we like because if we end up not liking it, all the food will go to waste.""

I find this to be silly, and start giggling/laughing too much to point out how she's essentially saying that when she wants to try something new it's okay, but when I want to try something new it's not.",1573238521

ESFJ,"My aunt and I have almost a relationship of daughter/mom, she always took care of me, even if she didn't have the obligation to. However, I found a couple things that I'd like to adress with her, for her own well-being

1- I see that she's deeply stressed about her workplace and constantly tries to control people there. But she's deceived and frustrated because nobody puts as much effort as she does in the workplace, and since she works in a hospital, she fears that her co-workers incompetence may cause a life/death situation for patients. 

2- Since she's so frustrated and stressed, she comes home, she finds our house not as clean as she wants to and start yelling at us (my father is an ISTP and works as an electrician, so he has cables, washing machines, and a lot of stuff). Yesterday she asked me to grab the lighter and turn on the oven, so I grabbed the lighter and commented: ""wow, this is hot"". She then started to scream at me saying that I was being whiny and that I never do chores and stuff, then she started connecting things from the past and I honestly felt hurt. We talked it out, and she apologized to me. I have no harsh feelings towards her, but I honestly wish I could do something to make her feel better. 

3- She relies too much on people. We go to a club twice a week, and when we're there she talks and talks with many people, almost half an hour with every person. A few times she told me that these people don't treat her right, that they try to avoid her or that they separate from her once she starts talking about her feelings. And though I understand her, she has friends that treat her well in that same club, so I'm not sure why she holds on so much on people that do not care about her.

ESFJ,"I’ve known this girl for two years now and we’re above average friends, we talk pretty much every day being at college. I just recently got out of a relationship with one of her well ‘friends’ (someone in her corridor around 3-4 weeks ago and was completely fine we are still good friends).

Anyway, I think i’ve always liked this girl and I want to show her that I do like her more than a friend. But i’m concerned as to what she thinks of me? and what she would think of me being more flirtatious all of a sudden. I don’t want to come off as manipulative it’s just very hard for me to gauge whether or not she has feelings for me as well, because she is a generally bubbly and lovely to everyone. 

It’s hard to get her one on one due to living at college and it’s currently exam period so i don’t want to add on any stress to her by dumping my feelings, neither do i want to continue doing nothing because I just can’t ignore my feelings for her! There are currently 3 weeks left as well before we move out for sometime so I don’t want to have done nothing by then!

I give her some of my drawings here and there but I don’t know if that’s enough, we talk a bit online but i’m always concerned i’m being smothering or she doesn’t want to talk. All I really want to do is blurt our that i have feelings for her but all this thinking about the context of it is stopping me, I would love any advice/opinions on anything I could do or if I should just be honest and tell her, or if I should think about it some more and not act so hasty!

ESFJ,"I know an ESFJ woman, and I don't think that she's intentionally mean or anything like that, but there is an issue.

She's kind of a know-it-all, and it's like she has no filter for her mouth.

I will give two examples one of which happened to me personally.

First, A co-worker of mine told her about an idea that they had, and she point blank called the idea stupid.

Second, yesterday I found a bike outside of the building and because she had been there longer than me I asked her if she knew it was out there.

I had no way of knowing if she knew or not. Someone else could have told her, she could have poked her head out there earlier, any number of things could have went down.

But in the most irritated tone she looks at me and goes; ""How, would I know it was out there if I've been in here?""

And as I pointed out above there's a lot of reasons that she could have known it was out there. If she did not know then all she had to do was say to me ""No, I didn't.""

It's sort of like she tries to be a critical thinker, but doesn't really actually think things through before she just blurts out whatever comes into her head.

I don't think she's a bad person you, aside from her bluntness, and inability to apparently think things through before she speaks I don't have any other problems with her.

I'm just not sure how to tell her that her behavior is rubbing people the wrong way because it's gotten to a point of where pretty much everyone hates her behind her back.

What approach would be best?",1572465565

ESFJ,"So I love my ESFJ boyfriend so so much- it’s my first time EVER being with another extrovert. In fact I’ve only ever been with ISFJs so this type is very new to me. But he is such an incredible man and I’m head over heels!

SO...Christmas is coming up! It will be our first Christmas but just for context, we aren’t “public” yet. In the sense that we both have children and are both divorced, we are going slow as far as the kids go. I mean our kids all know we talk and are clearly “close”. We have a solid relationship but really want to do this right by the children. Not sure if that context helps but I thought I’d throw it in. 

His birthday was in August and I got him this gorgeous suit jacket that I noticed he’d been eying a few weeks prior, and a bottle of his favorite cologne as he was running out. I know ESFJs like “finer things” haha so that’s where my current dilemma comes in. 

I don’t have a lot of money this year, which he knows (and is always great about- he pays for things and always asks if I need anything). So I can’t get him more than one nice gift. I’ve narrowed down the options to this (but am also open to suggestions)

-a super nice, expensive watch. He has several watches and a couple months ago was eyeing another one. I know he likes nice things so maybe it would be special if he sees that I pay attention and get him something nice. I found a beautiful and unique watch that I think he’d absolutely love. 

-or, the sentimental route-

-there is this website that sells gorgeous constellation maps from a particular day and time and location. So basically you plug in a significant location and date and time, and it calculates the exact star constellations that were overhead that exact place and time and makes a gorgeous print of it- large and in a frame so it looks very chic and decorative. I was gonna do the day that we officially “began” our relationship and realized we both had feelings. The caption says “our worlds collide” above the constellation map. It doesn’t have any other words on it so it just looks like a piece of art but we would both know the meaning. This is what it looks like tho I would do the black version bc it’s more sleek:

ESFJ,"Well, hello, I'm nearly 18 years old and there are a lot of thing which are questionable about my ESFJ mom's logic and I'd like to know ESFJ parents' perspective on that;

1. How hard is it for you to explain logically why I should behave this or that way? Literally her reasoning is ""You are my son and you are supposed to obey me"". I try to question it and explain that just because she's my mom, doesn't mean she's always right - I am a bad child. I just need a logical reason why X is better than Y;

2. Do you all just worry 24/7 what others might think? Being nearly obsessed with worrying about being viewed in a bad way annoys me till this day. I am gay and I came out to her some months ago, literally the first thing she thought was worrying what will other people in the town think about this and I destroyed her dreams of traditional family (this is going to be my next question);

3. Why are you so tied to what was in the past? Just because something existed back then, doesn't mean it's good or there aren't better examples. Just an stupid example - she gets mad when I experiment with flavours of crisps or just can't take a risk of trying new pizza. There's always a possibility that can be improved, changed;

4. Is it hard for you to understand others' opinions and tastes? For example, my mom hates tattoos, piercing, colorful hair etc. and she just has to make a remark to me when she sees someone who has either of those. I try to explain to her that it's their body, their choice, their preference, but she just doesn't get it. Even simple disagreeing with her makes her mad because she only understands her opinion;

I'd love to know your perspective on those topics so I can understand my mom better, because outside of mom-son relationship we get on really well and I don't want to be forced to lose touch with her when I move out. Thanks for reading",1572133754
ESFJ,"Warning- this might be long.

I have? had? an ISFP friend for several years. To spare you with details, some stuff happened between us of which she became extremely hurt by some actions of mine.

Her initial pain is understandable, but I explained to her my perspective of why I did what I did. I told her it was a misunderstanding and I never meant to hurt her. Her response continued to be that still, i handled things very poorly. 

Fair enough. Even then, I'm someone who tries to focus on intent rather than the action itself. The way i see it, essentially she had certain expectations of me as a close friend that I didn't live up to. 

Anyways, I thought that she had forgiven me but it seems she just doesn't want to talk as this is her ""new normal"". I have no clue what that means, and whether the friendship is over or not, but im going to assume the worst. My father, an ENTP, also thinks she should be more forgiving of me. 

Quite frankly, I have a lot of anger in this situation. I've recalled that she's hurt me several times in the past, and I've just gotten over it or forgiven her because I would be throwing away our history of friendship. I've always been a doormat in many relationships just because I fear abandonment. And look what happened; my worst nightmare. 

On the flip side, she can just cut me out of her life without any qualms. 

It's made me resentful of being a Fe-Si user and seeing Fi users so easily enforce boundaries in spite of any outside information. I've been in tremendous emotional pain over this situation, and that doesn't factor in with her at all. 

I really feel like I am not built to just move on from someone, and not be fearful of forming new friendships with other people. I also feel afraid of dealing with anything that reminds me of her, e.g. pictures or other items. I have no clue what cognitive tools exist for an ESFJ to do this.

ESFJ,"I felt like telling you all some amazing things I see about you, from INFP perspective, this morning. I know sensors sometimes get some hate in the MBTI community, but that's just because people get attached to negative stereotypes or their memory of that one person they met who was difficult that one time. 

I have the pleasure of knowing a few ESFJs in my office, and have some general praise. Obviously, this is based only on my knowledge of them but all three share the same awesome characteristics:

1) **Enthusiasm. Enthusiasm for days.** \- I have never met people so consistently pumped up to be alive in my life. They pump up everyone around them, too, but not in an annoying way like some people might try to fake. In a genuine way that you can tell is just them being them. They're just excited at the prospect of making everyone else excited and happy, which is so special. You shouldn't discount that about yourself. It is truly a gift. 

2) **Other types talk a big game about empathy. You all have it 100% in real time.** \- While I'm growing to love my FI function for what it is, I truly admire high FE for being there in the thick of things with empathetic reaction. People talk about empathetic perception in INFJs and ENFJs, but they don't acknowledge how real it is in ESFJs/ISFJs too. If anything, I think its more real because its more in-the-moment and based on current information rather than theories. I've begun to notice how quickly one of my coworkers in particular can turn around my terrible day. JUST by being perceptive of where I am. That's so appreciated in a job that's been difficult for me, you have no idea. 

3) **ESFJs don't quit when the going gets tough. I think they have almost unparalleled loyalty to people IN SPITE of being hurt or other people being bad to them. They have admirable emotional resilience** \- This may just be for the ESFJs I know, but I notice they almost do this to a fault. You could be just awful to them and they won't give up on trying to brighten your day or make you smile. I think INFPS and ISFPs can let themselves get bogged down in the disappointment of being hurt by others. ESFJs seem to be so much better at brushing off the pains of life and maintaining a sunny attitude. 

4) **They're better at creating a nice ambiance and fashion than me.** \- Lol, I'm just always going to appreciate this in other types. I'm horribly backwards at fashion and half the time I wouldn't notice bullet holes in the office walls if they showed up one day. 

5) **I know this is a stereotype, but they really do seem to have a knack for being gracious hosts.** \- My coworker worked two jobs, had kids, and STILL found the time to make cupcakes for people's birthdays in the office. The two ESFJs immediately remembered when my birthday was, even though I'd mentioned it maybe one time the previous year. I'm really quiet in the office, so that was special to me. 

6) **You're still participating in the mbti community in spite of all of the ridiculous stereotypes about sensors.** Lol, its true. I can't blame sensors for not being as into MBTI. I think people are started to notice the sensor hate trend and are turning it around, though.",1571841022

ESFJ,"So I love my ESFJ boyfriend but I keep coming across this problem and I’m trying to understand how you guys think and operate but I can’t get the hang of it!!

A very simple issue arose last night. My boyfriend and I had a brief phone call last night- I messaged him that I really missed him cause we barely got to talk all day and I wanted to end the night talking to him. He calls me but we got interrupted and he had to abruptly get off the phone (he had his daughter that night - I totally understand and support him putting her first). But then he never called me back or even messaged me. So I went to bed upset cause our last interaction wasn’t the greatest. All I needed was a messages saying something to the effect of “hey, sorry we got cut off, I love you and I’ll call you in the morning!”

I’ve told him a bunch of times I need just a little message like that cause I hate to end on what I feel is a bad note. So he calls me on his way to work this morning and I veryyyy casually mention that I wished he would’ve messaged me. I know enough not to directly confront and issue with an ESFJ lol. So I made it about me- I said “it makes me sad when we don’t end well, I just need a little message and then I’m all good. I completely understand your daughter needed you and I support that. Just pls send me a text after.”

Didn’t work lol. Got the usual ESFJ response where he defended himself and got super quiet. He did apologize but it was followed with “I need to put my daughter first, I called you this morning didn’t I?” Etc. then he was super quiet the rest of the call. 

Help me out here please! Why did he get so quiet but more importantly what do I do next? Should I message him and smooth it over or wait until we talk again? Do I address this or just wait until he normalizes? I HATE unresolved tension so this is hard for me.",1571658691

He was also very undecided on what he wants to do if he goes back to school. He also feels like he’s holding me back cause I’m doing ok at school and I told him I’d help him the best I can and I’d go to classes with him so we could study together, and that I shouldn’t be helping him.

My boyfriend is amazing. He’s an ESFJ and I love him very much. BUT...I can’t ever seem to resolve issues I have. For example- (and this is a small example) he said he would do something with me one day. We planned it in advance and I was really looking forward to it. He ended up getting super busy and decided to work Uber for a while and just got caught up and when he finally got in touch with me, he was too tired. 
Not a huge deal- but I was upset and when I brought it up it turned into a “I’m a horrible boyfriend” “I can’t do anything right” and then progressed to defensive “well I was working and for really busy, cut me some slack!”

This is how it always goes when I have a problem to address. I try and follow the advice I’ve gotten and I do it in a calm way, always reaffirm his good traits, and generally do it nicely and put it more on me (saying I FEEL a certain way when you do this etc). But it goes down the same no matter what lol. He will usually apologize later on but I wonder if it’s just to appease things or if he’s really hearing me. 

Thoughts?

Also...since I have your ears haha...sometimes I feel he isn’t loyal to me bc of his desire to be liked by everyone. I don’t mean unfaithful...there was a mutual friend of ours who told him an outright lie about me.

ESFJ,"Ni dominant, Fe auxiliary here.

I suck at school and completing the homework. I have a few As and Cs, recently having been getting higher grades because of the less-rigorous course switch. Rarely do I apply myself to actually taking time to do homework, I just don’t see the point in it and I think it’s irrelevant to truly learning (beyond the material). 

Sometimes I think the methods presently used by formal education institutions are a complete waste of time, although I understand they’re necessary to pursue higher education, receive better income, maintain regular stimulating brain-activity, and to build social circles. I just don’t like the way it is, and I have a lot of difficultly accepting the “system,” and frequently ‘rebel’ against it to prove the point that it can be irrelevant and the activities are fruitless and wasteful of students; However, I am grateful to have the resources to attend the institution, I just feel very conflicted.

ESFJ,"This is kind of a doozy but I appreciate any advice any ESFJs can give. 

My husband’s mom is an esfj (I’m an INTP female). We are normal functioning adults and get along well, very loving family all around. She is very very concerned all the time about being in the way, being intrusive, bothering me/us. Every time she calls or texts to ask a question she apologizes for bothering. She’s obviously very afraid of...something. Not being wanted? She’s soo over apologetic and appears to be extremely sensitive. Now my INTPness is obviously exhausted by this but I’m emotionally developed enough to handle it thank you very much. BUT we are welcoming our first baby soon, and a few weeks later MIL is staying with us for 2 weeks. She’s already super concerned about being in the way and making a big deal about it making sure it’s ok. Her trying to be very considerate ends up making everything about her. This is where I need help. I do EVERYTHING I can to make her feel welcome and loved and it never seems to be quite enough. I’m worried that with a new baby and postpartum emotions and exhaustion I’ll snap. Because me worrying about her worrying about being in the way is sooo much more annoying than anything else. I need her to chill and stop worrying about this. Because I will be too exhausted to worry about it for her. I want to tell her it drives me crazy and if she’s “in the way” I will tell her but stop worrying and talking about it.
**Do I have this conversation with her upfront? As soon as they get here? Or do I have no hope of altering this life long habit of hers without causing a bigger problem?

I know obvious healthy relationship 101 and I've asked them before but they they both don't enjoy being put on the spot because they need space/time to articulate their strong feelings, and then later they forget why or don't want to be bothered.

We also tend to have communication issues alot and i am not sure why. Is this because we are both sensitive personalities? Could it have been the fault of texting which leads to unclear miscommunication?

I am left wondering why.....i felt like i have put in all my effort. I wonder why didnt it work out.... Ended up he became resentful and seeks to get even? Although we both agreed that we never actually meant to hurt each other.....why do i feel like he is manipulated my feelings.

I'm farely sure my dominant function is extraverted feeling because I feel like I'll drop dead if I upset anyone.

ESFJ,"Hi everyone! I'm an ENTP female. I met this guy last weekend, and we went out one afternoon this past week. 

To me, he seems very insecure on a number of levels. Emotionally, about his personality, and about his relationships with other people. Like he told me about an occasion recently when a friend of his, who is going through some significant struggles, pretty much ghosted him. He was extremely upset about it. He clearly took this to heart, like he had somehow done something wrong. To me, it sounded like she was having a hard time and needed space. Not a big deal to me. Even if it was something about him, I think sometimes people change their minds about others and fade away, and even deliberately cut others out. It's a part of life. A part that sucks, but it happens and you move on. This happened early this year, and he's still distraught. I was sympathetic, and I do feel bad for him. But my question is- is this typical of ESFJs? This type of visceral, emotional reaction? Is this specific to the situation? Or is he an emotionally immature example?

That's one example. He would also just laugh at things that I said that weren't even that funny. I know I'm an ENTP and I have a humor streak for sure, but not like that. It seemed like a nervous laughter thing, like he was trying to fill the space or make sure I felt validated somehow. At various points he kept asking me if I was comfortable with him. I had to tell him ""If I wasn't comfortable enough with you, I wouldn't be here with you at all."" 

So are these things permanent traits? Or is this him trying to get comfortable with me and will they fade away if we get to know each other better?",1567319240

This is an ENFJ explaining inferior Ti. She discusses ESFJ towards the end.

What she says is true: ""Esfjs have difficult deciding what is their opinion and what is the public opinion"". However, she also says that this is the reason we don't ""self critical"", ""feel guilty about everything"", ""insecure"", and ""not good enough"" unlike ENFJs with their Ni-Ti. 

I am confused by the connection. Would insecurity stem from comparing yourself to others, i.e. being swayed by another's opinion?

Unless she's talking about EXFJs getting praise by the public or a part of some group. So Esfjs would just take other people's views as the truth and leave it at that; ENFJs on the flip side would focus more on their self perception rather than the public's.  

I was confused by her explanation because I, myself, could directly relate to what she said about the ENFJs inferior Ti, though I'm an ESFJ. So I wanted to see if I was missing something.",1567288447
ESFJ,"My wonderful boyfriend is an ESFJ and he’s amazing...except he continuously talks about his ex-wife. Granted, he is fresh out of a divorce after an 11 year marriage - that’s actually how we met. We were friends and I stood by his side as he went through it. Then it became more. He is extremely vocal about his love for me and his desire to have a future with me and he always says how thankful he is that he has me. 

But, it hurts me when he talks about how hurt he is over her. Please be kind- I know he’s hurting and I know it was a long marriage and I don’t expect him to just “be ok”. She left him- abruptly and without much reason that he can understand. So it was pretty much the worse thing that can happen to an ESFJ. 

I know you all process things by talking about it all the time. I guess what I’m asking is this- can he really be in love with me if he is still hurt over that? When he talks about how cold she is to him when they have to interact for their daughter, is that just his hurt or is it lingering feelings for her? I just wanna understand. Thank you.",1566701328

ESFJ,"&amp;#x200B;

I don't think I'm crazy to see a difference here. 

This is the INTj (INTP in socionics) description about some of their weaknesses. Let's start with Si:

\&gt;LIIs are not naturally very adept at understanding their internal physical needs and may generally neglect them, **seeing them as not really worth their time...They tend to appreciate individuals** who naturally direct themselves towards attending to the needs of others by force of habit and without explicit direction.

\&gt;LIIs can **underemphasize** the importance of physical well-being and comfort on their overall mental health and functioning.

This, to me, seems more like a hand-waving of LII's poor skills in a certain areas. ""Oh, it's only because they're just \*not interested\* in that subject and because they're insecure. That's why they are not very good"". 

Even here for their poor Fe:

\&gt;LIIs may be highly sensitive to the signs of emotional approval that they receive from others. **They may be highly appreciative of displays of emotional warmth and friendliness.** 

\&gt;LIIs may be quite susceptible to acting in accordance to the mood of others, and may **undervalue** the importance of avoiding argumentation on their mental well-being.

Again the hand-waving. Overall, the descriptions sound very positive for these guys. 

Let's look at ESFJ, shall we?

\&gt;ESEs **may have difficulty following logical connections or understanding**, ***and*** may consider themselves naturally unsuited towards evaluating abstract, philosophical reasoning. However, they may have a fascination of sorts in hearing about epistemic viewpoints, new ideas, and advancements in human understanding. They may be particularly interested in philosophy, enjoying it for the clarity and universality of its conclusions.

How about Ne?

\&gt;ESEs **may have difficulty coming up with new or innovative ideas, evaluating the potential of certain ideas, or engaging in conceptual juxtaposition or lateral thinking.** Nonetheless, they are sometimes be seen as somewhat more bright and imaginative, energetic, and fantasy-oriented than LSEs

There's no ""this ain't worth my time. I can do it if I put time and effort, but eh"", or ""it's only because they're too damn insecure in this department; if only they'd work on that"". This is ""ESFJs are poor at doing this and they know it. Point blank.""",1566228599
ESFJ,"I am an ENFJ and my new boyfriend is an ESFJ. I was married for 15 years to an ISFJ and have dated other introverts and honestly being worth my ESFJ boyfriend is soooo refreshing. I got so tired of doing all the work in my relationships and having to always pry love from my men. My boyfriend makes me feel loved every day. He is amazing. 

But...and I don’t know how to word this...sometimes I feel there is a “disconnect” between his actions and his heart. This is hard to explain- he says amazing things to me all the time, is very affectionate, asks me how I’m doing...but there’s a part of me that feels it doesn’t go deep enough. Like if I say I don’t feel well he will genuinely say “awe babe I’m so sorry” but then I feel it’s forgotten in a millisecond never to be brought up again. Or he will not think to ask about a recurring stressful situation im in. I really don’t know how to explain this bc he’s so good at verbal affirmations and physical affection, but sometimes I feel it isn’t connecting.

After nearly a decade of marriage, she's seeing it too now. He's started treating her the way he treats me, and well everyone else. She's afraid of him. She's flat out admitted it, but she won't fight back, or call him on his shit. He's too ""dominating"" to argue against, due to his incredible temper, and inability to accept that he could be wrong.

This post is not meant to belittle, insult, or attack, but I have a question born out of anger. 

My mom is an ESFJ. For the most part she's a good woman, but she has this massively annoying habit of starting up completely idiotic arguments with me. 

Tonight for example I don't like being stared at when I eat, so I got a little huffy at the dog for begging me for food. It wasn't the dog, I was mad at. I was upset because I had two slices of pizza I was going to just toss in the garbage, because I know if I bagged them for later I would never eat them. I just don't do left overs, and my folks can't/won't have pepperoni. Well now I can't just quietly toss it in the trash, because if I do my folks will notice, cause the dog is there.

My mom thinks I'm upset simply at the dog for begging, and gets up on this moral high horse, to tell me how wrong I am for being upset. 

I remember one time I got pissed over my sister's Ex taking food off my plate to the point of where I put my plate on my lap to make sure he didn't pull that again. On the drive home my mom told me all about how I better never act like that again, and my behavior was unacceptable, and yada yada.

Also if I yell back she cries. I remember one time I had enough. I was just at my limit, and went off on her, and my sister later on calls me to say about how she's been crying so hard all day, cause I yelled at her. 

On most days I'm not even argumentative. I usually don't back talk, I had just hit a limit on that particular day.

Your ESFJ has a natural radar for what you need and for the collective mood of a certain place. This also means your ESFJ use their knowledge of feelings to their advantage for better or worse.

2. Si

Your ESFJ uses Si to store subtle tidbits of information that no one else remembers such as your favorite food and when you last did X. ESFJ may forgive, but ESFJ never forgets.

3. Ne

This is how your ESFJ comes up with 1,001 ways to please you that they never act on. They may change up what they know in their Si in order to experiment with the different outcomes that result.

4. Ti

ESFJs don’t like their Ti and for a good reason. Ti is an over-analytical downward spiral into anxiety and depression. In this mode, your ESFJ should use the distress signal, but they never realize it when in Ti overload.

Modus Operandi:

Caring Friend: This is your ESFJ’s default state. They will make you a ton of your favorite food to share and wrap you in fuzzy blankets at convenient times.

Mentor: When you give an ESFJ an interest pack that you lack skill in, they will teach you.   


Passive Aggressive: This mode is activated when you anger your ESFJ. Confront with logic in order to shut down this mode.

Warrior: This mode comes out when people hurt you. ESFJs are protective of those they love and will defend you relentlessly.

Downhill Spiral: \*Locked\* Technically a mode, but detrimental to your ESFJ. Teach your ESFJ to control their Ti to prevent this.   


Sustenance  


Your ESFJ needs nutritive matter in their preferred form and plenty of affection in order to function properly. ESFJs will often set their needs aside for you, so make sure your ESFJ does not overexert themselves caring for you. Do not mess up the ESFJ’s clothing with food stains.   


Grooming

ESFJs take pride in all aspects of their appearance. Your ESFJ will tend to over-dress, but not in ways that look blatantly out of place. Don’t be surprised if your ESFJ keeps adjusting their clothes or hair if nothing looks wrong to you. ESFJs hold themselves to very high, quixotic even, standards in regards to this area.

Sleeping Habits

ESFJs will usually sleep a good 8-9 hours a night unless kept up by real or perceived social demands. They like being surrounded by pillows and/or stuffed animals when they sleep and will often drink warm milk and/or read a book before sleeping. Your ESFJ might wake you up in the middle of the night if they had a nightmare or got sick, but not for much else.

FAQ

My ESFJ is angry/sad/visibly distressed. What should I do?

Wrap your ESFJ tightly with one or both of the enclosed fluffy blankets. Feed them their favorite food and play their favorite movie. Hug your ESFJ and thank them for taking care of you. Repeat until ESFJ is satisfied.

My ESFJ is screaming over nothing?

ESFJs are emotional creatures. Screaming over nothing is a sign of an overlooked physical or emotional need. Remember that the ESFJ needs at least ten (10) square servings of affection a day to stay healthy. Also make sure that this isn’t the result of a medical need or a neurological disorder.

My ESFJ is rejecting my friend packs?

The ESFJ will not make friends that aren’t friends with their friends and is conscious of their image. The Rationals Friend Pack gets rejected the most often, but many ESFJs successfully accept the Rationals Friend Pack after a lot of persistence and delicious food.

The emotional probe kit broke?

This happens with overuse. Get a replacement ASAP to prevent downhill spiral mode.

ESFJ,"So [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/9y42p4/i_still_cant_understand_why_ti_and_fi_are/e9zj2mf?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) post says the following about Fi:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Ti and Fi operate the same way, meaning that they both analyze and process things internally. They differ when it comes to what they value-&gt; Fi ""MY wants, MY morals, what I feel is right"" whereas Ti is: ""MY understandings, MY logic, what I think is right"". And based on what they value is how they come to decisions on what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

So by that logic, wouldn't Fe and Te be ""similar"" just that one focuses on external values and one focuses on facts?

&amp;#x200B;

So Fi and Ti **analyze** while Fe and Te **strategize**.

ESFJ,"No matter how in tune I am with others’ emotions, I can’t help but feel hesitant to express my own. I avoid conflict the best I can, but when I don’t agree with someone / feel differently than they do, naturally differences arise that should be addressed to maintain a healthy relationship. 

Have any fellow ESFJ’s found a good way to express yourselves? What helped you feel more comfortable to do so? I want advocate for myself, but also want to be respectful of others.",1561957752

ESFJ,"Hey there!  I am trying to better understand and relate to ESFJs. 

&amp;#x200B;

here are the questions:

&amp;#x200B;

What is the experience of receiving affirmation like for you? 

&amp;#x200B;

What is the experience of receiving criticism like for you? 

&amp;#x200B;

Being that you show a lot of empathy and care for others, a seeming contradiction is how your type is quick to dish out the same type of criticism that you hate.  Can you explain to me why that is?  

&amp;#x200B;

People of your type are known for developing strong conclusions/judgments about people, can you help explain what motivates that?

&amp;#x200B;

People of your type are known for not easily changing your minds when you have settled on a judgment/conclusion about someone.  Do you ever feel you could be wrong about your judgments?  Have you ever been in a situation where something contradicted a judgement you held, how did you reconcile that?",1561827201
ESFJ,"Hi guys!

I'm dropping by to let you all know that a friend of mine has started an ESFJ server for you all to enjoy, if you so choose. It's small, but I'd love to see it start thriving! Hopefully many of you will drop in to see what it's all about at least.

Hope to see you there! https://discord.gg/qGfXGmb",1561814643

He’s the “my way or the highway” kind of ESFJ and claimed himself to be a logical person. Any chance of us being friends again?",1561806486

ESFJ,"I'm an ESFJ female married to an INTJ male. I know right? Lol. We met very young (17 &amp;19) and have been together 12 years.We have a great relationship. Where he lacks I make up for and vice versa. I have given him more of a ""moral compass"" and more of a ""social awareness"" because he can come off as being very intense without even knowing it. He has helped me think outside of the box and make logical decisions rather than emotional ones.. Yes it's true ESFJs are people pleasers and can tend to be spread thin and put themselves last. He definitely made me comfortable with saying the word NO lol sinply put. I've read that many INTJs are cold but I don't ever get that side of him. He's very caring, nurturing and attentive. With INTJs you really have to tell then exactly how you feel because they simply wont read between the lines lol we learned that the hard way in our very early years... So he's made me a much better communicator. We are great together..truly ying and yang but it WORKS! He makes me feel brave and helps me think outside the box..I'm a traditionalist by nature so thinking outside the box isn't something I practiced. I am constantly learning from him. His thirst for knowledge is so attractive to me. According to everything I read about our personality tyoes we are the worst match possible but here we are madly inlove with 2 children. 💝

What are your experiences with INTJ?",1560300553
ESFJ,"Okay so. I get it- this is a weird claim. INTJs are practically our antithesis. And yet... I find them growing on me over time. No clue why.

On the flip side, most INTPs seem to rub me the wrong way. Granted, they can be reeeallyy cool if mature, but those folks aren't very common in my circle. 

It's a strange phenomenon and I don't understand my feelz.",1560210094
