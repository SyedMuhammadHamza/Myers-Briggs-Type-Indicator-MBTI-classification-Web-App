ESFP,‚ÄúLosing awareness‚Äù because of daydreaming def isn‚Äôt Se my guy. Sounds like intuition to me.,1617466045
ESFP,"It isn't. I think people get open-minded confused with not making a decision as opposed to being able to change it when the situation requires it. Both Se-doms are rather decisive. How else would we be able to thrive in the moment, wing it, and do great in an ongoing crisis? It's the lack of hesitation that serves us well.",1617463295
ESFP,"I'd say Se egos are very decisive. You can judge us for what we're decisive based on, but we're definitely people of action and quick decisions when needed. We are able to change our minds, but if you consider that a real decision is always an action, until then it's just a mental exercise, then I'd say we are very decisive, just open-minded to adaptation.

Does this feel like you?

Otherwise, from what you described I'd say pretty much all of it together would hint at not an Se-user. Could be ESFJ or ENFP maybe? Or something other yet.

Not all ESFPs are extremely dexterous, or graceful, but they are physically aware and present.",1617462766

Yeah, that's probably a good way to go about it. I like Personality Database, but at times, it can be quite inaccurate. However, going with very one sided votes is probably a relatively safe bet.",1617406365

ESFP,"Honestly, the strengths are their own weakness. With Se I have very good hearing, vision, probably taste and smell too, but these senses can become overwhelming and make it hard to focus in everyday scenarios. 

For example, being out in public and being constantly bombarded by sensory information, I might get forcibly distracted and have difficulty regaining control of my awareness. Practicing maintaining my focus has been a long and hard effort (I could also be more sensitive than other esfps, not sure).

About Ni, I don‚Äôt think I can consciously use this at all. I know I have trouble handling and conceptualizing abstract ideas and that I am very aloof, always late, and I have no clearly defined goals in life - but I‚Äôm more or less accomplished so I don‚Äôt care lol (recent grad, decent job). I have been surrounding myself with some intuitive types hoping that they‚Äôll rub off on me... but idk if it‚Äôs working - I usually zone out when they get all abstracty.",1617392040

Even if there's not a romantic connection, it's nice to know that he enjoys being around me... Maybe that alone means more to me than just some standard superficial flirting...  
I also don't really fall for people based on what their mbti type are (I've already liked an ENFJ, ENTJ, ENFP, ENTP...) I definitely fall for extraversion but I just haven't really fallen for a sensor before and I just want to understand a bit more about how he functions because like I said, to me he's difficult to read... If I know anything, it's the fact that you ESFPs are very attractive when you're vibing",1617337177
ESFP,"hate infps, mostly attracted to thinkers",1617333898
ESFP,"I can‚Äôt provide you with a full answer, but here‚Äôs what I‚Äôll say about myself as an esfp- it doesn‚Äôt matter who you are, I will be friendly, I‚Äôll be a bit loud, and I‚Äôll be true to myself at all times. 

HOWEVER. As time goes on, I won‚Äôt be trying to get to know just anyone. If he is still asking you questions after a few weeks (you said 1.5 weeks?), he‚Äôs at least intrigued by you, whatever ‚Äúthat‚Äù means. For me, could be either romantic or that you give good vibes and I like the company. Can‚Äôt speak for him, as I‚Äôm not him. But at the very least you know he is certainly aware of you. The ‚Äújust like this around everyone‚Äù line is not true for me, personally. I‚Äôm always nice, but I‚Äôm not always playful. That is reserved for the people I enjoy. And if I have a crush? I might get more distant and awkward 

This person sounds very likely to be an esfp based on your description. 

Good luck. Crushes/infatuations can be brutal. Hope it works out for you!

people who have adhd are also considered talkative and are into performing once again esfps traits as this type is literally called the entertainer/ performer

ESFP,"The prerogative of ESFP is that they perceive in the here and now, tangible stuff, transient opportunities. Many lack patience in learning theory without the opportunity to apply it asap. They're 100% wired to act. 5s lack confidence in their ability to affect the world tangibly, so they escape to collect endless knowledge in order to feel safe.

You tell me how this would be irl. Most confident in affecting the world here and now vs least confident in affecting the world here and now. Escaping from knowledge with no application vs finding security in collecting knowledge and not applying it.

So, it's like having a red circle but it's a blue square. This is why I said it's very unlikely. More likely, even though 8 is not the most common type in ESFPs, is to have an ESFP 8 that is depressed through failing to affect the world in ways it desires, hence falling into deep depression and nihilism. 8s disintegrate into 5. I can imagine an incredibly unhealthy, depressed, and resigned on the world ESFP 8 looking like a 5.",1616879779

ESFP,I‚Äôve experience this. Depends on the guy. This one guy certain things he was afraid to try and eventually I ended it because I was never sexually satisfied . I mean I did give it a try for a year but it really depends on their attitude and excitement in the matter. I had been with someone else inexperience but he was excited to try and do new things so it made it just as fun .,1615947979

ESFP,"Yeah or maybe ISFP or ENFP

The big difference from ESFP and ENFP is that ENFPs are more into philosophy and less concerned with style. A lot of ENFPs I know are Ambiverts.

ISFPs are more introverted than ESFPs",1615929075

ESFP,"My fave! My ex of 10 years was an INFJ and let me tell you, loving him was TOUGH, at first. The two main issues we had was the fe Fi dichotomy and how we process the world. If i was happy, our relationship was great. If i was not, we were not. We also would frequently argue about my ""associates"" as he called them because INFJ are a pretty accurate judge of human character and i thought he was being too hasty ""throwing the whole person away."" To his credit, only 2 people ever proved me right hahaha  Te and ti and our respective savior functions being the others aspirational/inferior functions are where we really bonded. I wanted to learn all the things he wanted to teach me, i lauded his planning capabilities and he was just in awe at how much fun i can have with literally anything (seriously, us ESFPs are like mcguyver with fun). It's definitely a doable thing so long as you both give each other a WIDE berth to be radically different from each other (i.e. radical acceptance).",1615859679
ESFP,"WHEEEEWWWW SIS! lemme tell you, that man is toxic. You need to run, don't walk, away from him! As for your shallow ""friend"" sounds like she hasn't matured enough to take constructive criticism, which is common for ESFPs unfortunately 

What i can tell you is he sounds stuck in a Se Te loop. For example: whenever he has made up his mind that he's going to have sex with you that evening (it sounds rapey i know....}. That's a singular future goal that is self serving (i want to get off. Hi there Se) and because you have history (don't have to learn a whole new person's body and how we have sex together. efficient! Te, happy). Now, if he was MATURE he would sit with his morals (Fi) for a minute and realize that this approach isnt likely to make him feel good about himself later on because it's informed by healthy appreciation of at least one of the long term consequences (concerns for both of your well being, COVID-19, sti, pregnancy, etc.)

 I know my ni usually will single out one long term consequence and that's usually enough for me to refrain from a presently enjoyable experience. It's kinda like my conscience. For example, yesterday, bc dst, i was DYING at 10 pm. I was going to just go to sleep; however, my bf and i have a nightly ritual where we talk before bed between 11 and 12 when we both normally are winding down. Now, Se only cares about sleep. Te says ""you're already in the bed"" however, ni says ""not calling him will ruin his evening and tomorrow he will have an attitude."" And Fi says ""i don't like how i feel when he's mad/annoyed/etc. at me."" so, called him and told him i was going to sleep. drama avoided. It's not far out like ni dominants, but i am getting better at predicting what bad thing is going to happen tomorrow with some regularity and do stuff so it doesn't happen. 

Wishing you the best on your degree and much success leaving this guy behind!!",1615859090

ESFP,"I'm not cokakukla1, but I am an ESFP, so to your question, yes. I'd absolutely respect being upfront about it without beating around the bush a lot more than the wishy washy scared alternatives. If someone is to have a shot, being direct without beating around the bush is their best shot. Hell, even if I turn them down, I'll respect them for the directness and be flattered. And it's happened to me before that someone being direct, and then respectful and taking it like a champ if I turn them down, made me change my mind and ask them out later.",1615850969
ESFP,"Making a move is really the only way to find out, and we generally appreciate unabashed directness, not this ploy kind of going around it trying to gauge interest and trick into going out. So, your plan to come clean is the best one! One way or another, you'll know ;)",1615850764
ESFP,"Its clear you're massively overthinking this, so here's my advice 

I'm not your crush so I don't know what they find attractive. Just be open, be direct, make things fun and laid back, just shoot your shot

Don't think about it too much, just do it",1615850751
ESFP,"If they're actually interested, not just being nice, then yes. If it's just being nice and seeing there's an opening, I don't walk into doors just because they're unlocked either. There must be something in it for me that makes it worth it.",1615850662
ESFP,"I have a habit of flirting indiscriminately for fun and then about 60% of it will evolve into real feelings as I go. If I'm in a room full of people I like, I'm probably romantically interested in over half of them. This is something I'm trying to be more mindful of just because I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings. I realize not everyone operates this way.

Anyway it'd probably be best to just be upfront with them. The less confusion the better, I think.",1615850473
ESFP,"Oh, it's definitely different! Casual flirting is generic, it's just being nice with an accent. When it's meant for a purpose, it's a lot more personal, specific, and likely physical. When I flirt with you with an intent, *you know!*",1615850458
ESFP,"I‚Äôm not one to lecture anybody on what to do. But if I can support them somehow, I absolutely will do that.  TOTALLY depends on what the bad behavior is and how much it impacts my Fi.",1615849361

I blocked him. :)",1615843898
ESFP,"I know an INFJ mam or so I suspect who is deeply in love with me or so he says lol.

I would say that he is yet to convince me or prove to me that he can make me happy.

However, I do like his patience and his dedication.",1615842926
ESFP,"I can help you understand ESFPs- don‚Äôt use these bad experiences with these jerks form your opinions or definitions of who we are. I agree with the others to distance yourself from them. Learn about the non-negative-stereotype ESFPs, as these ESFPs are the embodiment of the unhealthy version rather than your more typical positive and ‚Äúlive and let live‚Äù version of us. 

I‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôve had these experiences! :(",1615841954
ESFP,"This is a complicated subject, because intention has everything to do with whether I would consider it flirting or not.  The problem is, I find that I just naturally vibe more with females, and my style of communication can be pretty flirty and full of banter. I find it more comfortable than with other guys to talk that way. To be honest, whenever I had feelings for somebody, I found that I would actually shut down more rather than getting more flirty. If I saw that that person also had interest, ***that*** is when I would get even more flirty/bantery than normal. But if it was totally unknown? I would shut down more.

Point being, if she has anything like I am, an increase in flirting could mean that she knows you like her as well. That is how it was for me (I‚Äôm married now and have been for a long time). I don‚Äôt want to mislead you though, as not all people are the same.",1615841366

ESFP,"I‚Äôm an INFJ, and married to an ESFP for 3 years now. It is tough, but doable. My partner grew up in a conservative household and with great values, so that helps me out so much, but our way of thinking is not the same, I am very optimistic and conscious, while my partner is not, I love to progress and plan for a better life, and my partner kind of does, no big future goals. But gladly my partner follows along and supports me as much as possible. So, a INFJ with a ESFP is not impossible",1615838604
ESFP,"ESXPs are opportunistic, so if they see that you are available they might continue",1615838085

But we all are sure about 1 thing, we ain't sure if she likes me too. 
She only liked a Guy once (and got into a short relationship) and that was a very bad experience for her. After that she never made it clear of she liked anyone after. So we are all clueless. 

She even evades questions about liking someone. Even her best Friends dont get an answer out of her. 

I only know they think that i would be a great boyfriend for her.



Okay i didn't mean to write this all downüòÖ anyway i am confessing to her soon :)",1615837832

ESFP,"I'd say it's not a common Enneagram type. More common in ENTJs and ESTPs.

So yeah, I think there really *is* someone for everyone.",1615644319

ESFP,Why do you keep making a new accounts??,1615632106
ESFP,"Firstly separate the mbti with the actual incident. 

Yes ESFPs can be sensitive (speaking on behalf of personal experience) and due to them being in the moment and staying in reality Se-ing around there is a chance they might be comparing a lot of stuff they see in their head with their own selves. (Again personal) 

However your situation is very different. This is cyberbullying the person is abusing your friend and hiding behind anonymity of social media. This would hurt anyone regardless of their type. It is an attack on someone‚Äôs mental health. It‚Äôs similar to saying if an infp cuts themselves would they bleed?

You should support your friend by calling out the anonymous ids via stories and talking to yourfriend about whatever incident happened between you all. 

Incidents like these can surely take a toll on someone‚Äôs mental health because the person who is doing this wants it to.

Your friends life probably means a lot to the dude who tells her to kill herself the way he‚Äôs spending time making IDs to harass her. Give her reassurance that what she is hearing is fake and made for the sole purpose so that she doubts herself.

ESFP,"I‚Äôve been feeling like I was hitting a wall with my productivity and development until I recently came across this wonderfully simple Japanese concept called Kaizen. Kaizen is the adoption of long-term improvement and productivity into one‚Äôs business and life.

The Japanese philosophy of Kaizen was first made popular by Toyota who adopted the lean manufacturing model in pursuit of constant and iterative improvement. It particularly effective to highlight strengths and reduce weaknesses. This philosophy has also been extended to the Deming Cycle which consists of 4 steps:

* Plan
* Do
* Check
* Act

This cycle has been growing in popularity not just in the corporate world, but also in personal productivity. I dive much deeper into Kaizen and the PDCA Model here - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoDs8tBcQvQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoDs8tBcQvQ)

So often we tend to pursue short-term growth instead of focusing on steady and continuous growth. Once you begin to make constant improvement a habit, I assure you that you‚Äôll likely be more successful and productive across different areas of your life.",1617465770

ESFP,"Sooooo I think you guys are great!!!! I do have some questions and your honest answers could be super helpful to me... 

1) What do you guys think about INFPs? In a romantic way? Are you attracted to them? Do you feel like there could be a basis for something longterm? (mostly interested in male ESFP vs female INFP) 

2) Is the guy I like (description below) an ESFP? 3 of my best friends are ESFP's but they're all female and so different from each other...  I just met this person so I'm afraid I don't have a lot of information about him, I just intuitively feel like there's strong Se and potentially Fi. 

3) How do you know if an ESFP is romantically interested?  

If you don't want to read everything trough, answering only the first and third question would also be helpful to me :) 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 23y INFP female and I'm a med student. I started my internship emergency about 1,5 week ago and I work with several different emergency physicians including someone who I think is a male ESFP. So I met him on the first day at work. At first I wasn't attracted to him because of his vibe, he acted very extroverted and hyper but he did make some jokes and talked to me on a more personal level than the other physicians did. The first thing he asked about me were my music preferences. I don't really know how to explain this very well but I don't really like to talk about music with someone I just met, I can easily talk about style, clothing, interior, arts... all kinds of aesthetics I prefer, but with music it's a bit more personal somehow. So he asked me about my music preference and felt like there could be 'wrong answers' so I just said 'nothing too commercial' and he thought that was acceptable. Afterwards I heard him talk about music a lot and commenting on the music that was playing and I sensed music is very important to him. He gave me huge Se vibes. Sometimes he asks me stuff like if I like skiing or snowboarding... The other physicians never ask me personal questions, but maybe he's like this with anyone. I just get the feeling that for him in order to connect with someone they need to have the same interests. This is definitely the case with all my female ESFP friends. I had to convince my best friend that she should stop looking for someone who was artistic just like her, and start looking more for a guy who complements her personality traits, since she would always date artistic guys but there never was a real connection. She really took my advice seriously, she always cares a lot about what I have to say about these things and now she's in a happy relationship with someone who appreciates her art but doesn't paint or draw himself. But for me, I don't mind there being differences, I even like it because I think it's more interesting to have different interests. I just feel like this guy is connecting with people based of on similarities. I'm afraid we're very different....

Anyway, I wasn't attracted to him at  first, he could be a bit blunt (but not impolite) and a bit loud, he was very present. I just felt like I couldn't read him, while I'm usually very good at reading people. It feels like his mind just works so different than mine, both his perception and judging function. But it's those things that repulsed me at first that actually made me like him all of a sudden. He's very authentic and doesn't really care about what other people think of him, definitely the 'I'd rather be weird than boring' kind of vibe. 

I'm definitely Fi dom, the Fi defines who I am, but whenever I take a test my Fe is the second highest and I wanted to study medicine to help people, listen to them and be their support. I don't know what his motives are to study medicine but I know he wanted to be a surgeon but wasn't selected. He doesn't seem to like the psychological part. He doesn't strike me as a Fe type, or maybe he does use Fe but it's not noticeable so to me it seems like there's Fi. 

Overall he seems to be someone who likes action, who likes adventure and who's probably bored very easily, just like my ESFP best friend. He's joking a lot and he's the one who changes the work atmosphere and connects with the people he works with. 

At this point I don't know if he's interested in me... all I know is that around him I'm joking so much more than I usually do. Yesterday he told me I was his favorite intern because I let him use my charger. One day I just arrive at work and walk past him, he definitely notices me but acts like he doesn't and he doesn't say hi... So obviously as an INFP I just mirror it but it gives me a strange feeling. A little bit later he'll start talking to me again and asking me questions again... Then ignoring me again... I just can't read him and it's so frustrating! I don't know, whenever I'm interested in someone I try to avoid them to protect myself because if I fall for someone, I fall hard. But I usually fail to stay away and be around that person anyway only to regret it later.... 

I don't know, writing this all down makes me wonder why I even initially thought he might be interested...  He's probably like this around anyone. I like the way he's just himself, no filter. I feel that he might be a little bit intrigued by me because I answer all of his questions so vaguely and I know I seem very down to earth and chill and even a bit mysterious... It might intrigue him, but it's all false, on the inside I'm just very anxious he might not like me when he gets to know me better... I feel like I'm not being brave, but I'm the intern, I can't really try to flirt with someone who might evaluate me later right? My brain is screaming 'stay away from him before you like him too much'...",1617329041

ESFP," 

I identified as INFP/ENFP, but recently, I feel that my ESFP side is appearing more and more. Maybe it's due to the lack of big and fun events due to COVID, and I feel my boredom and annoyance with routine starting to rear it's ugly head. DAE prefer doing something fun, ie. like water skiing, wild-water rafting, travelling overseas with your friends, as opposed to just sitting down at a table and talking? Today, I spent a lot of time by myself and I started reflecting. Some people like sitting down at a table and talking to 1, 2 or 3 or 4 people. Some are ok with bigger groups, like 8 people, and some prefer 1 to 1 conversations. But of late, I realise conversations aren't stimulating/interesting enough if you are not in a quaint, interesting cafe or doing something fun. If you know someone for a very long time, and you run out of topics to talk about, that's boring. However, if I have a crush on someone, even a trip to the park feels amazing. Some people hate big events and big parties, and clubbing, cause' of over-stimulation and sensory overload. But people like me feel underwhelmed by simple, routine, mundane activities. I can actually keep up with the energy of ESFPs as they are always doing fun and novel things.

Plus in a group, I always tend to shut off if no one talks to me, or if the topics are boring. Sometimes, even having like 8 people in a group is boring if you are just doing routine mundane stuff or just sitting around in a coffeeshop. I think this is part of the reason why I backslided from church a few times, because of my hedonistic personality probably.

If it's a boring conversation, I would rather binge watch youtube videos about pop culture, fashion, fun travel vlogs etc than engage in conversation. Like can anyone relate? Am I the only one out there? I am starting to flake out and really distance myself from people cause normal things are just so underwhelming to me.",1617116936

Is there a certain line between just flirting platonically for fun and flirting romantically with interest?

ESFP,"Can someone tell me this tendency of most ESFPs to put their pride and their wishes before thinking about the consequences of their actions?

An ESFP returned to my life and was looking to apologize because he dated me when I was quite young and he was older than me. He wasn't clear about the fact that he was not looking to be exclusive so when he told me he had sex with someone else, I left him. 

7 years later, he comes back into my life and looks to apologize. He rants about ALL of his  relationships over the years and all his family members in one seating. I was hoping to be friends but he takes me out to eat and refused to let me pay. Once we got into his car, he tried to make sexual moves and we ended up kissing.  

Then he ends up sexualizing every person I talk about (Especially if I mention a girl who was a different ethnic background from him). 

The next day, he's desperate to meet up with me. And during one of the days I mention that I am not going to meet up with him because of plans in my life, he says that he is horny and he'll find someone else to have sex with. .Fair enough, I try and stay friendly. 

I mention I am going to a friend's house, he tells me he wishes he could come  (there was a part of me that got the vibe that he found the notion of him hanging out with multiple girls sexy and at worst, envisioned a threesome), asks to drop me off, asks to steal me while I am there for a few hours .

Then finally gets mad when I refuse to meet him because I have other things to do. 

Truth is I reevaluated everything and realized I shouldn't meet him because of Covid-19 and especially not meet him since he goes around trying to meet up and have sex with girls whenever he could. 

The fact that he does that can potentially give me covid-19 and even STDs so when he gets mad, I tell him my worries. We stop talking for a week until he messages me again and I politely reply. 

&amp;#x200B;

He asks me to go out with him and I make up an excuse. He gets mad and tells me to ""not give him shit."" 

&amp;#x200B;

He sends voice messages stating that if things worked out, I could've been his wife and we could have had children. And how he likes me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I tell him that I am being polite and I always was. And reiterate my reasons of not going to see him. (STD and covid 19 given how sexually active he is). I told him I don't want to be his friends with benefits at this time because of covid and also because of how sexually active he is. And if we happen to be more, I know he would creep on my friends and everyone else associated with me and embarrass me because of his tendency to sexualize every female associated with me that he hasn't even met. I am sorry for being this honest but he left me with no choice. 

When ever I mention any girl when talking at all, his questions would be  is she pretty, is she your race (he kind of has a thing for girls from my background) He asked if my sister in law was a nice ""chocolate skinned beauty."" He wants me to bring ""my brother here who is suffering from depression, get him chicks and leave her with him""

&amp;#x200B;

He forgets half the things i told him, so he sends a voice message ranting about how I think I am so clean, virginal and perfect. ( I am not a virgin) How my parents as an only child lied to me how perfect I was. How when he was my age, he had money, he was this sports  champion, had a uni degree (I do too and am pursuing a post-grad which he completely forgot about), and how he has MORE money than all my family combined. 

He says how I don't believe in religion but yet stray away from his lewd jokes, and is surprised that I am not more sexually active? 

Then ranted about how diseases come from anywhere, and I could also give him a disease (I can't because I have not had sex in 2 years. Nor have I been frequently going out. My city is in lockdown, I am pursuing a post-graduate certificate program and I am being trained for a future job/role/designation through this certificate.

I've also had this issue with another girlfriend who was an ESFP. DID NOT LIKE IT WHEN I SAID NO TO HER. She also thought she was better than me because of how popular she was, how she was one of the guys' girls, how extraverted she was and was able to charm a whole room. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am an INFP and I don't know why but I've had such a tough time with ESFPs from them not being able to categorize me, to them never being able to understand anything. I don't think I am perfect.

I was ""best friends"" with her in  middle school though she never explicitly said this (we did hang out  frequently/I hung out with her the most from 6th to 8th grade) - around  8th grade, she and three girls she'd started hanging out w for the past 8  or so months cyber-bullied me in a social media group chat (they  insulted my clothing, implied that they'd called me ugly, called me  annoying, essentially revealed that they had been gossiping about me for  the past few months, etc.)  When high school came around, her mom told  me at a Parents Night that she wanted us to be friends again, and I was  fine w the idea sort of, but also had mixed feelings due to what had  happened.  I did try talking to her once in class by complimenting her  earrings, but rolled my eyes at the girl once when I saw her staring at  me/didn't approach her when she appeared like she was going to approach  me.  I'm black, she's black w a white adoptive mom

I  felt kind of guilty and did try to talk to her a few more times... but  now the occasional stares had turned into glares, she started  judgmentally staring at me.  I recall telling our PE teacher in front of  her and her friend (one of the girls who cyberbullied me) that I hated  middle school and wish I had gone somewhere else.  I remember she kind  of... wistfully stared at me and she seemed depressed in the class we  had after that even tho she j kind of looked a bit bothered when I said  it.  But then when I went up to approach her the next day that's when I  got the judgemental stare.

I tried  to message one of the girls who bullied me once j to make up w her  (though the girl is the one who technically started most of the drama,)  after a friend suggested I do, and my ex-best friend told me in class  (she sat behind me and I requested to switch seats after bc the  interaction was... intense.  I got the sense that she was going to hurt  me or something,) to not message the girl anymore.  I remember her  saying that the girl I messaged was her ""best friend"" and something abt  it felt... intentional?

And now  apparently when some social media accounts come up bullying different  girls at our school, and her friend group, she is insistent on it being  me (there was an account in middle school but she  denied that I owned it/waved it off even tho it was a rumor) to a point  where she tells people who are being bullied by the acc that it's me.   And when she and her best friend were apparently being cyberbullied by a  social media account/told to die by many social media accounts, she  actually tried calling my house and had two of her friends text me to  ask if I know who's ""behind the accounts.""

ESFP,"* Doesn't care to meet or speak to anyone unless she finds them interesting, which is usually only people who share her same fashion sense and makeup style (she refers to them as chic). With these people, she'll act friendly.
* With everyone else, she hardly speaks so people find her either quiet or snobby. Her demeanor isn't very approachable since she tends to speak with her natural resting bitch face expression
* She speaks freely without sugarcoating her words. This may make her come across rude at times but she doesn't care if people dislike her
* Since she doesn't care if people dislike her, she's also bold enough to confront people when something gets on her nerves. However she doesn't often engage in drama since she doesn't want to waste her energy arguing with people. Instead, she'll give a few witty comebacks then dismiss herself or tell the other person they're dismissed. 
* Enjoys spending her free time at home watching makeup tutorials, fashion vlogs, and other beauty guru stuff. If she's out, she enjoys shopping and eating at restaurants. 
* Works customer service at a retail shop and is majoring in marketing so she can have some career involving fashion in the future
* Prone to laziness especially with schoolwork; she has failed a few classes due to not trying hard enough but she doesn't care much about failing either. She's a big procrastinator who doesn't put much effort into her work
* Prone to being late to school and appointments. She prefers taking her time to get ready instead of rushing.
* Often believes she's right about her opinions and can be stubborn about it. A friend thinks being ""thicc"" is better but she keeps insisting looking skinny is the best and won't change her mind when the friend tries schooling her about how being underweight is unhealthy. Another friend thinks streetwear fashion looks really good, but she disagrees and won't budge when the friend tries convincing her how it looks good.
* In relation to the last point, she can be judgmental about people who are too different from her. She judges overweight people because she finds them visually unattractive and because she's all about being skinny and she judges ""manliness"" on women (i.e. women spreading their legs sitting or being overly athletic) because she's all about being ""chic and girly"".
* She's very into looking skinny and girly to the point of a lot of people finding it to be fake because it seems overdone like she's posing and changing her natural voice tone higher. She's constantly talking about everything skinny and girly, so I believe she wants everyone to see her a specific way.
* Very materialistic; her tumblr blog was full of high-end designer photos such as Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Celine, YSL, and more. She doesn't own many designer items, but she thinks it's goals to have a huge closet full of everything designer.

ESFP,"Hello, everyone I recently have been studying about sensory processing sensitivity (SPS) which is an attribute of highly sensitive persons (HSPs). I am curious to see if certain MBTI types are more likely to be HSPs than others, so I am going to post a poll in each subreddit about this. **You can find out if you are an HSP by taking the following test:** [**Are You Highly Sensitive? ‚Äì The Highly Sensitive Person (hsperson.com)**](https://hsperson.com/test/highly-sensitive-test/)**. A score higher than 14 on this test indicates that you might have SPS (you are an HSP).** If you do not like the binary nature of this test you can take the version used by researchers here: [Microsoft Word - HSPSCALE\_2007\_research.doc (hsperson.com)](http://hsperson.com/pdf/HSPSCALE_2007_research.pdf). A score of 105 or higher on this version indicates that you likely are an HSP (I calculated this cutoff by using the cutoff for the shorter version which is 15/27 possible points and assuming that the same percentage of points on the longer test indicates that you are an HSP). **If you are willing please take the test to see if you are an HSP and then fill out the poll below. Thank you.**

I am also going to post some research articles here for those of you who would like to learn more about HSPs and the research behind it (I am quoting from another post that I made about this):

""Hello everybody, I have recently been looking at various studies regarding HPSs. To be honest when I first heard about HSPs I thought that the idea was either a false pop psychology idea, or autism spectrum disorder or anxiety disguised under a fancy name. However, after reading the studies I will list below I am now convinced that sensory processing sensitivity (SPS) is real and that being an HSP is a unique, valid concept. I believe these studies are useful to get an in-depth understanding of what it truly means to be an HSP and they can also be useful to show that the idea of HSPs is valid. Here are the studies:

[The functional highly sensitive brain: a review of the brain circuits underlying sensory processing sensitivity and seemingly related disorders (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5832686/) (Discusses fMRI studies of SPS in comparison to autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, and post-traumatic stress disorder. This review shows that SPS is its own separate, unique trait and is different from the previously mentioned disorders)

[The highly sensitive brain: an fMRI study of sensory processing sensitivity and response to others' emotions - PubMed (nih.gov)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25161824/) (Provides evidence that higher HSP scores are correlated with ‚Äústronger activation of brain regions involved in awareness, empathy, and self-other processing‚Äù)

[The trait of sensory processing sensitivity and neural responses to changes in visual scenes (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3023077/) (‚ÄúSPS was associated with significantly greater activation in brain areas involved in high-order visual processing (i.e. right claustrum, left occipitotemporal, bilateral temporal and medial and posterior parietal regions) as well as in the right cerebellum, when detecting minor (*vs* major) changes in stimuli.‚Äù)

[Sensory Processing Sensitivity Predicts Individual Differences in Resting-State Functional Connectivity Associated with Depth of Processing - PubMed (nih.gov)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33561863/) (‚ÄúThe present study showed that SPS is associated with \[resting-state\] brain connectivity implicated in attentional control, consolidation of memory, physiological homeostasis, and deliberative cognition. These results support theories proposing ""depth of processing"" as a central feature of SPS and highlight the neural processes underlying this cardinal feature of the trait.‚Äù)

[Higher sensory processing sensitivity, introversion and ectomorphism: New biomarkers for human creativity in developing rural areas (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3409988/) (Discusses various aspects of SPS such as its involvement in creativity and also its presence in animals)

[Temperament trait of sensory processing sensitivity moderates cultural differences in neural response (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2894664/) (‚ÄúHere, 10 European-Americans and 10 East Asians underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing simple visuospatial tasks emphasizing judgments that were either context independent (typically easier for Americans) or context dependent (typically easier for Asians). As reported elsewhere, each group exhibited greater activation for the culturally non-preferred task in frontal and parietal regions associated with greater effort in attention and working memory. However, further analyses, reported here for the first time, provided preliminary support for moderation by SPS. Consistent with the careful-processing theory, high-SPS individuals showed little cultural difference; low-SPS, strong culture differences.‚Äù)

However, in contrast to Aron and Aron‚Äôs finding that the scale is unidimensional, the current results support a three-component structure consisting of Aesthetic Sensitivity (AES), Low Sensory Threshold (LST), and Ease of Excitation (EOE).‚Äù ‚ÄúAES showed the strongest relation with Openness to Experience, while LST and EOE were found to be most closely associated with Neuroticism.‚Äù Unfortunately, this study is not free access, but if you are a student or faculty at a school you might be able to get access to the full text through your institution.)

[The relationships between sensory processing sensitivity, alexithymia, autism, depression, and anxiety - ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886908001281) (‚ÄúThe goal of the current investigation was to better understand the relationships between the three recently-developed factors of sensory processing sensitivity (ease of excitation ‚Äì EOE, low sensory threshold ‚Äì LST, and aesthetic sensitivity ‚Äì AES) and alexithymia, autism symptoms, anxiety, and depression. Two hundred and one college students completed the highly sensitive person scale, as well as measures of anxiety, depression, alexithymia, and autism symptoms. EOE and LST were related to autism symptoms, alexithymia, anxiety, and depression. AES was related to attention to details (a symptom of autism) and anxiety but not to depression. It was also negatively related to externally-oriented thinking (a symptom of alexithymia). Results indicate that AES is conceptually distinct from LST and EOE. Furthermore, EOE interacted with difficulty identifying feelings in predicting anxiety, indicating that being both easily excited by stimuli and unable to identify one‚Äôs feelings is particularly anxiety provoking.‚Äù)

[A psychometric evaluation of the Highly Sensitive Person Scale in ethnically and culturally heterogeneous South African samples | SpringerLink](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12144-020-00988-7) (The HSPS scale was tested for cross-cultural reliability via administration of the test to a group of students from a South African university. The HSPS scale was found to be reliable in this study and ‚ÄúFactor analysis revealed a novel five-factor solution (Negative Affect, Neural Sensitivity, Propensity to Overwhelm, Careful Processing and Aesthetic Sensitivity). As per previous reports, latent class analysis suggested a three class solution.‚Äù The study also discusses some weaknesses of the HSPS scale that could be improved such as the lack of reverse-coding in the assessment to address agreeability bias (i.e. reversing statements to make them negative). For example, I avoid violent movies could be easily reverse coded by switching the wording to I enjoy violent movies, but the original scale does not do this for any of the questions.)

[Dandelions, tulips and orchids: evidence for the existence of low-sensitive, medium-sensitive and high-sensitive individuals - PubMed (nih.gov)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29353876/) (‚ÄúWhile we were able to identify a highly sensitive (orchids, 31%) and a low-sensitive group (dandelions, 29%), we also detected a third group (40%) characterised by medium sensitivity, which we refer to as tulips in keeping with the flower metaphor.‚Äù ‚Äúthe three groups differed in neuroticism, extraversion and emotional reactivity to positive mood induction with orchids scoring significantly higher in neuroticism and emotional reactivity and lower in extraversion than the other two groups (dandelions also differed significantly from tulips).‚Äù ‚Äú**Findings suggest that environmental sensitivity is a continuous and normally distributed trait** but that people fall into three distinct sensitive groups along a sensitivity continuum.‚Äù)

[Sensory Processing Sensitivity and its association with personality traits and affect: A meta-analysis - ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0092656619300583) (‚ÄúSPS in children correlated with Neuroticism (*r‚ÄØ=*‚ÄØ0.42) but did not with Extraversion, Openness, Agreeableness or Conscientiousness.

ESFP,"I'm not sure if this means I've always been an ESFP, but depression made me intuitive. Or if the medication prevents me from thinking abstractly, therefore I'm no longer an ENFP.


Out of fascination, I've taken the 16personality test several times a year since I was 18. I always got ENFP. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and put on geodon 60mg/nightly when I was 21 (I'm 22 now). I've taken the test several times since then and keep getting ESFP. The percentage was a dramatic change from mostly intuitive to mostly sensing. 

To be honest neither type feels 100% like me. I've done so much reading and I relate to both but neither one completely. But I do think I was more self-fascinated before. I cared mostly about talking through societal views and worldly concepts. I was very in my head and wanted to ""figure myself out"" on other people. I could be selfish. I care more about people now, about what they have to say even if it's just surface level. I still enjoy philosophical discussions and can certainly entertain an abstract idea (did this recently with an INFJ) because it reminds me of how I used to see the world. 

Now, I think I'm just as happy to be discussing any topic as a means of connecting with people on their own level as opposed to seeking out nonstop intuition. Before, I believed being able to communicate intuitively was a super power and that it meant you were on a ""higher frequency"". But I have just as easy a time if not better getting along with people now than I did before. 

I also want to go to school and get married and have kids which is something I never wanted before. I was content just ""hoping"" for things. Not really thinking much about the future. It was really weird in comparison. 

I didnt realize this would turn into me bashing my former self but bear in mind this was also when I was sick (unmedicated) so please, ENFPs, don't take it personal. Honestly sometimes I think about getting off medication to be an ENFP again. 

I didn't even know this was possible, according to research your personality type is fixed. I tend to think people who get different results either enter into depression or just don't know themselves that well.

Summary Analysis of Profile
By focusing on the strongest configuration of cognitive processes, your pattern of responses most closely matches individuals of this type: ISFP

Lead (Dominant) Process
Introverted Feeling (Fi): Staying true to who you really are. Paying close attention to your personal identity, values and beliefs. Checking with your conscience. Choosing behavior congruent with what is important to you.

Support (Auxilliary) Process
Extraverted Sensing (Se): Immersing in the present context. Responding naturally to everything tangible you detect through your senses. Checking with what your gut instincts say. Testing limits and take risks for big rewards.

If these cognitive processes don't fit well then consider these types: ESFP, or INFP

Soo I think I'm an ESTP but this was my type me post on some communities and what got me thinking I might not be one was an ESFP comment. What made me think that is that they're similar in many things so I think it's easy for someone to not be certain about these two. I posted the same thing in the ESTP community as well and the comments said it sounded like an ESTP but I wanted to see what you guys think as well. Am I mostly an ESFP or an ESTP? 

(The traits' list is random not from most to least important or sth similar) 

‚Ä¢ I'm a 14yo girl and an only child

‚Ä¢ I have this positive vibe and I try to deal with bad things that happen by joking and not getting too serious
. 
‚Ä¢ I am generally an optimistic person as mentioned above but my decisions and the way I judge things are realistic.
 
‚Ä¢ I am courageous and brave and I really like to be the first one that tries sth difficult or sth considered dangerous. I feel so proud after that. 

‚Ä¢ I am opinionated and I'm not scared to voice these opinions. 

‚Ä¢ Whenever a friend of mine has a problem and they come to me, I usually try to comfort them by offering them solutions and making them see the issue from a more positive perspective. 

‚Ä¢ Emotional displays make me uncomfortable

‚Ä¢ I tend to be tense in environments where I try sth new that requires people who know things about the subject I'm trying having their attention on me. For example, I used to take vocal lessons (I stopped a month ago) and I was in a band with other kids. You cannot imagine the stress I was feeling every time I was there. But in contrast, in my guitar lessons (which I also stopped) when I was at a concert and the audience was looking at me, I didn't feel nervous. Ig it's because not all of them had knowledge on the subject or sth? 

‚Ä¢ I'm also reserved around people I don't know well but when I start opening up or when I'm around my friends, I'm very talkative and quite loud. 

‚Ä¢ I hate feeling ordinary, ignorant and the same as everybody else (but I've heard that's a teen issue so idk) 

‚Ä¢ I had a short temper and an attitude since I was little. 

‚Ä¢ I'm always up to try new things. 

‚Ä¢ I'm ambitious 

‚Ä¢ I respect a lot people who are fair and honest no matter what

‚Ä¢ I can make tough calls

‚Ä¢ I like studying in depth and get as much knowledge as possible about a subject I'm interested in

‚Ä¢ I have a good imagination

‚Ä¢ I am caring and I like to give to people but when I don't receive even sth small in return I start getting bitter. 

‚Ä¢ I'm selfless yet selfish. 

‚Ä¢ I'm down to earth and I understand where my abilities stop or begin, self-aware. 

‚Ä¢ During my childhood, I've taken up many hobbies and then gave up on them. I took drawing, ballet (ew), volleyball, vocal and guitar lessons only to drop them later on although I have to admit I was taking guitar lessons for 4-5 years (before going to an auditorium this year and then I decided to stop, ughh I hope you understand the story, I explain it better below) and traditional dance lessons for 9-10. The dance genre choice has nothing to do with a desire to preserve the past, it was simply the only dance lesson around and all my friends would go. It taught me tho how to have a sense of unison because we were so many people that we attended festivals and organized celebrations altogether so it will always have a place in my heart haha. 

‚Ä¢ This year is the only year I don't have an activity. Well I had the vocal and guitar lessons until last month as I said but now I only have my Spanish lessons. At first, I didn't like that I didn't have sth to do outside the lessons. I was so used in doing sth so I felt weird and unproductive which I hate. But after some time I realized that it's okay and that I've tried many things and it doesn't matter if not all of them worked out. Now I'm writing a book and I hope it turns out long enough and not run out of ideas lmao. 

‚Ä¢ Also, I forgot. The reason I quit the vocal and guitar lessons in the auditorium was because it was so based on theory yk and it just got tiring. I didn't like this formal approach. 

‚Ä¢ My interests vary and I'm down to anything. Deep conversations, a football game, vibing to songs, pulling pranks, whatever it is I like to try. 

‚Ä¢ My current hobbies include writing, reading, searching up stuff I'm interested in, listening to a lot of music and hanging out with my friends. 

‚Ä¢ I usually get stressed out easily but I'm able to think calmly and smartly under stressful situations. 

‚Ä¢ I'm kind and polite until you push my buttons. If that happens, I can roast you just by being honest about you lmao. 

‚Ä¢ When I'm angry, I've got told I get blunt and rude. 

‚Ä¢ I am skeptical about authorities or different ideologies (eg religion) but that doesn't mean I act like a bitch around them. I don't feel the need to do it tbh. 

‚Ä¢ I hate people who think they own the place they're in and start bossing around. Prove you're capable and then we'll discuss about leadership. 

‚Ä¢ I make a good leader and people rely on me in projects, advice etc but I like to focus on team effort as well. Inclusion is important and I don't want people feeling they're left out. 

‚Ä¢ I'm confident I can talk my way out of most situations. I have this ""skill"" to justify everything I say and support my views. 

‚Ä¢ I respect people's boundaries. 

‚Ä¢ I have impulses but my self control is good and it takes over when I sense things get out of hand. 

‚Ä¢ When two of my friends fight, I'm usually the one who will find the middle ground but when I fight with someone I'm fierce and don't back down at all. 

‚Ä¢ I'm sensitive to different sounds and I'm a picky eater. 

‚Ä¢ I'm passionate and when I work on sth I really enjoy, I give my whole self. 

‚Ä¢ I'm loyal and I don't give up on the people I care about.
 
‚Ä¢ I receive the world around me in a cynical way but I believe that an improvement can be made. 

‚Ä¢ I was independent and wanted to do things on my own since I was a little kid. 

‚Ä¢ I don't ask for help and I want to achieve everything on my own. If I don't, it is half the achievement. 

‚Ä¢ I'm proud but I don't overestimate myself. 

‚Ä¢ I like helping people but I don't believe the world or even relationships are founded on only love and compassion. 

‚Ä¢ I'm energetic and fun to be around

‚Ä¢ People trust me a lot

‚Ä¢ People assume I'm always relaxed and sure idky but I'm not always this stable 

‚Ä¢ I'm an overthinker and whenever I notice a difference of attitude/vibe/movement of someone I'm worried I said sth wrong

‚Ä¢ I always try to do my best out of how every situation has turned out

‚Ä¢ I lack patience and I wait instant results in everything I do

‚Ä¢ I think creatively 

‚Ä¢ I'm afraid of being seen or actually being incompetent

‚Ä¢ I get really stubborn when someone criticizes me

‚Ä¢ I am understanding and I can see a problem from many angles and analyze it

ESFP,"Life can often get overwhelming. There are plenty of responsibilities and obligations that we have on a daily basis. We often even need to make important decisions that not just impact ourselves, but other too. I struggled with all of this and realized that I needed some kind of anchor. That‚Äôs when I started delving a lot into Stoicism.

I‚Äôve learned that there are essentially 2 main pillars of Stoicism that help shape one‚Äôs frame of mind and approach life in a better way

* The Dichotomy of Control: This is framework for channeling energy towards the things we truly control, and relinquishing control over everything else
* Stoic Virtues: There are four cardinal virtues that help shape a Stoic outlook on life and everything that shapes it.

These two pillars are the cornerstone for anyone looking to get a better introduction to Stoicism. I‚Äôve explained and illustrated the practical applications of the Stoic pillars here - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmDKXSGJoII](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmDKXSGJoII)

ESFP," Theory: Chiron's bully, Terrell, was closeted and had a crush on Chiron. Whilst he makes fun of Chiron, there is a scene in the film in which Chiron catches Terrell staring at him in the classroom - his stare appears to be one of infatuation (he looks Chiron up and down, checking him out. It is clearly not a stare of contempt and the camera lingers on him too long for it to not mean something...) He seems to be particularly focused on Chiron, even following him home from school at one point with his friend (to tease him, yes, but why spend so much on time on one person? And some of the comments he makes seem a bit suggestive (""Now I ain't with that gay shit, but if you fuck with me, I'll give your ass more than you can handle,"" ""Why yo jeans so tight? His nuts must be choking in them I swear...,"")

In conclusion, my theory is that Chiron's bully from ""Moonlight"" was in the closet and actually had a thing for him.

I remember overhearing (though they didn't intentionally say it loud so I could hear them, I j heard them from across the classroom,) his friend ask him why he was staring at me (if he was doing it bc he liked me,) and he said that it was bc he was trying to figure out why I looked so sad all the time. He then glanced me over and said, ""Besides, I couldn't go out w her. She's average. 5/10."" He then looked at me for a few more seconds and said, ""Actually... below average. 4/10."" We were in freshman yr of hs (I think that he was an ESTP.)

But I'm wondering what his reasoning for staring the other times was. I remember he once like, idk, started staring at me when I was walking down the halls w a friend and he was w his friends and like we j both kind of stared at each other and I get the sense that he was like, maybe going to come up and talk to me? I felt weird bc he was w his friends, I almost got the sense that he was going to introduce me to them? He stared at me for like a while... I ended up walking away w my friend but idk what he wanted. And then I remember he stopped once to stare at me (but I was far away, talking to a friend when we were prepping for a track meet,) even though class had already started... he was j def staring at me while I was talking to her. And there are like 1 or 2 other incidents, what was probs his reasoning?

Hey , hope I'm in the right place , So I'm a male INFP 19 , and I have only one friend irl who's my best friend also lol , and I tried to type him many times in the past but I failed and mistyped him many times , so myabe someone here could help me out , So here is a description of him

\- He's beautiful and energetic , he values beauty very much , he pays attention to looks (how people dressed ) , like when my hair is wrong or when I wear a new beautiful outfit , he immediately pay attention to it and give me a compliment about it.

\- He really hates routine and he would die for new enjoyable experiences , like going to new places , nature ... ect , and he told me that his ideal job is a job where there is interaction with people ofc (he told me that he would not survive in a job where he stays in a desk alone for long time ) , and also where they change places or travel every few months , because he hates routine very much , and I told him ""sorry but that job doesn't exist in our country , but I really hope you'll find a way to do it""

\- I thought in the past he's introverted , but he's not , he just wasn't with the right people , in this covid era I discovered that he's probably extraverted , cause he got bored and had low enery in this covid period for a lot of time , and when he came back to hanging out with his friends in UNI , he became very energetic and happy . he likes social events where there is a lot of people , but he's also very good with one on one interaction like with me , besides his friends in uni , he hangouts only with me , and I told him a lot of time to make friends and socialize , cause he's ont an introvert like me he's an extraverted type of person who derives his energy from the outer world , but he always told me that he don't like most people's mentality or personality or he's not interested in them , since he was bullied in middle school .

\- He's A big feeler like me and I really love him for many things , he is the one who helped me change in high school , when I was bullying him sometimes unintentially to gain respect from others ( and I didn't forgive that part of myself , I still hate it :( ) but I'm really greateful he helped me change . He told me in high school : ""when we're only me &amp; you we're great , but when we're in a group you start making fun of me or anyone else , why ?"" , ""I told him yeah I really do , I'm a piece of shit , and then I started changing "" , so now we onky hangout one on one and I really make sure we're not backbiting people or making fun or insulting ....

\- He loves animes &amp; movies , and he really like telling stories , he's a really good story teller and he enjoys it very much , and his life is always changing , he hates discipline like making a schedule and following it and he loves chillin out , laughing , not overthinking , he lives in the moment

in the past I thought he's an INFP like me , but after this covid period and after some reflction  
I came to the conclusion that he's maybe an : EXFP , I still don't know X cause I didn't read about it a lot and I find it hard to distnguish between N and S

if you made it to the end , I really appreciate you , and I would really like to see what type do you think my best friend is since you guys are ESFPs and thanks ‚ô• !",1614022422

ESFP,"If you‚Äôre like me, you likely spend a lot of your day juggling various tasks and finding effective ways to multitask. This is probably because you feel like you‚Äôre getting more done. However, THIS COULD NOT BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH.

There has been plenty of research that has shown how every time we jump from one task to another, a little bit of our brain‚Äôs attention is still focused on that previous task. This is called **Attention Residue**. Ultimately, this requires more time to get familiarized with a task every time we switch back and forth.

We need to realize that while we can do a variety of things, our brains are simply not able to focus on more than one thing at a time. That‚Äôs why anytime you watch TV while scrolling though your phone‚Ä¶ or you cook while listening to an audiobook, you likely don‚Äôt recall something well or even mess something up.

There‚Äôs plenty of experiments that have been conducted on this. My favorite metaphor is comparing our brain to a zoom lens with limited ability to focus. I explain this in depth here - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfjad0VyDvc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfjad0VyDvc)

ESFP,"So I‚Äôve been seeing this ESFP (f) for 6 months now. And we both are looking to form a long term relationship with one another.

We both got along very well at the beginning. But then I noticed that I‚Äôm putting in most of the effort into the relationship, always the first one to text, and I‚Äôm always trying to align my schedule with hers, she‚Äôs not very expressive, doesn‚Äôt even seem like she has shown that much interest in me and the things that I enjoy. And no matter how much, effort I was putting in, she wasn‚Äôt satisfied. She always wanted more attention.

Anyways, months went by and I did bring up the above things to her, from time to time, and she kinda dismissed them or said she‚Äôd put in more effort, and maybe she did for a few days and things went back to normal. I didn‚Äôt realize what was going on at that time. She kept assuring me that she cared about me a lot, and that she wasn‚Äôt good at putting it into words sometimes. But that she‚Äôs fully committed to me. 

The other day, we were talking and I brought up an emotional conversation that she and I were having a few days ago, and I thought it was an important moment that we shared but she didn‚Äôt even remember it. And then it just kinda hit me, that she‚Äôs not invested into this relationship as much as I am, and that she doesn‚Äôt care about me the way I do about her.  

And then everything started to make sense. Any time I tried to bring up boundaries or my needs, she would just make me feel guilty about it, telling me that I don‚Äôt want to talk to her. And then it would always end up with me trying to make her feel better.

Anyways, I brought this whole thing up to her and she got upset. But then after, she spent some thinking on her own and she agreed, that the whole thing was her fault and she just wasn‚Äôt able to see what she was doing. And that she does care about me. She apologized many times and claims that she‚Äôs going to change. And what she did to me was unfair.

J/P is reversed in Socionics for introverts, mind you. The lead function for ISTj (ISTP in MBTI) is Ti, which is a judging function, thus ISTj rather than P.

ESFP,"hey y‚Äôall! i just realized i actually have 4 as my main enneagram because it explains a lot of things that i never could really figure out before

 1. as a little kid, i was extremely emotional and easy to set off for no real reason. i couldn‚Äôt tell if i was an Fi dom for a bit because i didn‚Äôt actually feel like i was ever SUPER DUPER involved with the present. however, i really enjoyed and still do learning about different things, particularly science such as astronomy and biology. probably one of my favorite things in life is absorbing knowledge, which would be why i‚Äôm always watching a random youtube video pretty much whenever i‚Äôm eating a meal.

2. even though being alone can be nice if i‚Äôm aiming to get something done, i don‚Äôt get energy from it and i‚Äôd usually rather be with other people. however, being in a boring environment even with other people is probably what drains me the most. also, because i‚Äôve struggled with depression for a bit it‚Äôs been sometimes hard for me to socialize with people, considering i‚Äôm not that assertive of a person either. for the longest time i thought i was an introvert. (nonono if i hear any of you talk about me being an ESFP-T because i say i‚Äôm not assertive that‚Äôs straight up not true, the assertive turbulent scale is a bunch of bs). if i‚Äôm stuck in a boring environment with people, i usually go and do things without other people like look at my phone because simply interacting with people isn‚Äôt always as stimulating as simply doing something material. however, doing something by myself in the company of other people does make me feel a bit sad, i‚Äôve been working on asserting myself in order to actually receive the attention i occasionally yearn for. i do really enjoy talking to people and doing things with them. my idea of fun is going somewhere exciting with a good group of friends like an amusement park or arcade, or perhaps even going on a hike. *basic summary of this ramble of a paragraph: i can be quiet but i enjoy being around people*

3. i am pretty enamored with self expression. i put a little too much thought into what i wear and feel pretty whole and accomplished when i write a song that i enjoy listening to. i‚Äôm also obsessed with how other people perceive me. i also have specific hobbies that i‚Äôm passionate about including playing/writing music, playing smash bros, learning science related things, and ofc mbti. 

4. i struggled for a long time cause i wanted to know myself extremely well but didn‚Äôt even know what i wanted out of life, how others perceive me, who i was in general. i felt really empty and i actually feel like mbti and enneagram has helped me out a lot with determining what my ideal self looks like and also determining what my tendencies are. i‚Äôm a strong believer that mbti and enneagram isn‚Äôt 100% scientific, but it damn well works. it‚Äôs not like astrology where it is based off of when, at some random and otherwise meaningless point in history, you were born, but it is based off real world research and if revised to some degree could most definitely be used in the world of science. 

5. depression (as stated before, or general mental illness): it‚Äôs mostly because of the experiences i‚Äôve been through whether that being bullied for being autistic as a child, and having to deal with negligence and domestic abuse at home for a while. not too long ago, i thought being autistic was a defective trait and that i wasn‚Äôt capable of being a normal, respectable human being because of it. after therapy, i‚Äôve realized it‚Äôs just a trait that makes me different and i don‚Äôt really give it that much attention, but if i do i just think it‚Äôs a trait that sets me apart from other people. i mean, i wouldn‚Äôt be who i am currently if it weren‚Äôt for it. 

if you got this far, thank you so much for reading i really appreciate it &lt;3 i‚Äôd love to chat with any of you about your guys‚Äô experiences",1613245277
ESFP,"Hi everyone!!! I (an ENFJ) started dating an ESFP back in November and we‚Äôve known each other since September. At first he was very adverse to the idea of commitment at first and he had never had a girlfriend before at age 26. I really think that is because of the ESFP‚Äòs adverse reaction to commitment. But we have really been doing well and he is so fun. 

Naturally the the idea of having a partner is a bit foreign to him, but I am working with him and being patient. I‚Äôm also just giving him attention and just loving on him and he‚Äôs opened up a lot and has been more vulnerable lately. 

He always makes me laugh and he is so lighthearted all the time. He communicates pretty logically and I feel like he balances out my tendency to feel a lot/get fired up about things. I love that he always wants to do something fun yet enjoys his alone time.

ESFP,"We generally tend to approach our lives with a few key principles, whether we realize it or not. Sometimes those principles can be things like honesty, decency, integrity, etc. I‚Äôve recently been exploring the depths of Stoic philosophy and found that there are 4 key virtues that allow one to approach life with a stoic mindset and ultimately move closer to a more fulfilling existence.

The 4 Stoic Virtues are:

* Phron√™sis or Wisdom
* Dikaiosyn√™ or Justice
* S√¥phrosyn√™ or Temperance
* Andreia or Courage

These cardinal virtues are what the stoics explain as pivotal to living a life that brings true happiness and purpose. I explain them in depth here and how one can apply them - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5v0JGjWGyqs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5v0JGjWGyqs)

What does a good ""chat"" with you look like? What things do you like to discuss, and how do I go into a productive, prolonged talk with you? What are some do's and don'ts, and why?

Recently I've been in touch over text with an ESFP classmate. We've discussed our interests and we're unbelievably similar, but I always get lost in conversation with her. I've noticed that we're mutually blind to how each other wants to direct a conversation. She's open to tell what she's doing and how she feels towards anything, but she doesn't catch on to my attempts to move into a deeper conversation - instead I get responses that are more like reactions. Similarly, I'm open to break down or interpret any topic, but it takes suuuper long for me to catch on to her advances.

In technical terms, I know INTP and ESFP are blind to each other's dominant functions. My tertiary Si is fairly developed so I should be able to connect to her Se, but I struggle to catch on with what is happening in the first place. It's often taken me almost days to respond because I've been planning my approach (yes feel free to make fun of that), just for the outcome to go in a completely unexpected direction.

Any help would be appreciated, and overall this is a great opportunity to learn about each other. As for me, I'm still waiting for a response from her, but any conversation where I don't know what I'm doing is a wasted opportunity :/",1613181821

They have been venting to friends but not said anything directly to the boys

They remember what one of the boys said abt them going on tangents, and decide when they have their prep meeting again that they'll be muted/quiet unless spoken to or asked for their input. However, they notice that now that they are muted, both boys are unmuted and talk to each other abt which song to choose/their classes/general stuff (the boys essentially j talk to each other now that the girl is muted.)

She does sit through it but feels angry, that the boys j wanted to chat w each other, that they are making the org+club involvement exclusive to themselves even though she did a lot of work, unwanted... by the time that 15 minutes have passed she is very upset, though she still does not say anything, and even though she understands that they need to prep for the meeting, she feels strongly unwanted and that they j want to be by themselves... and so, although she wouldn't normally, she leaves the meeting abruptly, almost impulsively, without notice 15 minutes in, as they are j talking to each other while she has been on mute for most of the time.

She feels weird abt it and knows that it will cause a rift but cries to herself, vents to friends some more, and doesn't re-join the meeting. She admits to one of the boys when he messages her that she felt unwanted/disliked, and is generally a lot more quiet in meetings w them moving forward (tho she is touched by the boy apologizing/clearing things up)

He takes literally everything as they come, even in relationships, and I'm worried that he will fall to temptations and drop me in a heartbeat. 

I've been trying to talk with him about future plans since I wanna see where the relationship is going and I wanna look forward to some things, but he's even uncertain of his own future. He said that he'll do things when he feels it's right, and that he's never, ever gonna plan. 

He has been confused about his feelings lately, but it starts to get positive again. He said that the temptations grow stronger and stronger. He works at a grocery store, and he sees both colleagues and customers. He also had an eye for a colleague. I told him about my jealousy yesterday (for the first time in my life, I have experienced jealousy), and he reassured me about his feelings for me even if it's not as strong as my feelings for him, and that he might only see that colleague once a month at most. 

I've been back and forth about moving to his city, and he got irritated. I tried to set a date to close the distance (summer next year), but now I'm scared and I'll never move to his city. He doesn't have too much work experience either, and education isn't in place, so he has to live in his city. I'm his first serious girlfriend too btw. 

Is it just an ESFP thing to almost not plan at all, or am I just being a placeholder girlfriend? Is there any way to resolve things (like distance, temptations, etc...)? Will he let himself fall in love with someone if he meets a colleague often? Will he drop me in a heartbeat?

ESFP,"Ryuji Sakamoto MBTI ESFP - Persona 5 MBTI Types

Ryuji ESFP - Persona 5 Myers-Briggs Types

Ryuji is a ESFP from Persona 5, he's a Se dom and Fi aux user, he is not a ESTP, not even close. I saw that mistype for him once and I completely disagree, Ryuji acts nothing like a ESTP and is definitely a ESFP and Fi user.

""Crap, I hear footsteps comin'! Lots of 'em!"" Ryuji Se coming out in this scene as a dom Se user and ESFP character. Ryuji is a ESFP character that's always relying on his senses, notices details, and lives being fully in the moment. He's also very impulsive and spontaneous in the game and very hotheaded too. He asks why does everything have to be so complicated to morgana and struggles a bit to understand the concept Morgana is talking about at first.

He's bad at grasping concepts and ideas when Morgana explains them like with trying to explain how Kamoshida's palace works. Of course theres plenty of intelligent ESFPs out there but Ryuji's case even if he can be smart too in the game he's just bad at grasping concepts immediately. He lives by his morals and values strongly and cares a lot about authenticity showing his clear aux Fi. Morgana tells him to not be so angry and emotional and to calm down in the Kamoshida palace when there talking. Ryuji feels strongly and emotionally the entire Kamoshida scene before his Persona transformation. His Fi is stirred and pushed hard in this scene as he speaks about his dark past on the track team with him. His aux Fi is driven and he even gets roasted for being too emotional again by Kamoshida again here in this scene, his emotions are shot and pushed to his limits. His Fi is pushed so much as he says all the things he's emotionally angry about at Kamoshida in this scene and it drives him with his strong emotions and Fi moments in this scene to his ultimate Persona transformation, Captain Kidd. Things get badass and he can Joker get up and start the fight and go in as the cool rock music plays.

Ryuji at times cares about efficiency with his Te tertiary, he wants to usually hurry up and get things done and is a goal oriented person even if his Te is usually weak and he's laid back and bad at school and getting things done most the time. His Te efficiency is usually focused on things he's interested in doing like stopping a bad guy or corrupt adult or going to something fun with the group as well. He hates studying and struggles with it and procrastinates like Ann who is ENFP in her case.

Ryuji usually jumps into things without thinking and is not very future oriented and not the best planner. People roast him a lot and say he's dumb and he even admits it himself once, but he has plenty of smart moments in the game too like with speculating things Shido might do and so on and some insightful things he said in the game at different moments. He had an amazing moment when he saved the party by running and getting the life boat even with a bad leg in Shido's palace. His friends thought he was dead but in the end he made it out of the explosion somehow. He's always a great best friend and he takes responsibility for his actions, especially in the Royal Maruki content and apology he gave, all the cast apologized but Ryujis was the most genuine of them all. Ryuji is usually used for comic relief and thinks a lot things of overcomplicated and struggles to get concepts usually but despite this he's an amazing character and a amazing best friend to Joker and has a heart of gold and amazing morality in the game and it just a great person in general. He's one of my favorite ESFP characters as of late, he's up there with Kuwabara from Yu Yu Hakusho and I love him and his character in the Persona 5 game. Thanks for reading.",1612286121

First of all let me preface this post by saying that I am an ENTP- an ENTP 5w4, which is definitely a rarer type of ENTP.

Usually ENTPs are Type 7 Enneagrams, so they are more random, spontaneous, energetic, fun-loving, debating, full of ideas, etc.

I am a Type 5, which are typically a lot calmer, more introspective and philosophical, and are more interested in narrowing down ideas like an INTP than generating constant ideas just for the sake of generating ideas. But we still have the playfulness, cleverness, and toned down mischievousness of a Type 7. Think Cheshire Cat from Alice in Wonderland, or Murray Bauman (funny conspiracy theory guy) from Stranger Things, and you got my type.

But my fashion sense is definitely ESFP. You guys kill it when it comes to showing flair and I dig it.

So INFJs love us. INTPs either are annoyed by us, or like our more extroverted nature that we struggle with. INTJs look at us with some sense of amusement, or as time wasting clowns who are unproductive, and that ideas are good as long as they can be implemented (I can't argue with that).

So what do you ESFPs think about us?

Now once again I want to make a distinction between Type 7, Type 8, and Type 5 which are the most common types:

Type 5- Slightly more introverted ENTP. Focused on getting to the bottom of an idea as opposed to generating more ideas. Appears very calm and collected. Lots of sarcasm and dry wit- clever and witty when it counts. James Bond-ish subtlety in humor. More philosophical and introspective.

Does not debate as much as Type 7. Sees it mostly as a waste of time.

Type 7- Classic ENTP- spontaneous, energetic, full of ideas and loves creating ideas, loves to debate.

Type 8- Like a Type 7 but more assertive and bold. More strong-willed and direct. Doesn't take shit from anybody.",1611890622

Basiclly, all I wanted is to advise her, I noticed that she's easily offended, so kept my words for myself for a long time. 

Today she opened up again about it and complained from her partner's behaviors. she's fond of love affirmation, yet she doesn't get it, instead, she's being criticized. 

She accords complements to those around her &amp; talking about her complishments, I could tell she's totally grieving.

For me, that was unbearable, I wanted to make her life better so I opened up for my words, offering few solutions to make her reltionship work, while trying to convey a message of ""you've got some habits to be altered"", unintentionally, seems to be that I went quite inconsiderate, as a candid, critical &amp; spontaneous person, I didn't pay enough attention to what I'm saying until I was told all of a sudden ""you hurt me"" 

I literally just wanted to be helpful. I got enthusiastic about it, yet ruined it.

* Slow drivers

* Being talked at without any interest in my viewpoint. (Unhealthy ‚ÄúBlast‚Äù for any OPS people out there)

* tv shows or live sports that interrupt action to share sob stories, and then showing just brief highlights of the action. Ninja Warrior and the Olympics , for example 

* Micromanagement of trivial things

* People who insist that my wife and I are crazy for not owning napkins (maybe have some control of how you eat? üòÜ)

* People diagonally and slowly crossing the street in parking lots without acknowledgement of your presence when you let them cross

* Cups or mugs (or anything really) right at the edge of a counter or table

* People who cough into their hands

* ‚ÄúFe‚Äù enthusiasm from people who are actually dying inside... just be real with me. 

* trying to pack sunglasses. Like... how? They always break.

* movies that are weird without any conclusion or point. I like weird... but ya gotta wrap that shit up somehow (here‚Äôs looking at you, Inception)

* cliques and group labels 

* over-apologizing

* prioritizing Mother‚Äôs and Father‚Äôs Days over basically anything (‚Äúyou can‚Äôt have your daughter‚Äôs party on her birthday weekend, it is Mother‚Äôs Day!‚Äù)

* social media political paragraphs and essays that are clearly just virtue signaling

ESFP,"So, as we know, ESFP's are kind of known for living in the moment, maybe even a little too much. I don't know if you guys feel this way, and it's kind of pathetic to admit, but my ""living in the present"" is very extreme. Particularly if I'm going through something regarding physical pain. 

Every time I'm sick, or feel unwell, or get hurt, I constantly have to repeat in my head ""There will be a time and a place when I won't feel like this"" over and over again, because it seems like an impossible task to comprehend the fact that this pain won't last forever. 

I know it sounds stupid, but it's genuinely what I do. It's not always a bad thing, when something good is happening, I'm truly just there soaking up every wonderful moment of whatever it is. It's just when it's something bad, my mind has a hard time realizing that this pain is only temporary.

ESFP,"I was thinking about this just now and curious about your view and experience. So for me, I was the youngest of three: INTP brother, INFP sister, and then me (ESFP). Me and my brother (the oldest) are about 10 days less than four years apart, so we were all very close growing up or at least spent a lot of time together. And my parents are ESTP (dad) and INFP (mom). 

Anyway, everyone in my family was always very pessimistic and negative thinking, always going to the worst case scenario and complaining constantly about every little thing, so I always felt like my role in the family was being the lighthearted, optimistic, bright side thinker. And it was mostly okay, but at times, I felt like there was always this pressure to be or at least look happy all the time that my siblings never had to experience. They definitely had other problems. My sister being the ‚Äúgood, sweet, well behaved child‚Äù and my brother being the ‚Äúsmart, good at and likes school child‚Äù. I think a different stress and pressure came with all these roles that the other two didn‚Äôt notice, realize, or experience. And it wasn‚Äôt like our parents or anyone forced us into these roles, we just fell into them (the classic trio: smart one, sweet one, funny one) because overall, it‚Äôs more about our own feelings about our role and place that other people may not understand how we felt our roles were or the limits we felt we had, whether rational or not.

Anyway, I was curious what your experiences were in this regard? I‚Äôm particularly interested in sibling dynamics, but if you‚Äôre an only child, I‚Äôm interested in your dynamic too as that‚Äôs something (as the youngest child) I‚Äôve never experienced and it‚Äôs hard to imagine what that would be like.",1611479199

ESFP,"Learning has always been a big part of my life. This has been true from several years and over time, I‚Äôve discovered that many of us approach study and learning in an ineffective way. Most of us read or make notes, but in my experience, the Active Recall technique is simply the most EFFICIENT way to retain information.

Active Recall is essentially a 2 step process

* Review whatever you‚Äôre learning: Take the time to study the materials
* Practice testing yourself to recall the information

In doing so, we switch from passive learning to actively trying to recall whatever we learned. This will help us move the information from our short-term memory to our long-term memory so that we can easily remember it.

I employ Active Recall by using methods like The Feynman Technique and Flashcards to test myself. I explain all of this in depth here - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHZ\_\_4JUd8g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHZ__4JUd8g)

I don‚Äôt think I have Fe because I‚Äôm not selfless but I also don‚Äôt always know what I want, I feel directionless a lot of the time.

A few example of the best and top ESFP Anime characters on the top of my head are Kuwabara from Yu Yu Hakusho, Brook from One Piece, Majin Buu from DBZ, Knuckle Bine from Hunter x Hunter, and know Ryuji from Persona 5 for video games.

My ESFP Anime Characters list last year:

But besides anime, what are some great fictional ESFP characters from Live Action series? Tell me a list of some great live action ones, western cartoons and movies and TV shows, and video games even is fine. Often times people get confused a lot between ENFPs and ESFPs and mix up characters a lot which causes debates like with the common ENFP shonen main characters. In my opinion lots of learning of the functions and behaviors I learned a lot of the differences between the two types so I trust my judgement on telling ENFP and ESFP characters apart. So I disagree with an opinion on this common confusion and think a ENFP character is getting confused as ESFP I'll share my opinion on it and explain there Ne and Si they use for evidence.

As a good example of my opinion on this for characters. I type Princess Jasmine ESFP from Alladin and I type Ariel ENFP from the Little Mermaid for instance and comparison there. Theres quite a lot ENFPs and NFs in Disney movies which fits the Disney magic vibe and idealism the company shows and imagination and so on. Most people know Disney's image and how it is so I don't need to explain this. As another example, I type Ty Lee ESFP from Avatar and type Aang ENFP for more contrast there. I type Simba ENFP, I type Goofy ESFP regular and from Kingdom Hearts as well. Kirishima is ESFP from My Hero Academia also.

ESFP,"I looked on PDB (personality-database) if there was any ESFP philosopher, but I didn't find any. Out of 525 people, 0 was ESFP - thats just shameless. I can't comprehend how no one of them is ESFP. I'm pretty sure there is a lot of mistype there. And I heavily believe that being a Se dom you're much more likely to be a philosopher than other types, because perceiving the space around you is your dominant function and that's one of the things that philosophy needs. You see the world around you and make conclusions. Then you use Fi (you can use Ti also, the discussion here is between perceiving functions, not judging functions) and see what is right and what is wrong based on your vision of the self. You can even see that a lot of ESFPs are ennegram type 7, and so what? Enneagram type 7 is part of the head triad, collaborating with 5 and 6. I see that there are a lot of philosophers ""being"" ne dom there, but what philosophy has to do with ne? Philosophy don't see possibilities or anything like this, it makes statements based on knowledge, proof and what is being perceived. That's a shame. Shame of that community being so biased to the point that there is NOT A SINGLE ONE ESFP on the philosophy category of that website. TOTAL SHAME. I'm an ESFP myself and I like philosophy a lot. I even consider myself a philosopher - even though I have no evidence or means and I haven't even done anything to contribute to it, I just believe that I am and that's what it is. I perceive the world and make judgments based on my codes.

ESFP,"Discovering your purpose can be a tricky thing. You don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre meant to be doing or how you can utilize your skills to bring value to others. So often we‚Äôre told that we should seek to find our passion and work at it. While this is true, there‚Äôs a little bit more to consider.

Pixar‚Äôs latest film Soul delves into concepts like the meaning of life or how to uncover one‚Äôs purpose. We are often conditioned to believe that we are meant to fulfill one purpose and stick with it for all eternity.

**Yet so many people struggle to find that spark or purpose and remain unfulfilled**

One of the things that I will take away from this film is the understanding that some of us may not necessarily need to find a spark that translates into a job or career. Sometimes it can be the simple things that fuel us like people around us or a pleasant breeze. We‚Äôre often lost and go into despair when we can‚Äôt achieve our wild ambitions or get that dream job, BUT what if once we realize that it hasn‚Äôt fixed everything.

This is exactly why this movie is exceptional case study on all of these concepts and helps us think a little differently about it. I do a deeper breakdown on it here - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnQtnJqIJIw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnQtnJqIJIw)

ESFP,"I was typed as definite ENFP but whenever I look at inferior functions, I deny it myself. It seems like instead of choosing what actually identifies with me the most, I choose the one that denies my typings.

I even deny it by ""I'm not an ENFP because I was in an undiscovered Ne grip (in ISJs) for 8 months when my classmate has known me for 8 months."" I know this is not very possible because I was feeling pretty good at those times.

And yes, I was typed by a classmate who is knowledgeable about MBTI and cognitive functions. I was even typed by cognitive functions. Anything other than Ne-dom was eliminated to the point of her being stunned when I claim that I'm not ENxP.

What are some signs that I'm not an ENFP?

HERE ARE MY REASONS:

INFP: I feel more like ENFP than INFP and inferior Si fits me better than inferior Te. But I still consider this because of my fear of being INFP stereotypes.

ESFP: Just inferior Ni reactions, not dominant Se.

ISxJ: ""Inferior Ne is common and boring so I must be that one as well"" mentality. Flashbacks can happen when I look at some objects. I get possibilities though.

ISxP: PoLR Ne doesn't fit me but why not? Maybe my Ne is Se-Ni!

ESFP,"I'll share a formal energetics assessment that I conducted on Donald Trump. And the personality profiling result is the following...

Donald Trump is a SEE/ESFP in reverse development with main enneagram 8w7. NiTe subego (channelling Ni inspirations with Te methodics) pushed by a submerged Se Base frame. Fi fixation.

IRL dimensionality of valued functions:4D Base: Se (submerged)3D Primary Auxiliary: Te (surfacing)2D Secondary Auxiliary: Ni (surfaced)1D Acting Suggestive: Fi (submerging)

On practical terms the resulting behaviour is an hybrid between SEE/ESFP and LIE/ENTJ. His strong tendencies of shaming and guilting others are an unhealthy expression of Fe Demonstrative. On top of that he has NPD.

Reversion is often triggered by trauma, depression and/or drug abuse. I suspect that in the case of Trump it was the latter to trigger the above reversion.

If you think that you can just cage the fluidity of human psyche in 16 boxes of stereotypes with all people following the same specific steps in development... And call it a day... You're delusional and you're vastly understimating the human psyche.

The human psyche is much more fluid and vast than systems like MBTI and socionics think it to be.

ESFP,"I believe ESFPs do not get enough love online, so I, an INFJ, am here to express my appreciation for them. (I only know two ESFPs in real life, one is my best girl friend and another is a older peer I really admire, so I have had positive experiences with this type).

1. I am just so IN LOVE with your go-getter attitude and work ethic.
- The ESFPs I know do not wait for good things to come to them, they work and grind for what they want. Whether it's for their dream grad school, their dream job, or someone they want to be with, they make concrete steps in moment to push themselves closer to that goal.

2. You guys are such a joy and wild child at parties and in general
- The stereotype is that ESFPs are partiers, but it's not emphasized enough how TRULY fun they are when it's time to let loose. As an introvert, I really loved having a friend that I could go out with and feel comfortable to go wild with. They're great dancers and singers, and generally know how to have a good time and a few laughs.

3. Great listeners!
- If you're in a conversation with an ESFP, they hear and actively listen to what you say. I always felt heard, and comfortable talking to them, because I know they will actually consider what I say.

4. Underrated wisdom and advice
- That said, I feel ESFPs are underrated with how actually wise they are. Sure in some situations, they may screw up a bit or not really see the underlying issue. But for an INFJ, their take-aways on life and their own philosophies are extremely beneficial to anxious and melancholic Ni Doms.

5. Amazing style and eye for aesthetics
- Fashion icons, great taste, modern but not boring

6. Great bodies and admirable commitment to exercise
- Only reason I am comfortable enough messing around in the gym is because of my ESFP best friend. Pushed me to stick to a routine, look exercises up, and in general just have fun with moving.

7. Extremely smart and competent at their field of choice
- Also not talked about enough, but the ESFPs I know are /experts/ at in what they choose to do. They have a structured knowledge on the subject, and are able to act from there. On top of their consistent energy for work, there is not much they cannot do.

8. Surprisingly non-conventional
- I feel almost guilty for thinking this, but at first glance I judged them to be very basic. But just because they were very peppy and knew how to navigate people/life, does not mean they are any less unique. Their interests and life paths are not so typical, and they have a very unique mind.

9. EXTREMELY loyal to their family, close friends, and significant other
- ESFPs get a lot of flack for cheating and being drawn to others because they're just so attractive and smooth, but these people are COMMITTED when they're committed. They also stand by their closest friends, and stick to their families.

10. Literally the most generous people
- I am always eating, wearing, or using things my ESFPs have offered to me. They never see it as transactional, its just generosity for generosity's sake.

11. Unexpectedly amazing leaders for their communities
- When their people skills are combined with their knowledge on how things work, they are able to guide, lead, and organize the general public for greater goals.

12. Very relaxed about differences
- Literally so chill about other people's quirks, unless it crosses a boundary or value they hold close to their heart

13. Exceptionally observant
- Ni Doms SUCK at this so much, idk why it's a stereotype that INFJs can read people well (maybe if we know the person or place like the back of our hand). But ESFPs are so skilled at noting tiny variations in a person's behavior, able to read if they're angry, nervous, or in love. It's always my ESFP that's reading me or reading for me.

14. Very confident, yet humble and modest
- They know they're worth and they are not afraid to work for what they want, but they never have an air of arrogance or excessive pride.

15. Just great people overall
- Happy or sad, rain or shine, just wonderful people to hang out and bond with. Good vibes and great friends only gang :)",1609796359

ESFP,"Any other Esfps counter-dependent? 


‚ÄúIf there was a mantra that all counterdependents have, it would probably be ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need anyone.‚Äù

The signs of counterdependency

Counterdependents can often come across as vibrant, ‚Äòlife of the party‚Äô sorts, or be the kind who have many friends and relationships. The difference is that those relationships will not be deep and trusting, and might not last.

So one of the main signs of counterdependency is an inability to have connected and authentic relationships. This involves:

-seeming good at relating but then having a ‚Äòpoint‚Äô or ‚Äòwall‚Äô where it stops
-feeling ‚Äòtrapped‚Äô in relationships
-pushing people away or going cold without warning
-fear of abandonment or rejection (so abandon or reject first)‚Äù

what personality type am I? i think i am either enfp or esfp.

I'm an ambivert. some days I am extremely social and am with people as much as I can and other days I sit by myself for many days playing guitar. but I want to say that I am a more extrovert than an introvert.

I am a very creative and an artistic person who can suddenly resort to singing

at school I get pretty good grades but get the worst in order and behavior. I wander, swear in class and do not stop talking in class. so I never really cared much about rules. I follow my own rules about what is immoral and moral.

I am a very sensitive person and am not so logical of myself. and i am a very spontaneous person i tend to do things without thinking about things. once I went far out into the wilderness with a friend of mine and survived without anything I had brought from home.

Hi, I'm taken such a personality test a couple of times. then I got infp, enfp and esfp.

I am a very creative person who loves people. I love to make people laugh. but I also like to be for myself. so I will say I am an ambivert.

I have mostly received enfp but do not feel I fit an enfp. i think i'm more of an infp or esfp. is in a way a mixture.

at school I have many friends but do not do so well at school. the school system somehow does not quite suit me. and I love and tend to push the boundaries and talk in class and stuff until I get thrown in the hallway or get detention.

I am a very sympathetic person and a very sensitive boy. who always thinks of others before I think of myself.

I am also very spontaneous and rarely or almost never think about things.

I love to think deeply and listen to the poetry poems of Jim Morrison. but it's a secret because i'm a coward to be afraid of getting what others think about me.

on weekdays I spend a lot of time with friends but on weekends and holidays I tend to sit inside playing guitar and write my own songs. but to go to party once in a while but it does not happen so often.

ESFP," This girl is very popular in school, due to being pretty, laidback, genuine, and kind (well, she can be a tad bit judgmental, but is generally nice.) She is open, down to earth, humble, and relatable, and comes off as ‚Äúcool‚Äù (this is how many of her peers would describe her.) She can actually be a bit socially awkward from time to time, but she is very good at saving herself/saving the moment from being too awkward when this does happen, typically by making a joke. Her peers often remark that she has the ‚Äúit factor‚Äù and that they can envision her becoming famous. She‚Äôs actually pretty quiet and reserved a good amount of time ‚Äì she is not particularly loud, but people are drawn to her due to her beauty and she does have a great personality. She tends to make friends even though she sometimes does not speak a ton. She is willing to approach people and tends to meet more people through friends she has already made‚Ä¶ she always needs time to go home, relax, and reflect at the end of the day. She finds it particularly important to have time to herself to relax, even though she can be ambitious and does have a work ethic. She has a large number of social media followers, and enjoys posing for pictures and taking pictures of herself.

She is noted by her peers for her fashion sense...she has her own personal style, and yet is very stylish/has great fashion sense. She is a trendsetter at school amongst her peers, and pulls together great outfits. She is also conventionally attractive in general (she would still be considered pretty without makeup due to the way her face comes together, but is also well-groomed and has figured out which makeup tricks specifically help enhance her facial features and make her look better.) She does focus on her physical appearance, as looking good helps her feel better about herself, and her mother has been clear with her about the Halo Effect being particularly applicable in regards to women ‚Äì she is aware that those around her treat her better because she looks good, and knows that she will one day lose her looks and youth, which is partly why she ensures that she is enjoying herself. She always shows up to school and public events with a stylish outfit, and generally looking physically appealing, as it greatly boosts her confidence. She lives in the present more than anything, though she does sometimes sit and think about the past when reflecting, and absolutely thinks about the future, and where she imagines something going, though she is primarily focused on relaxing/living in the moment and notices current trends (though she is the one who typically sets the trends ‚Äì she is good at envisioning where something will go.) She is quick to notice a change in physical appearance in someone else, or physical details (for example, she will compliment someone on a new outfit, notices when someone has changed their beard or eyebrows, etc.)

She struggled with confidence issues/low self-esteem and shyness when she was a bit younger, much like her little brother is now, but she grew to be more confident during her later years of elementary school and realized that she needed to maintain a certain level of self-respect in order to avoid being bullied/put down by others, and that she would truly feel happy and fulfilled if she were able to start thinking more about her positive traits and stop being bothered by what she was unable to fix. She is not as naturally driven as her older brother is in regards to taking a ton of advanced placement classes and being an overachiever, although she maintain a good GPA/good grades in school, as she does listen to her mother and is aware that college is becoming more and more competitive. She does not know what she wants to do with her life, though she is not bothered by this, as she knows that she will eventually figure things out, and in the meantime prefers to chill out with friends and enjoy living her life. She can struggle with completing her assignments on time, even though she is smart and does usually understand the work - her mother typically helps her out with this. She knows what her flaws are in regards to her appearance, and in general, though either jokes about them or works on herself.

TL;Dr: This girl is popular in school due to being pretty (she is aware of this, but makes sure to look good primarily for herself,) laidback, relatable, kind, being a trendsetter fashion-wise, and having ""personality."" She notices physical changes in others and lives in the moment, but can think about the past and/or future when reflecting, and is able to know/guess where something is going... she struggled with confidence/self-esteem issues but worked on her confidence as she realized that it would help her feel happier/better about herself, and maintains good grades in school even though she can struggle with completing assignments on time. Jokes about flaws, or works on herself.

We‚Äôre described as always having fun, maybe even too much fun, so I‚Äôd think most would assume we have little self awareness. But I find myself much more self aware than others.

I already posted the same text on ESTP Teddit but I would really appreciate it, if you can spend some time reading random facts about me and say of it sounds like you. Thanks in advance üòä‚ô• 
Oh and sorry for any mistakes, english isn't my first language 

- I am a very open person, make friends very easily, can socialise with everyone, but prefer to talk to my friends at parties because all smalltalks are the same and dumb


- I am a very emotional and sensitive person, but I don't like to talk about my feelings, I keep my face in public

 
- I am not very empathic, it's difficult for me to provide emotional support cause I prefer to solve the problem instead. But I cry watching almost every movie because of the sad music or I can cry because my new plant is dead. 


- I hate people who have to think for too long while deciding on smth, to discuss the same thing over and over again, cause I prefer to quickly make a decision and act and I don't care if this is the best one or not


- I am impatient and restless, if I doesn't understand something right away, then I drop the case. Especially if it's about understanding some complicated theories (I work in sciences so I have to read a lot of theoretical stuff) 
 

- I am good at solving problems of other people, I can remain calm in a stressful situation


- I can be rude unconsciously, I try to act friendly and nice towards everyone but it happens sometimes. If I know that I have offended someone, this worries me a lot (exception: I don't like this person, then I don't care lol) 


- My opinion about my own morality depends on someone else's assessment, if I receive negative feedback and criticism, I consider myself as a bad person and can fall into tears. It's also very easy to manipulate me by making me feel bad, it's hard to say ""no"" in that cases


- I can't stand people trying to show how special and individualistic they are.  
 

- I try to be tolerant and accept any point of view, even if it contradicts my principles and logic.  I think that everything on this planet is very subjective, so even if something is the dumbest thing in my eyes, everyone has a right on their own opinion


- But this doesn't stop me from provoking  discussions just by taking sides with some very controversial opinions. I just enjoy arguing (although I am not good at it and I am a bad looser who gets emotional) 
 


- I don't believe in mysticism and spiritual things, but I think a lot about the meaning of life and purpose of humanity



- I dislike breaking rules and make sure others don't break them too



- I am NOT into any sports, it's just too exhausting. I don't like risks and anything ""extreme"". But I enjoy playing guitar and have many handcrafting hobbies

- Sometimes (and mainly on the internet) I like to pretend I am dumb cute fairy girl just to be liked üßö‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",1609275148

I figured I was an ESFP because I've always been the funny friend with entertaining stories from when I was younger and even when talking about dark things from the past I manage to make it funny naturally. I love talking in front of people and being the center of attention with making people happy. I love making sure everyone is included and having a great time.

ESFP,"Hey! Sorry if these questions have been answered a thousand times, I'm fairly new to mbti and haven't engaged much with the community. I know that 16p mistypes people often but I'm not that deep to know which types and to what so I'm wondering if ESFPs getting ENFP is a common occurrence.

The thing is I'm trying to type my sister who had only really taken 16p before (several times, always the same result, ENFP) and just trusted it as the description there seemed to fit her. However, I had my suspicions she had been mistyped because I thought she was too down to earth and practical to be an intuitive, so I helped her figure out her type through the cognitive functions instead. 

Turns out she's probably an ESFP, with the most defining factor being that her Se is pretty strong as opposed to Si. For example, she's very good at noticing details in her environment and reading people. Besides, she admitted to not feel very strongly towards Ne, even if Ni didn't cause much of a reaction either (which, if it's used as an inferior function, could make sense)

The problem is that she doesn't relate as much to most ESFP definitions because they seem ""too exaggerated"" for her, especially the part about being super outgoing, fun-loving and such. I still think she might be one and that her reluctance is due to the fact that she's actually a bit of an ambivert and almost shy. Any ESFP here feels the same way? Most of the other stuff is spot on for her, but a lot of ExFP characteristics are similar so it could go both ways tbh.

The second part of the question is that I couldn't help but notice that ESFPs and INTPs (my own type) are pretty much opposites when it comes to functions and I found it really amusing. I always thought we get along pretty well despite our differences in key moments (maybe she gets irritated when I get too logical or sidetracked, maybe I find her too impulsive sometimes, that's about all of it), but I assume it's a tough combination when it doesn't involve people literally raised together.

In many ways, we‚Äôve been programmed to believe that happiness and satisfaction will be ours once we climb up that next rung of the corporate or success ladder. We‚Äôre always striving for more and sacrifice so much in hopes of being happy in the future.

ESFP,"What is self-actualization? The dictionary defines it as the full development of one‚Äôs abilities and potential. I like to think of it as getting closer to a purpose driven and intentional existence. Maslow‚Äôs Hierarchy of Needs is an age-old psychology theory about motivation and describes how to achieve self-actualization.

It‚Äôs commonly depicted as a 5-tier pyramid with the follow levels:

1. Physiological Needs
2. Safety Needs
3. Love &amp; Belonging Needs
4. Self-Esteem Needs
5. Self-Actualization

This model explains that each of these needs must be progressively met before reaching self-actualization, but through my own experimentation, I‚Äôve found that there is much more of an overlap with each of them. We each hold different values and expectations of ourselves, and so our version of actualization varies greatly. I describe the theory in greater depth and use my own experimentation to explain this further here. Definitely check it out. - [https://youtu.be/ApVoMsacKyk](https://youtu.be/ApVoMsacKyk)

One was creating a discord server with all 16 types (my own idea and I've not seen somebody else do this before me)

Create a youtube channel with either all XNTX types or to be different all XNXP types. 

So I just have this thought what if we combine them and have a youtube channel with 16 types. This would mean a balanced perspective from all the types. Types like ESTJ ISTJ  and ESFP will achually get recognised for once as most mbti YouTube channels are just run by INXP or INXJs or at most ENXPs. 

It will be intresting to see how the 16 types work together setting up the foundations off the channel 

Different types will take on different role while setting it up. This dosnt mean IXFP cant be a leader or a Perciever can organise the channel but I think there are different roles that will suit different type better. 

All types will be on at some point especially when we are making a video about that specific type or that group off type however only some not sure how many will for videos not related for a certain type. 

We will probably have a discord invent new typing methods and build a website in the future

Sorry about my English in advance.

So, I recently started a relationship with this amazing girl and I am starting to see another version of me; a more emotional one. I know that that is not the only difference between ESTP's and ESFP's, but I feel different, to be honest. And it made me think a lot about my personality. A teacher at my university has told me that I might be an ESTP and she made me do the test. I feel like I answered the questions with the goal of getting ESTP as a result, which I did, multiple times. But It's like I am wearing this mask of someone I am not if that makes any sense? 

I am well known as that happy guy that jumps around energetic as hell; as someone who never cries. I can relate to a lot of things about the ESTP, but some things like partying, being a walking chad, and things about being really cold, that I cannot relate to. My mood can switch quickly, if someone said something mean I cannot concentrate on other things that well, and I can lay down in bed thinking about things I could've done or said.

So long story short, I did the test again and answered every question truthfully. And I got ESFP as a result. Would you guys be so kind and help me out a little bit? It's really important for me to know which one I might be, so that I can work on myself.

She was also lazy; she enjoyed having fun, never did chores, and never studied for tests in school but she did pay careful attention to whatever was being taught and always did well. She was rebellious, doing things like stealing fruits from neighbors and sneaking out of the home to hang out with friends.

¬∑ Friendly, charming, easygoing, energetic, funny, playful, cheerful, childish, outgoing, flamboyant, positive, and far from a serious person

¬∑ A few things she judges and hates most in people are those who are lazy and weak. She often says she can‚Äôt stand pushovers because people should just be straight-up about things they don‚Äôt like. 

¬∑ She‚Äôs good with her hands and has a lot of skills in things like sewing and cooking. She‚Äôs also really quick to spot things in the environment like finding our parked car.

¬∑ She‚Äôs very fickle; she always changes her mind especially at the last second, can‚Äôt commit, changes jobs every few weeks to months, and makes spontaneous decisions like randomly buying plane tickets to visit her home country for vacation. 

¬∑ Strong, aggressive to get what she wants, and confrontational. When she wants something, she‚Äôll be determined to go after it. She‚Äôs also not one to give up easily and when someone does something she disagrees with or crosses her, she‚Äôll always confront them. 

¬∑ Can get competitive when gaming, is independent, and loves being the leader or the one in charge. She‚Äôs in charge of my dad and she cut ties with another friend when she was young because they both wanted to be in charge of each other. 

¬∑ Enjoys learning about health, finances, and investments. She reads a lot of health books and listens to podcasts educating people about improving their finances and basically how to be money smart. 

¬∑ Confident, stubborn, and opinionated. She always thinks she‚Äôs right even if evidence is presented to her that claims otherwise. She still disagrees and refuses to budge because she believes she‚Äôs right from ‚Äúher own logic‚Äù. She also jumps to conclusions quickly.

¬∑ She‚Äôs saving with money because she stresses the importance of having to save for the future and for emergency situations. Financial security is important to her. She always talks about how her children must plan for their future to be successful.

¬∑ Despite telling children they have to plan for their future, she‚Äôs not much of a planner herself. 

¬∑ She doesn‚Äôt typically follow rules and prefers to do things her own way. Even with cooking, she doesn‚Äôt listen to recipes even though she enjoys cooking up new dishes. She never gives an estimate of time because she claims ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no such time‚Äù and she enjoys making things by her own ‚Äúideas‚Äù.

¬∑ She doesn‚Äôt care much to tell other people what to do; however, she‚Äôs extremely controlling when it comes to her children and has an issue if they don‚Äôt do things her way.

¬∑ Tends to do things really quickly, is impatient, always loses family‚Äôs possessions, and frequently misplaces items. 

¬∑ Can be quite insensitive and blunt. She‚Äôs also not understanding of people who are driven by emotions and can‚Äôt relate to them.

¬∑ Although she can‚Äôt stand people who do things using their emotions, she can also be dramatic. When angry, she has claimed things like how she‚Äôs going to fly away from the country, divorce our dad, never speak to someone again, etc. She also once sold the family business during an argument with our dad because he dared her to, thinking she wasn‚Äôt bold enough to actually do it.

¬∑ Can be lazy to start a task but refuses to take a break when she‚Äôs in the middle of a task because once she starts, she can‚Äôt stop even if that means she‚Äôs getting tired

¬∑ Some of her hobbies include cooking, watching dramas and comedies, grocery shopping, trying out new recipes, singing, and competitive gaming.",1608194288

ESFP guy and I have been dating for 1.5 years.  His last relationship ended 3 years ago and had lasted 6 years.  

There are a few things I know about his ex, one being that she has a French Bulldog.  

Every month or so for this 1.5 years he has mentioned or suggested that I get a dog and has often said it should be a French Bulldog.  Every time I would say something like, ""Now's not the right time"" but I would **think**, ""Why the heck would I get the exact same dog that your ex has? That's weird!  Why would you even want me to get the same type of dog she has?""

Yesterday, he mentioned again that I should get a French Bulldog.  I straight up looked at him and said, ""You want me to get the exact same dog that you ex has?""  and he looked at me and I saw dawning in his eyes.  He responded, ""Yikes!  You should definitely NOT get a French Bulldog, that would be SOOOO weird!  It never crossed my mind when I suggested it.  Yeah, don't.""

ESFP,"I‚Äôve never been someone who could just sit still for an extended period of time, let alone clear my mind and be present.

I did not, however, expect it to improve my productivity and focus the way it did‚Ä¶

As a newbie, I used guided meditation sessions on a bunch of different apps. This REALLY HELPS because you‚Äôre having someone hold your hand through what can be a truly noisy initial few sessions if done on your own. Some of the apps include Headspace, Calm and Waking Up with Sam Harris.

I‚Äôve also learned to just sit comfortably and focus on my breathing. All of this has given me a sense of calmness that is pretty hard to describe. I go in depth on my experiment here and break down my journey - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHeyAKUwd-o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHeyAKUwd-o)

ESFP,"So I‚Äôm wondering if y‚Äôall can relate. I started to think about this a lot since getting out of an unhealthy relationship. So I care a lot about how I look (maybe too much sometimes) and naturally put a lot of effort into my image. Beauty and aesthetics have always been very important to me, which I‚Äôm sure y‚Äôall can understand! Anyway, I do want people to be attracted to me physically, appreciate my style, etc. However, when I start to hear too much of the same message, it starts to give me anxiety that people are only valuing me on a surface level. 

My ex and I were dating long distance for 8 months. When visiting her, I was continuing to be introduced to more and more of her friends. This was interesting. Nothing ever went too deep with them, but our conversations were engaging, and I always felt like I‚Äôd made a good impression. Long story short, while texting my ex one night, she told me that her friends had been calling me ‚Äúhot (my name)‚Äù, which she apparently had no involvement in. My ex would also compliment me a lot on my looks, very seldom about my character. I guess I can understand the frustrations of girls getting cat called, because I‚Äôve had people stop me in the grocery store to let me know their thoughts about my body, call out to me while on a run, and even have my sister‚Äôs friend climb into bed with me without me asking. 

I know ESFPs are sometimes called the attractive type, and I get it, but I‚Äôm starting to get so sick of the superficiality. Am I the only one who struggles with this? Getting sick of feeling used by people.",1607667579

I've decided to create this survey out of pure fun and inquisitiveness because I've been curious to know whether there are correlations between MBTI type and sexuality, particularly with sexual preferences and attitudes toward sex.

ESFP,"I‚Äôve struggled with finding consistency in my productivity for the longest time. Over time, I‚Äôve learned that consistency is best found through a simple, well-designed routine. There are very few consistency techniques as effective as the 15 Minute Routine. It‚Äôs essentially a 3-step process that basically looks like this:

1. At the beginning of each day, set a fixed amount of time you can dedicate to your work
2. Set a goal for your progress in 15 minute increments
3. If you complete your task ahead of schedule, move on to the next task until your total time runs out.

So often we set huge milestones and large timeframes, when instead a small (15 minute) window can push us work harder and faster. This technique also keeps you driven when you see the progress that you‚Äôve made in that small window.

For me, he has played a big part in pushing me to go all in on discovering and pursuing my purpose.

Now, you might be able to see any of his many inspirational videos on his Instagram, but 2 of the lessons that I learnt from him are:

* Remember the hard times (Those are the memories that will push you to work harder to avoid the hardships that you‚Äôve previously been through)
* Operate with your back up against the wall (This will drive you to keep finding solutions and doing whatever you can to keep making progress)

ESFP,"¬∑ Very rebellious: she has brake checked a police officer who tail gated her, chased after an armed robber with a stun gun, cut a stranger‚Äôs cord because they refused to leave after closing while charging their phone, intentionally put multiple shots of caffeine into a customer‚Äôs decaf order for being a Trump supporter, disobey parents, has homewrecked a relationship, uses her boyfriend‚Äôs credit card without permission, has used a customer‚Äôs groupon without permission, etc.

¬∑ When she homewrecked a girl‚Äôs relationship, the girl confronted her which caused my sister to hate the girl and want to get revenge on her. I believe she was envious of the girl since she spent a long time lurking on her and even created a catfish profile of the girl years later as a way to get her real Instagram deleted.

¬∑ She went through a phase when she was 14 to 15 where she wrote a lot on Tumblr expressing her emotions, mainly about love. There were many posts where she wrote about crying in the shower, heartbreak, getting her trust broken, never being able to get over a breakup, wanting to get into an accident in order to erase all bad memories, being tired of everyone and everything, people not caring about her, wanting to find happiness, giving up, how she cares too much, etc.

¬∑ She still goes through random moments of feeling these emotions at times, but to a much lesser extent compared to when she was a teenager since she‚Äôs now in her early 20s. Nowadays, she‚Äôs more temperamental or gives no fucks.

¬∑ Has a history of losing friends and arguing with family members, especially parents. Our parents have an issue with her because she doesn‚Äôt get good grades, skipped school a lot, never meet their expectations, and don‚Äôt really listen to them.

¬∑ School was never her thing because she always got poor grades. She dropped out of college and decided to become a lash technician instead. She self-admitted to being a lazy, sloppy person.

¬∑ Often she bottles up stress and anger and the result is her being tired of everything. She says venting can‚Äôt recover a person, so she sometimes feels like packing her shit and leaving without saying a word because she just wants to get out.

¬∑ Not sure if she has the same fear now, but when she was younger, she was afraid to love because she feared getting hurt and she has high expectations of relationships because of movies. Her fear of getting hurt extended beyond romantic relationships; she also feared getting hurt by friends and family.

ESFP,"So I've done the iq test twice, all formal and proctored. (In my school) The first one was when I was at 5th grade, I don't exactly remember the score but it categorised me into ""slow learner"" then the second one i took at 7th grade, i think i got 87 on that one, and categorised into ""low average"". I looked up the definition of slow learner and it's basically everyone with an iq of 80-90 (dumb, but not dumb enough for mental retardation) ... I am always bad ah stuff like maths.. from 7th to 12th grade math was the hardest shit i know of. I remember leaving the tests blank and got 7/40 questions right on the finals. It never clicked.. I remember getting bullied at 7th grade for being slow and dumb by the smart kids. i was extremely passive at school and had no interest in anything academic. I always rank last each year in terms of overall report card score.  At 8th grade people criticised me for being obnoxious and cheesy... But at that point i was trying to regain my social life after a year of being bullied/as the recluse.  I didn't know how to behave. I remained a recluse after that until 12th grade. Some infp decided to be my pity friend but even he got tired of me being too loud , unfocused, obnoxious, and distracting. He even told me i was trashy. I was merely trying to be sociable, by incorporating trends and pop culture into my persona.  He left me and now i have no friends. I also tried chatting with the opposite sex but the entire class reported me to the school council for ""harassing  them"" all i did was chat with them frequently.... Cuz i wanted to regain the social warmth i had lost. 
Im fuckin ugly also. Everybody rates me as 3/10.
My mum thinks im smart but sadly she just doesn't know how much i struggle in school. She told me that its ok to be ugly as long you're smart......cuz then you will make more money and money is the only thing that matters! Unfortunately i dont see how a dumb, socially inept, ditzy me can be successful in life.

ESFP,"Making tough decisions has never been something that just came naturally to me. I kept finding myself deliberating over all of my options and spending far too long on a problem before I decided what to do with it. This all changed when I started implement The OODA Loop technique created by Military strategist CL.John Boyd.

The OODA Loop is essentially a 4-step linear cycle

* Observe: The part where you ingest all the information you need
* Orient: The part where you process all of that information
* Decide: The part where you‚Ä¶um‚Ä¶decide
* Act: The part where you follow through on your decision.

I‚Äôve learnt that this cycle has helped me lessen the time that I take on my decisions and learn from any mistakes so that it keeps getting better over time. That‚Äôs why Act isn‚Äôt the final step, but is simply a part of the cycle.

More than anything, it‚Äôs made me realize that we‚Äôll never really have all the information that we need for a decision, and being comfortable with taking a call amidst uncertainty. I explain this is great depth here - [https://youtu.be/paQZjrzqKd8](https://youtu.be/paQZjrzqKd8)

Curious to know what other ESFPs are anxious about (in general or right now) and the connection it has to our cognitive functions.

Being stuck inside all day without the option to GO destroys my soul and makes me feel like my strengths and enjoyment of life are under threat or not being used.

The Rule of Three is exceptional productivity hack for living and working with more intention. It basically required you to list out three wins that you want to have

* Every day
* Every week
* Every year

When you set the milestones that you want to achieve for each of these timelines, you become much more mindful of whether the things that you are doing are actually going to lead you to your goals. I‚Äôve found that my short term and long term goals make a lot more sense and line up a lot more now.

ESFP,"I‚Äôd been feeling fairly stuck with my personal growth and development until I came across this pretty simple concept called the Marginal Gains Theory. The principle behind this theory is that all successful people consistently strive to make small 1% improvements to whatever they‚Äôre working on, every day.

The Marginal Gains Theory can be traced back to the 2003 British Cycling team. New performance director Dave Brailsford wanted to create a championship winning team and began to make 1% improvements from the mechanics of the bike to the diet of the riders to the training schedules. Ultimately, the British Cycling team ended up becoming the most dominant team in the history of the sport.

This is true for anyone who is striving to achieve a degree of success. Small, steady 1% improvements over time will eventually compound and set you apart from the rest of your peers. The same is true for marginal losses which can lead to great failure.

I highly recommend you try out this practice. I explain this further here - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUttbcVanw4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUttbcVanw4)

However, there came a point where I felt he wasn‚Äôt being genuine or honest once I found out some things he was hiding - which for myself, ISTP is where a person starts messing with my freedom/autonomy because I take that as manipulating information to alter my choice - altering my freedom. I will respect and accept you - but don‚Äôt try to game me. 

At this point, I bailed. His behavior became a bit cold to me.

ESFP,"Productivity can often be over complicated. When in fact, the most efficient productivity approaches are super simple. There are very few methods as simple and effective as the Ivy Lee Method, which is over 100 years old. It‚Äôs essentially a 5 step process that looks like this:

1. At the end of each day, write down the 6 most important things you need to accomplish tomorrow
2. Prioritize the 6 items in order of true importance
3. The next day, concentrate only on the first task until completed. Then, move the next task.
4. Work your way through your list. Any unfinished items move on to the next day with a new list of 6 tasks.
5. Repeat this process each working day

So often our propensity for following some elaborate technique can inhibit our ability to be truly productive. This method simply relies on creating a to-do list with a fixed number of items and approaching it in a smart way.

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, I really screwed over this ESFP sugar baby I met. We hung out twice and hooked up both times. The sex (I have to compliment you ESFPs, tip of my hat too) was phenomenal, and she even said it was one of the best of her life.  


&amp;#x200B;

I got mad/anxious when she didn't respond to my texts so I threatened to tell her super conservative/religious family what she does for money. She freaked out and begged me not to, and we talked on the phone from around midnight to 6am while she was crying, but I had assured her I wouldn't do what I threatened.  Couple days later, I ask to see her, and she was being really paranoid and asking me why she could trust meeting me and how she could know I wasn't going to kill her. I was so shocked because I obviously don't want to physically hurt her, but I didn't know what to say, and just got angry again. I stupidly made the same threat to contact her parents and she ended up telling them herself. After that she threatened to call the police etc. and since then I've pretty much left her alone.

&amp;#x200B;

I've sent her a long apology text but she again told me to leave her and anyone she knows alone. But she didn't block my number though (still able to send her iMessage texts, they would turn green if she blocked me).

 Is it just me or do you guys also get hurt when someone doesn't take you up on your help?

ESFP,"I‚Äôve been feeling like I‚Äôve had been falling prey to procrastination so much more than I would like until I came across this extremely practical concept called the 2 Minute Rule. No matter what‚Äôs going on in your day, if there is a habit that you are trying to stick to, you need to have a 2 minute version of it that you can rely on.

The 2 Minute Rule was first mentioned in David Allen‚Äôs legendary book Getting Things Done and then popularized by James Clear, who wrote Atomic Habits. It‚Äôs perhaps the most realistic hack to managing habits that I‚Äôve come across.

For every positive activity that you are doing, try to have a 2 minute version of it.

* Exercising: My 2 Minute Version would be 20 pushups and 20 setups
* Writing: My 2 Minute Version would be opening up my laptop and writing one new sentence
* Reading: My 2 Minute Version would be reading just one more page before bed

I highly recommend you try this out. I explain this further here - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq2dQyTlyYk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq2dQyTlyYk)

ESFP,"No matter how I looked at my past, there Always was in me this deep hate for the utter simpleness of my peers hapiness. They could laugh 10 min and make jokes about how the teacher missed 1 stair  going to class. 

And I was Always cynical about it. There was Always this voice saying : ""That's so stupid, it's not even funny and it's been 10minute. STFU already and work on your exercizes or you'll complain again how you didn't passed but spent all class laughing about a stupid joke"".

I refused to be happy because I thought it would make me stupid. And yes I wasn't, I was Always a Straight A student. But I became bitter about people over time, bitter at how happy they were and how little they did to improve when I percieved myself as being the ""hero"" by ""sacrificing"" his happiness to be the best. I was a hard working person taking pride in my results but also in my .... unhappiness ??? 

I was happy that I wasn't happy because I made the association that being unhappy was a sign of hard work. Hard working people are working this hard because they're unhappy about their situation and doing everything they Can to better it. I assumed that because when people's life is on the Line they took thing more seriously, I should engineer my life to make it seem like m'y life was on the line 24/7 and work as hard as I could to better my situation.

This came from a lot of observations of my peers. In fact I realized that most straight A students were like me. They weren't happy in the now but planning their life overtime and making sacrifices. The only difference is that they took it to a bearable level, when I was applying to basically all my life. I had so much hatred and jealousy I guess. So much anger that everyone around me was happy but I wasn't. So angry that even thought I was working my hardest, life didn't improve. In fact it was getting worse and worse over time.

I was an anti-conformists and had so much anger that I was scared by myself. I treated myself badly for wanting happiness and I was highly judgemental. On the outside I was just a cool dude very laid back who wasn't very demanding about friendship. I appeared wise and deep and smart on first looks. Someone with his priorities in life who's very reliable, not emotionaly draining, chill. But when people were getting closer to me, they started to realize that it wasn't the case, it was all appearance, but I was clueless like they were, if not more clueless than them.

When I realized that friendship led to delusion I refused to socialize, refusing to let people get close to me. I wanted to maintain this appearance of thoughtfullness because it flattered my ego. For once I was recognized for my smartness, my knowledge. Even thought I had the emotional maturity of a toddler from not socializing and refusing hapiness.

People came to me because I seemed happy, seemed like I had it all figured it out and I could maybe share my secret to find personal happiness. And I took pride in it so I entertained the myth. But this kept me from actually wisening up. Having my opinions changed and experiecing life. I was coming from a position of superiority when I was equal to my peers.

Eventually, my peers experienced life when I was pretending, and now I'm too ashamed to admit that I was the stupid one all along.
So I bottle up untill I Land my master's degree  and leave the house and the close Friends and go on vacations to catch up. Allow myself to be happy for once and Come back energized and enthusiastic with ""true"" life experiences.

This realization was made thanks to my ESFP friend. Because ESFP place a lot of importance on protecting ""good vibes"". 

ESFP's friend sayings :
Treating yourself badly will make you treat people close to you badly.

You're more likely to treat yourself badly when you're in a Bad place. Thus you're more likely to be an asshole toward close people when in a Bad place.

TL;DR : Be happy and you'll be naturally be nice to everyone around you. You won't expect a dime from your kind gestures and people will love how good you are to them. With one exception for love, were your SO's happiness is more important than yours.


when I was in this phase i Saw it as a threat to my work ethics, but didn't realized at the Time that it made me bitter and a Bad person. Didn't made me realize that I was becoming an asshole and snobby to my Friends (except him whom I Always kept in high regards. I Always felt like his equal so my attitude never took a toll on our relationships thankfully)

I didn't realized that it kept me from experiencing love with the opposite sex and to experience life. I thought it was a necessary sacrifice but it wasn't.

I think a good explanation behind it was my upbringing. I was brought by muslims parents with 80% of Muslim Friends. I went to Muslim School from 6 to 16 years old, do the ramadan and went to mosquee every friday. I was CONSTANTLY told that everything we do in this World will have an impact on our futur life. Wether we will go to heaven or hell. We should Always think about next life and keep ourselves from temporary pleasures (sins on earth) to find eternal happiness in heaven. We never really talked about it because our Muslim School was mixed, we had girls and boys. But sex was evil. It was a taboo, but we all knew that we shouldn't have girlfriends/boyfriends. Those are only for the non believers. And we shouldn't have sex as well untill marriage. We couldn't behave like non believers and take examples in their lifestyles because they didn't know the ""truth"" and were sinners. We could make friendship with them but it shouldn't affect our faith. since I Always was a good student, I took pride in my faith and my dedication again. But even student of said School were not involved in their beliefs. They had this sort of double life were at Muslim school they were believers but outside they weren't. Wherease I was committed in my lifestyle all the way through. Thankfully I had many Muslim Friends in my neighbourhood but again they all had this half-in half-out lifestyle. It was hard to keep up and there were so much contradictions. Like they would go to the mosquee with me Friday morning and do one night stands and party with alcohol and stuff the night. I get it thought. Not everyone is perfect and everyone has flaws, but being this blatantly inconsistent should somewhat distrub you. Because it sure did distrubed me.

To this day I'm still Lost. But part of me think is because I live in this inconsistent settings. There are no rules, no consistency. This makes it very difficult to see the benefits but very easy to see the disadvantages. I can't party and have a girlfriend but I can't also have Muslim Friends my age outside of mosquee because I'm not ""cool"", I don't go out and party.

The biggest one is having this distance beetween Muslim and non Muslim. I thought of religion as a communitary thing but it's highly divisive.

Same with teachers that praises hard work and good attitude in class when your peers condemn focus and dedication. I Guess you have to be in the middle. 

Happy but hardworking as well",1603523515

ESFP,"An overview of the gamma quadra in socionics (model A)/MBTI. The delta quadra types are SEE (in MBTI ESFP), ILI (in MBTI INTJ), LIE  (in MBTI ENTJ) and ESI (in MBTI ISFP).

[https://youtu.be/bHimpQBycs4](https://youtu.be/bHimpQBycs4)

(- Fi)  = Minimization of negative relationships and experiences. Critical of evil. Desire to get away from bad people and poor relationships, as well as to protect themselves from enemies and adversaries. 

(- Te)  = Business logic of risk and entrepreneurship. Rejection of which is useless, insignificant, mundane. This aspect is valued as more important than accumulation and rational consumption. 

(+Se) = Well capable of defending itself and its position. Protectiveness. Ability to defend themselves against all force. Ability to retain that which was acquired. Social mission of purification (to be understood in both the literal and the figurative sense of the word). Restorers of distorted principles, doing all that's necessary to remove barriers and obstacles which limit rapid advancement. This quadra can be called the quadra of criticism and reform. 

(+ Ni)  = constraining their hot temper, these sociotypes prefer to advance gradually into the future, though they may sharply reject obsolete ideas, criticizing past mistakes. Advancing step by step, they generally believe in the linearity of development, i.e. according to their deep convictions, it is only necessary to remove obstacles, remnants of the past, and immediately this will open endless possibilities for growth. This quadra is not afraid of chaos and upheavals: they know how to conduct their work under conditions of change, risk and confusion.

SEE/ESFP +Se -Fi

ILI/INTJ +Ni -Te

ESI/ISFP -Fi +Se

Hidden agendas:

\- SEE/ESFP (Te Mobilizing): To know.

ESFP,"So this a continuation of the other post further elaborating on me and my SO relationship since so many of you our curious. For starters it‚Äôs a long distance open relationship with her being in Europe and me being in the states. We our currently engaged and I‚Äôm working on getting her here to live with me on a visa.  Our relationship is somewhat  perfect as of now and she everything I ever wanted in a girl. She always text to check up on me ( even before our relationship), she would always pay for food and drinks when we would got out, always makes sure I keep in contact with my parents, we never argue, I make laugh everyday. She is just always there for me in every way imaginable as I am for her. The only thing that I am somewhat trying to get use to is this open relationship thing to which is what we initially agreed on at the beginning at her request. She wants it because she‚Äôs still young and wants to live her life but still loves and wants to be with me. Even sees us eventually having a more seriously relationship together once she gets it all out. I kinda still want to fool around too but I‚Äôm almost 30 and kinda feel like I‚Äôm over that life so it‚Äôs almost like I‚Äôm waiting for her to take us more seriously. Before this we were both the type to never to commit to anyone and always tried to just live our single lives the best we can, partying as much as possible and what not. 

That‚Äôs summary of it. I just wanted to see if anyone else had the chance to date another ESFP and share their experience so I can get an idea if it would work before she gets here to live with me. I seem to be the only one in this sub üòÇ",1603332700

Usually right now, it's something we agree on together, or, because I'm such a romantic at heart, I suggest something or plan a surprise for him. I've talked to him about it a lot, and he just says that he's bad at it and that assures me that he loves me a lot and he gets freaked out whenever I'm upset by it because he thinks everything is fine.

ESFP,"It‚Äôs no secret that habit building can be hard. I‚Äôm constantly experimenting with ways to make adoption of better habits a little more seamless for myself. And then, I was introduced to a concept called habit stacking.

Habit Stacking follows the principle that it‚Äôs always easier to practice new habits by attaching them to the tail-end of an existing one. This is formula that you have to bear in mind:

After \[CURRENT HABIT\],

I will \[NEW Habit\]

You‚Äôre essentially taking your willpower out of the equation by following a routine of practices, and can even have stacks on top of stack, If you prefer. It leveraged the power of using a routine to add on new habits and follow it through muscle memory. For example:

After I wake up in the morning, I meditate for 15 minute.

After I meditate for 15 minutes, I workout for an hour.

After I workout for an hour, I handle email and other tasks.

This has even been discussed by James Clear in his bestseller *Atomic Habits* and explains that this is a great way of tapping into the way that our neurons and brain in programmed. I explain this in depth here with examples - [https://youtu.be/7yTQPPW3cQE](https://youtu.be/7yTQPPW3cQE). Hopefully the habit stack might be the answer that you‚Äôre looking for if you want to build habits that you can stick to.",1602950822
ESFP,"¬∑ She will do anything and everything you want her to do and she often will go along with whatever you want and even agree with your preference on something even if she didn‚Äôt initially.

¬∑ Gets nervous extremely easily for things like presentations, interviews, and performances to the point of getting an upset stomach. However if her friends are also nervous, she‚Äôll do her best to try to uplift their spirit with positivity and hype them up to boost their confidence.

¬∑ Very forgiving person who gets over things quicker than most people do. She once had a legal situation happen involving someone close to her betraying her by getting her to lend him a huge sum of money (talking thousands), just for him to use it all up and lie about what happened. Although most people would either sue or at least expect repayment, she let it go because she didn‚Äôt want to cause his situation to get any more difficult for him and wanted to keep things as peaceful as she could.

¬∑ Super hardworking and ambitious when it comes to her dreams and what she‚Äôs passionate about. She practices for things until very late at night and even while brushing her teeth, she continues to practice

¬∑ Took a huge risk moving to another country at a young age without knowing how to speak the language because she wanted to pursue her dream career in that country

¬∑ Big spender; often spends on many items while shopping and when stuck between two choices, she chooses to buy both

¬∑ Enjoys sleeping all day, watching Netflix, and staying home to play with her cats. If she does go out, it‚Äôs usually to eat at a restaurant or take photos with her various cameras.

¬∑ Believes it‚Äôs important to make sure you know what you really want to do and do it because if not now, then when? She thinks you should push forward with what you want to do.

¬∑ Makes the most out of things, has really great positive energy, and has a very radiant smile that makes other people smile just by looking at it. 

¬∑ Hardly ever gets angry and never yells at people. Typically just stays quiet if she‚Äôs mad.

¬∑ Not good at verbally expressing how she feels, but is a very emotional person who cries at many things including movie scenes where she doesn‚Äôt even understand what‚Äôs happening

¬∑ Often will try not to cry because once she does start crying, it takes her a long time to stop. However she‚Äôs not good at holding in her tears, especially once she sees something touching or when she sees another person crying.

¬∑ She‚Äôs a really shy person, but is also bubbly and cheerful. You won‚Äôt catch her feeling sad often. She gets especially shy with crushes and embarrasses herself around them easily.

¬∑ Really generous with people she cares for. She once gave a dance instructor fruits and said she had to hurry before the fruits lose its freshness.

¬∑ She has a really good memory, especially if she sees it. She also can remember things you tell her about yourself quite easily.

¬∑ Enjoys making jokes and teasing her friends. She‚Äôs also really easygoing, so everyone loves making fun of her and joking at her expense because she never takes it seriously.

¬∑ She has worries about things like not being a good role model for the younger people around her like nephews and nieces. Although everything finds her great, she often has thoughts in her head like if she isn‚Äôt doing something good enough or if she messes up and looks bad for those around her, etc.

¬∑ When asked about her wishes, she said she wishes that the people she loves are healthy, hoped that she can experience new things in the future, and be happy with the people she‚Äôs with now for a long time",1602916442

ESFP,"I'm with an ESFP who doesn't tell me if I am doing something he doesn't like, even if I ask, I think because he doesn't like to be negative or confrontational. Instead he acts differently as a hint, like ignoring me when I do/say something that bothers him. And eventually it builds up over time until he reaches a breaking point because I didn't get the hint. 

I feel trapped in this weird double standard where I am expected to guess what he wants based on his hints, but I'm also expected not to take it personally when he does something rude by accident. And I can't ask if he's doing it on purpose because if I'm wrong, then I'm being too negative because it's like I'm calling him rude.

I'm getting mixed signals tho, sometimes he expresses care (asking how I feel with my depression, telling me he relies on me for emotional support, calling me sometimes when he gets time, etc). Not sure if he's interested anymore, we talked abt dating other people and not moving it beyond the fwb status since he's leaving in a few months. Still I can't tell if he's just seeing me because it's convenient for him now or if he actually cares or wants to.

ESFP,"Hey ESFPs! I'm Derek (ENTJ). A few months ago, my friends and I created an MBTI-based dating/friends app called Boo. Some of you may have already heard of it (and know that our first version was actually barely usable). I wanted to let you know about it because we've made a lot of improvements since then and thought you'd be interested in trying it out.

Like many of us, we're hardcore MBTI lovers and enthusiasts and thought it strange that no MBTI app existed yet. We thought MBTI could fix a few problems with current dating apps.

For one, you are recommended people you‚Äôre statistically likely to love and understand effortlessly, instead of being forced to meet every single type of person. Second, you can save time, money, and emotional fatigue you would have spent on bad dates with no chemistry on other dating apps. Third, you can deeply understand each other‚Äôs personalities before you meet and in a way that was never possible before. And fourth, get in-depth dating advice and insight into how to attract and get along with anyone.

[Boo Telepathy Demo](https://i.redd.it/byg6ef7scvs51.gif)

Many of our users are using the app to make friends and foster deeper, more meaningful connections. We pretty much built this app for people like us, so I'd love to get your feedback on how we can make it better.

The app is completely free to use, with added features like Dating Telepathy that are part of a premium membership (to support our operations).

You can download the app through the Apple App Store and Google Play Store links on our website: [https://boo.dating](https://boo.dating/)

ESFP,"So many of us often attribute building good habits and breaking bad habits to how strong our willpower is. This is actually false! In fact, your habits can be completely hacked once you understand the stages of their formation. This can be explained by using Charles Duhigg‚Äôs Habit Loop

The Habit Loop is a neurological loop that governs our habits and comprises of 3 stages:

* Cue: This is the initial trigger for the habit. It can be a location, time, emotional state, etc.
* Routine: The behavior you wish to change or reinforce.
* Reward: The aftermath of the routine that causes to to revisit that habit in the future.

Through my experience, I‚Äôve learnt that it‚Äôs most effective to stick with the same cue and reward and simply manipulate the routine to produce the same result.

The key is to really pay attention to the cues that cause you to engage in the habit and then see if you can get the same reward by altering your routine for a better one. I explain this further here with examples - [https://youtu.be/bUtLiAu5rYc](https://youtu.be/bUtLiAu5rYc). The Habit Loop is completely derived from understanding how this works neurologically and then using it to completely hack your relationship with habits. You got this!",1602346129

I kinda got to know an ESFP girl (at least, I think she's an ESFP, could be ISFP though), and recently I asked her out. I specified that it was no-commitment, I just wanted to get to know her better. Just coffee, you know. Nothing romantic.

But it's so weird! She hasn't responded, though more than 24 hours have passed. Earlier today I joked and asked whether she's waiting for the right moment to answer, but still no answer. Is this usual for ESFPs to back away when asked out? I mean, we get along OK, we enjoy each other's company. And I just thought, you know, why not ask her out? I'm really not that much into her, and I don't think she's that much into me, but I asked her out anyway cuz I wanted to get to know her a little better (we study together, and I try to learn what I can from all my classmates. She's the only one I don't know that well yet).

Honestly, I'm kinda dumbfounded. It doesn't really mean that much to me, because though I think she's very attractive, I didn't have anything romantic or relationship-ish in mind. I honestly just wanted to get to know her better over coffee.

So it‚Äôs been a while and family has been starting to tell me how I‚Äôve become myself again in the last couple of months and also I have really felt myself change. I have definitely become more extrovert again which I know I was as a young kid.

ESFP,"Have you guys ever been tested for an IQ test?

Do you have a decent estimate on your range?

If so could you please share your results.

I would love to see the IQ distribution for ESFPs

Pe dom are pretty clever and are quick to catch up on things/trends however they can also be the most lenient and ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù second guess the most fucking obvious answer 

Despite there being claims that ESFP are one of the types who frequently are supposed to score low on IQ tests but  pretty much all Se doms I‚Äôve met are within 110-115?


Pretty much all ESFP I know are around 115 when it comes to IQ. 
I have assumed this, Since none of them have taken an officially administered one 
So I had to use people who have gotten theirs officially tested or as close to their range as reference point and from there it was just trying rearrange them by their reasoning ability and ‚Äúvibe‚Äù to determine and arrange their intelligence 

Another trend I‚Äôve noticed is those ESFP who are 115+ are in touch with their Ni and these people are more reserved than the archetypal ESFP and are most likely to mistype as Intuitive
Se+Ni LARPS something petty similar to Ne


This also applies for a close buddy of mine who is an ESTJ who is VERY in touch with his Ne and has scored 128 on Mensa Norway. Although it may not be as strong a Ne dom but the preference for Ne for him is stronger than Si

I‚Äôm not sure if the same can be said for intuitive to have similar preference to sensing functions or if preference like those can determine someone‚Äôs intelligence at all but generally speaking I have seen this happen and would love a further elaboration by someone else :)

The smartness may or may not manifest In the same way as a Se doms can easily outsmart Si doms when it comes to street smarts 
But how smart are the Se doms in your life? If you could some how translate their fluid reasoning to IQ? How much have they accomplished within there fields?

So I'm 22 F INFP and friends with 20 M ESFP. Its his birthday  on Tuesday and he is having a big party with a lot of people. He asked me to come also but I really don't want to because its not my scene. 

So what can I do to make it up to him? I feel he is disappointed that I'm not going. I want to do something for him that he would really appreciate. 
(As far as I know he is not so big on birthdays, just excited to have a big party, I dont know if its an ESFP thing or a him thing)

ESFP,"Hello everybody, I was just reading this interesting book titled ""The H Factor of Personality: Why Some People are Manipulative, Self-Entitled, Materialistic, and Exploitive‚ÄîAnd Why It Matters for Everyone"" which talks about a newer personality model called the HEXACO. The HEXACO is basically the same as The Big Five, except that it adds another factor for honest-humility. I was curious if there is any correlation between MBTI type and HEXACO results, so if you guys are willing could you take the official HEXACO test here [https://hexaco.org/hexaco-online](https://hexaco.org/hexaco-online) and then post your number (not graphical) results below (you can download your results in pdf format and when you do that it gives you actual number values, instead of just a graph). I will be posting this in all of the different MBTI types' reddit channels to get an idea of how each type differs in HEXACO results.

ESFP,"We‚Äôre often working extremely hard and trying to find balance across the various realms of our lives. I‚Äôm guilty of this too. This was when I came across The Four Burners Theory which essentially breaks your life into 4 quadrants:

1. Family
2. Friends
3. Health
4. Work

The principle behind this theory is that in order to be truly successful in any of these areas, the intensity of one of these burners needs to be turned down. This sounds like a crappy deal, but the truth is that life is full of tradeoffs and embracing that is the first step to thriving.

There are seasons where some of these burners will thrive more than other and I, personally, choose to make temporary compromises in order to truly give myself to truly succeed at one thing. There are a few ways that I‚Äôve learnt to make the best of finding harmony between my work and the rest of my life including embracing limitations and incorporating seasonality.

This has always been a really interesting concept to me and I dive deep into it here - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khaWb5XqZNM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khaWb5XqZNM) . Hope this helps give you a better idea of how to approach chasing ‚Äúbalance‚Äù in your life.",1600532361

ESFP,"Mario is like the best ESFP character ever, he lives in the moment and responds to details around him. He's very spontaneous and impulsive and confident and follows her inner values and heart and emotions inside with his aux Fi. His Te ter helps him get the job done and he's not overly future oriented at all with his low Ni inferior and doesn't read between the lines very much. He's very hands on with his dom Se and is a plumber and loves to jump and perform in front of people. Details and responding to him with his jumps is everything to Mario, Se doesn't mean you love physical activity. Any type can do and love that, Ne users too love and are great at sports. Princess Daisy is a ENFP. But Mario is the best ESFP character, I'm saying this in celebration of the awesome Super Mario Bros 3D All Stars Collection that just came out. I just got my copy and pre-order in the mail yesterday and I've been loving it so far. I got Mario Sunshine up in the background right now and am playing it now. Its the first time Mario Sunshine has been rereleased so I'm enjoying every minute of it, this game is my childhood even if its not the best and isn't my fav Mario game anymore, that spot goes to Mario Odyssey now and Mario 64 and Mario Bros 3. But yeah I just wanted to highlight this again in celebration of the Mario 3D All Stars release and the 35th anniversary of the series and games, hope you ESFPs out there are having a good there, you guys are awesome.

ESFP,"The Se function, while having the letter ""E"",  simply means having a proactive attitude towards seeking qualities of experience and information in the world.  It has nothing to do with being socially outgoing or being an 'extrovert' in the colloquial sense (recharging around others). 

Too many people conflate ""extroverted sensing"" or ""E"" with ""extrovert"" and call it a day. I'd imagine many people shy away from considering ESFP as their type due to the stereotypes and this idea that introverts can't be ESFP or that ESFPs don't like abstract thinking because Ni is repressed (false).   


The fact is, there are many variants of ESFP and some of these can be quite heavy in Fi or Ni. ESFP represents Gamma first and foremost (the best quadra!), with Pe being our primary function (exploration). We share similar values and themes with Gammas, and share our mode of operation with the other ExxPs. But socially we can be anything, an extrovert or an introvert.",1600375069

Hint 1
The other day I happened to glance over while he was texting his sister and I noticed she asked if I was around because she wanted to ask something, and then I saw the word ‚Äúring‚Äù mentioned. I quickly looked aways because I wasnt intentionally snooping and I wouldnt want to read something someone doesnt want me to know. 

Hint 2
My best friend called me and asked me, ‚Äúif you were to ever get engaged, how long do you think an engagement would be?‚Äù I said ‚ÄúI dont know, maybe a year‚Äù. So then she goes, ‚Äúhmm ok, so I would have a year to lose weight? Good to know‚Äù

Hint 3
Today my boyfriend told me he had tickets he never got to use to the carribean, he wanted to know if I was interested in using them with him, and he was thinking of going in January. I nodded and realized that would he the month of our 1 year anniversary and 

Hint 4
This is the most obvious hint so I left it last but he asked me what diamond shape engagement ring I would want

ESFP,"We all know how hard it can be to stick to a new habit. Picking up any good habit essentially lays the groundwork for a more successful and fulfilled life. There are, however, some habits that have a trickle down effect and make the adoption of other habits a lot easier. These are Keystone Habits.

Keystone Habits are those changes to your life that create a domino effect and carry over into other aspect of your life.

One of my favorites is Exercise - Studies have shown that people who regularly exercise tend to eat healthier, consume less alcohol, be more productive at their work and sleep better, than those who don‚Äôt.

Some of my other favorite Keystone Habits are:

* Meditation
* Journaling,
* Building a morning routine.

The incorporation of these particular habits in your day can have the most unexpected positive ripple effects that you‚Äôll end up being so happy with.

ESFP,"Hi ESFPs of the internet,

I realized recently that CSJoseph was pretty much the only guy who talks about the 4 sides of our minds and that got me thinking about our relationship with other types. I used to take his words for gospel (Ti trickster?) but now I‚Äôm more critical of his approach to functions. So idk I thought I‚Äôd write what Si/Fe/Ti/Ne evoke to me.

Do y‚Äôall relate to the following?

- Nemesis: Si = I can‚Äôt stand traditional people who won‚Äôt budge or deviate from what they know, their routine, the whole deal. The kind that don‚Äôt wanna take risks, leave their comfort zone etc. What‚Äôs a comfort zone anyway? So yeah I tend to have a conflicting relationship with strong Si users. I guess that‚Äôs my definition of a nemesis

- Critic: Fe = good old folks who wanna tell me how I should feel about things. There‚Äôs a lot of hypocrisy and virtue signaling but it‚Äôs not a nemesis relationship and I think it‚Äôs not as strong a conflict as Se/Si. Like I can learn from them but I‚Äôm quick to criticize whenever I deem their Fe as inappropriate.

- Trickster: Ti = when you‚Äôre hearing something new from someone else and they kinda back it up with some sort of evidence and you go Se/Te mode and totally don‚Äôt use internal logic to challenge it. God I‚Äôve done that so many times ‚Äúwe‚Äôre herbivores! Wait no we‚Äôre carnivores! that loner on the internet said something it must be true! Watch me reinvent the wheel!‚Äù. TJ users for instance will have much more skepticism of anything that challenges conventional thinking (which may make them too conservative?). I think it‚Äôs not as bad for us as it is for NFPs as we would obviously stop believing in nonsense when it fails miserably in real life applications?

- Demon: Ne = I guess the term ‚Äúvaporware‚Äù is appropriate. Fun part is I used to enjoy fictive stuff as a teenager, Tolkien worlds and whatnot. Not anymore tho. I haven‚Äôt even watched movies or tv shows in years unless on a date üòè if it‚Äôs not something that‚Äôs happening in my life right now why even bother?",1599755265

Yes, I smile and laugh a lot and do silly things, often for the enjoyment of the people around me tbh. Cause I reflect the energy and atmosphere of those around me and when they‚Äôre happy, I‚Äôm happy. When they are enjoying their time with me, I‚Äôm enjoying that time together too.

Yes, I lack knowledge of many almost basic things thanks to my inability to pay close attention to somethings (many things if we‚Äôre being honest) and connect the dots. The things I don‚Äôt know would make a sis blush (if I could) from embarrassment if it ever came to light.

¬∑ One thing she likes about herself is that she‚Äôs pretty positive and bubbly, likes to keep things light-hearted and entertaining around friends. She loves making people feel loved and doesn‚Äôt dwell on things too much

¬∑ Something she‚Äôd like to change is her indecisiveness because she struggles making decisions since she‚Äôs scared of making the wrong one. She said she needs to be more assertive and go with her gut, and she‚Äôs a procrastinator.

¬∑ Although she has felt depressed/anxious at times, she said she‚Äôs blessed to have a great supportive network of friends/family

¬∑ She‚Äôs quite shy, but it depends on the time and place too because she‚Äôs happy to interact with new people. However at a place like a party, she‚Äôs really awkward and shy.

¬∑ In terms of relationships, she finds it important to see what someone prioritizes in life, how they treat their family, their goals/ambitions, their sense of humor, their loyalty, and communication skills

¬∑ She hates confrontation, but believes it‚Äôs important to express your emotions and thoughts if there‚Äôs something upsetting you.

¬∑ She used to be obsessive over her grades, but learned to not put too much stress on them once she grew older. 

¬∑ Sometimes she compares herself to others and although she admits it can be toxic, she says it also pushes her to try harder and become a better version of herself. She always compares herself to others who have their shit together and do well career wise.

¬∑ Responds to hate in a really patient, nice way. She says you can‚Äôt stop people thinking the way they want to think, so you should just be kind when you can

¬∑ Believes people should choose a career they‚Äôre passionate about and enjoy doing. She said it‚Äôs all about trial and error, and to look at the bigger picture and envision where you‚Äôd want to be in 10 years.

¬∑ Hardworking, but often is overworked, stressed, and sleep deprived

¬∑ Lifestyle is all over the place at times (ex: eating one meal a day and sleeping at 4am)

¬∑ Some things that really annoy her include people who bail on plans at last minute all the time, people who can‚Äôt do simple things on their own because they‚Äôre lazy so they depend on others, and people who have no respect for others‚Äô time.

¬∑ Usually needs to study in a library because she can‚Äôt study well at home.

¬∑ Gets excited about new, exciting opportunities

¬∑ Studied law in college because she found her law class in high school interesting; however, she‚Äôs reconsidering careers in law because she prefers doing something in marketing",1599707811

ESFP,"I‚Äôm not too sure if I‚Äôm an ESFP or an ENFP because I find that I exhibit characteristics of both  

1. I am not aware of my surroundings much at all and often do end up being lost in my thoughts and becoming easily distracted. Also while I am terrible at remembering names I am good at detecting changes in people (e.g new haircut etc) 

2. I am really good at understanding people and their motives but I usually do it by reading their body language with some speculation mixed in. 

3. I have really good reflexes but have poor hand eye coordination. I usually find that I‚Äôm one of the first to react to a scenario but would not be first choice on a sports team. I‚Äôm also quite clumsy and always found voice acting easier than regular drama because I‚Äôm not too good at moving on stage 

4. I am somewhat practical - I don‚Äôt like discussing philosophy for a long time because I don‚Äôt see the point (though I‚Äôm sure there is one) of going on for hours about something that doesn‚Äôt have an answer or help me in my daily life but am happy to have the occasional conversation. I think I enjoy small talk but more importantly I love understanding what makes people tick, especially the closed off ones! I also love murder mysteries :) I find that my sister (ISFJ) is much more practical and grounded than I am but I do often find my NT friends to not really be that in touch with reality, actual practical reality. I did get really friendly with one INFJ guy, and omg trying to understand him was equal parts amazing and frustrating. I felt he was so much more idealistic than me, he looked at the world, saw that it was shit but still wanted it to be better. Whereas I look at the world, see that it‚Äôs shit and go OK, but here are it‚Äôs good parts and opportunities, how can I take advantage of that? My point being that, I‚Äôm not too sure if I lean more towards the intuition or sensing side. I also have an ENFP male friend, who I felt also had a lot of pie in the sky ideas and grand perceptions of himself but I felt reality was quite different and is follow through was a bit weak. 

5. I wouldn‚Äôt consider myself to be highly fashionable and for the longest time, I didn‚Äôt even care much about my appearance. It was only once I started working in corporate I realised the importance of dressing well, particularly in client facing roles so I‚Äôve been putting in a bit more effort but I‚Äôve still got a loooong way to go.

I wish people would appreciate me, instead of telling me off to ""Grow up"", which I take offense in this, because it always makes me feel like I am not perfect to others for oblivious reason.  


I overall fear the future, I do not want to approach the future, mainly because I dont want to age up and become old, losing my physicality, my young beauty, and ability to experience being in the moment to the fullest. I overall hate thinking about the future, and most of the time I just feel nostalgia to the past, but always and foremost, my importance is to embrace living in the moment, being lively, enjoy beauty, nature, the lively atmosphere in cities, competition, being with your friend(s), cool activities, afterall, this is what only matters to me.  


Unfortunately, I dont leave th house often, because I dont have much social activities available to me to go to that would entertain me. I usualy go outside like 2 or 3 times per week for 2 hours around to enjoy those listed activties I previously mentioned, and thats all, unfortunately I'm not a fan of just going outside mindlessly without any interesting activity or just anything interesting.

ESFP,"Ok so i was typed as estp but i do indentify sometimes with esfp.


1. I have tons of passionate when it comes on doing things i like (programming,mma,diet, talking about mbti).

2. I like talking with people about the stuff i do and listening and i like taking risks but not stupid ones like jumping out a roof and etc.

3. I do try think logical when something terrible is happening but sometimes i do feel hurt.

4.  I smile a lot with people and like making jokes. When people are ignoring me i do feel kinda hurt but i get over it like after minute or two.

5. With friends i am more trust oriented. Which means if you break the trust with me, I won't talk to you again.

6. I do speak what's on my mind if someone does something bad to me and not afraid of criticism. (Like demanding respect and etc).

7. I don't want to hurt or betray my friends and give respect.

8. I don't like hookups but more relationship (had only two , one six years and the current one year)
Because of intimacy, yet my gf says that sometimes I don't give her attention.

9. I like being enthusiastic about the things i like and do and can talk about them a lot (not 3 hours but more or less than a hour)",1599557998

ESFP,"\- Always speaks her mind when she has a problem with something. For example, a girl in our table kept accidentally interrupting her. She sassily confronted her saying, ‚ÄúGirl are you gonna let me talk or nah? You keep interrupting me every few seconds.‚Äù The same girl was also eating a lot of the gummy bears my friend brought to class. My friend then said, ‚ÄúHide the gummy bears because if you don‚Äôt, she‚Äôll eat them all by the time we get back‚Äù in front of the girl‚Äôs face.

\- Loves to brag about everything from her grades to her baking skills to how much she gyms. She tends to talk about how she‚Äôs a really nice, kind person. For example, she once took a survey for a stranger because she said she knows how it feels to not have people take a survey. 

\- She can be quite arrogant about her abilities, often bragging about how smart she is whenever she gets a good grade on an exam. Sometimes this arrogance leads to putting others down, like she once repeatedly told everyone around her, ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt do math‚Äù when she was solving math problems. However whenever she does poorly, she constantly talks about how she‚Äôs so stupid and how she‚Äôs sad. I assume it‚Äôs to get reassurance, but I‚Äôm not sure.

\- Always thinks she‚Äôs right. We‚Äôve done group work problems together and I showed her an answer was wrong with evidence from online sources. However she refused to believe them and still stuck to her own answer, claiming that those online sources are incorrect.

\- Aggressive personality and goes after what she wants. She typically doesn‚Äôt take my food when I offer her some. However I brought in expensive chocolate for our class table to share, and she ended up putting them under her desk then asked if she could have them all even though the others in our table only had one piece. After doing this, she justified herself saying her family never takes free things though.

\- We had a class in the late afternoon and she left an hour early every class session to go to the gym since she refused to get home any later than her usual time. The professor passive-aggressively called her out on leaving class, but she disobeyed him and continued doing it, saying he can‚Äôt control her.

\- She openly admitted to being rude, but says it‚Äôs a good thing because people of her culture are extremely blunt. 

\- Often struggles making up her mind about a decision because she keeps second guessing. Always asks detailed questions for a long time and says things like, ‚ÄúAre you gonna be able to help me out? I can‚Äôt fail.‚Äù

\- Can get controlling in group work if no one‚Äôs doing anything, especially since she hates free riders. Once in a class, she yelled at a group member and demanded him to do work since he wasn‚Äôt doing anything. She said she can yell at them because she‚Äôs close to them (in her perspective).

\- She‚Äôs extremely playful, enjoys teasing/roasting people at their expense, engages in a lot of banter, is always laughing. However she can take her jokes too far and is unaware when people get annoyed at her jokes. 

\- She‚Äôs pretty impatient and cares a lot about time. The first thing she prioritizes with choosing class schedules is the time. She also rushes to get home. However with classes, she also tries to avoid professors who are mean.

\- Considers herself close to someone she meets only after a short period of time. She‚Äôll only have spoken to someone in class for a few weeks then say she‚Äôs close to them. 

\- She speaks to strangers as if she‚Äôs already friends with them. The first thing she ever said to me when we didn‚Äôt know each other yet was that she isn‚Äôt forgiving me for not choosing the college she wanted to go to, but couldn‚Äôt get into. She once also spoke to a stranger, asking them about her favorite boy band and fangirling about them.

\- She does whatever she pleases to the point of even sneaking behind a professor‚Äôs desk to take pictures of his textbook without permission.

\- Doesn‚Äôt like acting cheesy or expressing things like missing her friends when they leave. However she‚Äôs quite open with her emotions, often saying that she cried herself to sleep or how she‚Äôs so anxious or stressed over this or that. 

\- She boldly cheats on exams, taking out notes when the professor‚Äôs close in proximity. She has also gotten caught cheating before, but lied to the teacher and got away with it then proceeded to brag.

\- Friendly, outgoing, very chatty, helpful, can be pretty loud, and can be generous at times. She has helped me out with homework assignments and given me free answers. She also sometimes brings food to share or gives me snacks for free (even though she gets them free).

\- Has skipped classes to drive 8 hours to another city in order to go to her favorite group‚Äôs concert. 

\- Cheap unless it comes to her favorite boy band, which she‚Äôll spend hundreds for. She downloads free textbooks instead of purchasing them.

\- She said many people find her intimidating when they meet her, probably because she has a strong personality and already acts like she‚Äôs close to whichever stranger she‚Äôs speaking to.

\- Not sure if this is manipulation, but she wanted me to help her out with her internship and said she‚Äôs asking because she wants me to learn the useful information for my own good. She also kept trying to persuade me into doing the task, mentioning how all of her friends are doing it and listing reasons why it‚Äôs beneficial for me. Basically she reminded me of those marketing people who persuade sales.

\- She was desperately looking for a job over the summer last year because she said she can‚Äôt stay home all day.

\- Has given me unsolicited advice about paying my own bills to not leech off of my parents, etc.

\- Her school note are really organized and color coordinated, but her clothes at home are in a huge pile.

\- Enjoys keeping up with celebrities, running a celebrity fan page, baking and cooking, going to the gym, and watching anime.

ESFP,"For the past year, I‚Äôve been creating videos online and growing an audience through that. And then, last week, my channel hit 1000 subscribers. This was a goal that seemed kind of unattainable a few months ago. While this is a small milestone and there‚Äôs plenty of growth left to take place, I think there are a few key things that I‚Äôve learned along the way‚Ä¶ and these are things that can be applied to starting any venture from the ground up.

1. Set a goal that you can control
2. Aim for Consistency
3. Be open to making sacrifices
4. Identify what you enjoy about the process
5. Pay attention to the market (or audience)
6. Have Patience

I made that part very clear to her and she has told me that she has also found me to be cute and attractive. I eventually got the nerve to ask her to hang out and we have spent a lot of time together. She‚Äôs super fun to be around and her presence is really intriguing. It‚Äôs never a dull moment during our hang outs. We have had sex and we have been on dates, but she hates labels and does not want me to begin to classify us as anything other than friends, which I understand. She isn‚Äôt really ready for anything serious at the moment and I understand that too. 

My question though, is how do I approach her about becoming more serious when she is in a place more suitable for that? I feel like the thought of something more scares her and I don‚Äôt want to bring up something like that and tell her that I want to be with her just to have it result in me being pushed away or to have it ruin our friendship and how close we are.

We met at work and have always been good friends and physically affectionate, and then around a month ago we started sleeping together when I initiated sex with him. After than we were very wrapped up in each other, and the first time we slept together I heard him say ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù under his breath. We would see each other almost every day and it was the happiest I‚Äôve been in a while. 
To put this into context, we‚Äôve met each other‚Äôs friends, we‚Äôve opened up emotionally to each other and clicked on many levels. Bearing in mind as well that we‚Äôve been good friends for a year up until now. 

However, I‚Äôm worried because that now we‚Äôre back at work he has been pulling away from me and not wanting to see me one-on-one. He doesn‚Äôt want to come over anymore, not even for sex, and when I asked he fobbed me off with the vague promise of a drink sometime. I believe he‚Äôs scared that I now want an exclusive relationship, which I would definitely like if he was up for it, but I‚Äôd also be happy just hanging out like we did before. 

Can anyone give me an insight into what he might be thinking, and how best to proceed? I don‚Äôt want to lose the potential of what we could have, but also I‚Äôm worried that I might be scaring him off completely and I wouldn‚Äôt have him in my life at all. Why might he be pulling away now that we‚Äôve been intimate, when I think the more natural thing is to get emotionally closer?

And the thing is, she also told me she's not the type to have sex around with different dudes but still she admits she's been going on dates( let's say alot) just to get food, yes she did say that, just to get food, which makes me think she has a tendency of taking advantage of guys that like her. She's been partying and admit that she does have alot of guys hitting her up which isn't really a surprise to me, she's hooked up with with several guys the last few months but She also says she's never cheated before and the other day we went out and she posted me on her private snap, some guy she was talking to, texted her, cursing etc.. she told me she hooked up with him a year ago, once, then she turns around and says twice and a year ago she had a boyfriend so I was confused and pointed it out, she said she meant to say, last year, not year ago, that he was the first person she got with after her boyfriend but that it has been on and off. I let it slide but overall, I've had experiences with ESFPs in the past, it was great and I also know they don't have the best morals when it comes to dating and I know from experience, ESFPs tend to hide their different faces if they really like someone and don't want to be judged. I've been pretty non judgmental, we talk and I've been hooking up with different girls in the past and I'm also too non chalant to be judging others. I typically accept the good and bad side of people as long as the connection is genuine. 

There's also the fact that she needs her papers and her parents from abroad have been pressuring her and she has to get married in order to have them. We talked about it and I'd be willing to help her out in the future but she really wants to commit and  talks about marriage and having a husband which really isn't an ESFP trait as you guys mostly take relationships on a day to day basis, going with the flow. 

I just need an ESFP's intake on this situation. She seems like she genuinely likes me and we definitely have a connection, on the other hand I know she's looking for something. I'm just confused. Maybe she's hiding her true colors in fear of being judged or until she gets what she's looking for. 

Overral, I just texted her this:  

And btw, I gotta tell you this. just be yourself. We talked about commitment and all of that other bullshit.. I'm really focused on myself and Yh I'm a free spirit too just like you are. Let's not rush commitment if it doesn't come naturally and is something you actually wanna do .. just don't limit yourself. You gotta want it bad enough to do so, or like us bad enough to stay with just me. So don't force yourself to commit to one person and let's build off what we have. I'm not gonna cheat, you're all I need . I'm gonna be chilling. Focused on growth while also having fun with only you. I'm definitely hooked , I have feelings for you but I'm not gonna expect much from you but honesty. Communicate and be your fun self. I'll be here for you. I'm yours if that's what you really want. Just go with the flow and if staying in one relationship is what you really want, it'll come naturally.

ESFP,"Goal setting can be a tricky thing. There‚Äôs so much that I‚Äôve wanted to accomplish but not everything that I have my eye on is the right fit for me. Some of these things were not going to fulfill and some of them were not clearly defined objectives that I could pursue.

This is where the SMART Goal-Setting Technique comes in. This model helps you narrow down your objectives based on 5 criteria -

S: Specific - Is it a clearly defined goal?

M: Measurable - Is it something that you can track or measure progress with?

A: Achievable - Is it truly something attainable or are you planning on becoming immortal?

R: Relevant - Is this goal relevant to the vision that you have for your lift?

T: Time-based - Is it something you can set a time limit on?

This framework has helped provide so much clarity with whatever I want to achieve and I‚Äôve broken this down in depth here - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T\_irWkOPC5I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_irWkOPC5I)

If your challenged 24/7 n can‚Äôt chill?",1598039569
ESFP,"I believe I'm a Te dom or Se dom, but I don't know which.

**What makes you angry?**

I get angry when people don‚Äôt listen when I advise them to do something that I know is for their own good. I also dislike laziness, pushovers, getting treated badly by people who I treated well, and people who aren‚Äôt independent.

**What do you like/dislike most about yourself?**

I like that I‚Äôm strong, independent, aggressive, good with money and investments, intelligent, outgoing, cheerful, funny, easygoing, and a good cook. I dislike that I was born with low energy  and bad health because it affects my ability to make more money. However, I wasn‚Äôt smart with money when I was younger (in my teen and young adult years) because I didn‚Äôt care about anything at all and I was extremely simple. I just lived day by day without caring about responsibilities even though I did still get all my work done and excelled in school.

**Do you care about being fashionable? why/why not?**

When I was young, I used to wear makeup and dress up in nice clothes because I liked impressing others. Now that I‚Äôm older and already a mom, I don‚Äôt care about looking good. I just want to be comfortable. When I shop, I look for comfort and cheap deals, often buying things that I don‚Äôt need just because the sale is good.

**What makes you feel secure?**

I feel secure when I have good investments, a lot of money, high savings, hardworking children who are married with kids, and when I‚Äôm careful about things. Because I‚Äôm paranoid of COVID, I get a sense of security from shopping for high quality masks, hand sanitizers, and staying at home. Also, when I shop for items, I have to triple check every detail to make sure it‚Äôs the right thing and that nothing is a scam.

**What do you spend the most time thinking about?**

I spend most of my time thinking about money and health. I really love reading health books and watching videos about health posted by doctors. I also always tune in weekly for this talk show that teaches people about investments, savings, and other tips when it comes to finances. I also spend a lot of time worrying about my children‚Äôs future. Aside from that, I like to find new recipes for different food I can try cooking, but I don‚Äôt listen to the directions at all. I will simply get a brief idea of how to cook it then do everything on my own without instructions. I find following recipes exactly how they should be annoying and tedious, so I usually just do taste tests.

**How do you respond to clingy people?**

My husband is pretty clingy and dependent on me, which can get annoying sometimes because I want everyone to be independent. I don‚Äôt have any strong opinion on clinginess, but I do value the freedom of doing things on my own at times and don‚Äôt like when people ask me things like where I‚Äôm going or when I‚Äôll be back home.

**When you are romantically interested in an individual, how do you generally act (shy, outgoing, annoying, etc.)?**

When I was young, I was shy and didn‚Äôt talk to my crushes. I just admired them from afar. I got married at age 18, so I can‚Äôt say how I‚Äôd act around a crush nowadays. However, all of my shyness was in the past and I‚Äôm extremely outgoing now. In my marriage, I typically try to be in charge, but sometimes my husband calls the shots since I can‚Äôt get everything my way.

**What portrayal of the future do you like the best?**

My biggest wish is to hit the lottery then own a hotel and a big house with a car. I also want all my of children to be married, have their own children, have good jobs, and have good health.",1597989406

ESFP,"Some of my friends and I have trouble deciding if our friend is ESFJ or ESTJ, so I posted on those subreddits. However, someone suggested she may be an ESFP.

\- People are often intimidated by her upon first meeting because she has a super strong personality. She likes to roast people and banter with them even if she's only known them for a day. She also appears extremely outgoing from the get-go, speaking to strangers as if she's already known them for a long time. I was intimidated by her because when we met from a group project, she was a bit rude, controlling, temperamental, and confrontational while leading us. However, I got to know her better after that and she redeemed herself because she has a very playful personality and doesn't have bad intentions when she acts mean. 

\- Her self-esteem fluctuates from very confident to sometimes being insecure, but she typically has high self-confidence. She likes bragging about her accomplishments, but when there are setbacks, she speaks about herself negatively (ex: calling herself dumb). She also speaks negatively as a way to get pity and possibly reassurance since she repeatedly insults herself.

\- When it comes to school, she needs a lot of guidance. She always asks for my advice on which classes to register for and overthinks every choice. She fears taking classes alone because she thinks she might fail without friends. She takes super long to finalize a decision since she's always hesitating between choices and asking thousands of questions.

\- She's good at understanding where others are coming from. One time, a stranger asked us to take a survery and I declined sicne I was lazy, but she helped and said it's because she knows how it feels from personal experience when people rejected her while she had a similar task.

\- She can be pretty helpful and usually isn't the type of person to be greedy. I've offered her food and other things, but she typically doesn't take anything unless I insist. She gives me free food from her home sometimes and has let me copy her work. One of her biggest pet peeves is free-riders who take everything yet never give back. Although she's pretty nice, she can also exaggerate how good of a person she is. A lot of times she likes to tell stories about how kind-hearted she is.

\- We've ditched class in the middle of a lab and our professor passive-aggressively called us out for it. She continued ditching and ignored what he said because she claimed he can't control us. 

\- Her hobbies include keeping up with male celebrities, running a fanpage of them, going to the gym, baking, and cooking. She skipped class to drive to a city 8 hours away for a concert.

\- She's uncomfortable with cheesy things like giving goodbye speeches, but she's not really uncomfortable about speaking about her emotions. She's told me about crying herself to sleep, being stressed / anxious, and how she's emotional on her period.

\- She has called herself a rude person but she doesn't see this as a bad thing since her family is like that. She's also somewhat aggressive with getting what she wants. One time I brought a variety of food for a few friends to share, but she snatched the whole thing asking if she could take it all even though the others barely had any.

\- She exaggerates how hardworking she is, claiming that she doesn't know why she failed an exam when she studied nonstop for a week. At the same time, once she does well on an exam, she then claims she barely tried.

\- She's quite concerned with saving time and is a fast-paced person. We both hate waiting for buses and often sprint to make the soonest one coming even if it'll be crowded. 

\- She feels close to people very quickly. As long as she speaks to someone a few times, she'll claim they're a friend and if she knows them on a level that's closer than a classmate, she'll say she's close to them.",1597186552

ESFP,"Hey everyone.

My name is Oliver Powell. I'm a psychologist and my personality type is is ESTP 8w7 sx/sp.

I wanted to give all of you a warning, as I ran a check on the YouTuber CS Joseph and I found out that he's full of bullshits. He is a con artist and he is horrible at typology.

1. MBTI is about cognitive preferences. It doesn't automatically equal skills. Chase doesn't keep that in mind, so he ends up using a lot of bullshit stereotypes. No wonder that he mistypes a lot of people.
2. Any combo of enneagram and MBTI is possible. Enneagram covers basic motivations... But he disregards the enneagram, fusing automatically basic motivations within cognitive functions, ending up easily mistyping people. For instance he insists in claiming that Frank James is an INFP, when Frank James is an INFJ with enneagram 4w5.
3. Some of the concepts that he talks about are in a nutshell a bastardized version of socionics model A, but repackaged with different terminology. For instance his ""four sides of the mind"" are called in socionics model A as ego block, id block (unconscious ego), super id block (subconscious ego) and superego block.
4. He isn‚Äôt an ENTP as he claims. Chase is an unhealthy ESTJ (ego Te Si Ne Fi) 6w5 SO 613 often stuck in Te-Ne loops and on top of that he has most likely ASPD.

First of all Chase is a Te Dom:

4D valued Leading/Dominant Te: ""*Extroverted logic as base function is manifested as a need to accumulate factual information, also from external sources such as books, second-hand information, etc, on matters of personal interest or of professional activity. This also gives these types confidence on being well-informed on the same matters, which enables them to enter arguments related to them with confidence on their knowledge, which may come across as arrogance to others. Another manifestation is an evaluation of external reality - work activities, world events, finances, procedures, personal relationships, conversations - from the point of view of factual accuracy and ""making sense"" and efficiency. It leads to an inclination to be proactive in increasing the efficiency and reasonableness of the external world, as well as a sense of self-worth connected on being involved and productive in activities seen as useful, profitable, or that increase one's knowledge base. To give out information that the individual knows not to be factually accurate is disturbing and avoided as much as possible.""*

His second slot Si is poorly developed and he often turns it off, enganging often in Te-Ne loops:

*""ESTJs can also develop a warped or imbalanced use of their auxiliary function, Introverted Sensing (Si). When this happens,* ***they become obsessed with sticking to what they know, rapidly closing off alternate viewpoints and perspectives. They may become deeply upset by change¬† or they may become focused on seeing impracticalities in others. They may become so tied to their own personal, subjective experience that they discount other people‚Äôs experiences or are unwilling to see other perspectives.*** *Healthy Si is very aware of details, facts, sense-impressions, and important memories. It is practical, responsible, and highly attuned to changing patterns. Unhealthy Si feels that everything needs to fall in adherence with one‚Äôs own subjective experience of how things have always been.""*

\^ Hence the over-generalization that Chase makes all over in his videos.

Look at this description and you'll realize that his Ne is actually third slot, not first slot as he claims:

2D valued Mobilizing/Child: ""***The individual deeply appreciates people who are full of ideas and imagination and who give them a sense of connectedness to what is happening ""out there in the world,"" even if this information cannot be applied practically at the present momen****t. He is even more grateful for people who provide insightful ideas and unconventional analysis to enhance what he is working on or going through at the present moment.""*

You can see Chase often complimenting and appreciating people who are full of ideas, for example nominating in several occasion his mentor and talking about him.

Chase is often looping between Te and Ne:

*""When an ESTJ is in a Te-Ne loop, they are unable to effectively access their introverted functions, Si and Fi. During these times, they become obsessed with possibilities, but often in a negative light. They may see a million ways things could go wrong and try to ‚Äújump in‚Äù and fix them as quickly as possible without looking at the facts or taking the time to carefully observe the situation internally. They may have a difficult time prioritizing or reaching their goals and they may take hasty action on strange, intuitive whims without really understanding where their premonitions are coming from. This can be a very stressful stage for them as they feel more and more frustrated by their inability to organize, plan, and decide as effectively as they usually do. It‚Äôs important for ESTJs who realize they‚Äôre in a Te-Ne loop to get healthy access to Si. Take some time to enjoy some peace and quiet and reflect on an experience you enjoy. Find a favorite activity that you‚Äôve always enjoyed, whether it‚Äôs a crossword puzzle or cooking a certain meal, and repeat that process. Give yourself time to ‚Äúintrovert‚Äù and do some no-pressure detail-oriented project. Getting Si back into the picture will help you regain composure and get out of a loop.""*

As further proof of him being an ESTJ:

*- He finds Ni irritating (Ni being Vulnerable/Trickster for ESTJs), despising INFJs (the conflictuals of ESTJs) and having problems with INTJs (different methods to get effective results done).*

*- He praises a lot Ti, which in ESTJ is their Observing function, and in particular ISTPs. And the default communication style of ISTP is the best way to communicate with ESTJs.*

*- Love/hate relationship with high Fi users, but in particular xNFP types. It points to Fi Suggestive/Inferior.*

*- He is a more chaotic than usual for ESTJs due to being in Te-Ne loops.*

Some people think that Chase's main enneagram is 3w4, but what they're sensing is the disintegration phase of Chase.

Chase is an unhealthy 6w5.

*""Unhealthy 6w5 become increasingly paranoid and obsessed with maintaining their security, and may go to great lengths to protect their positions. They are extremely needy, and may abuse alcohol or drugs as a way of dealing with anxiety and paranoid delusions, as well as of bolstering their inferioirty feelings. The Five-wing adds elements of cynicism and nihilism to the fearful mentality of the unhealthy Six, resulting in growing isolation, desperation, and a capacity for sociopathic actions. Intense stress will likely lead to outbreaks of rage and extremely destructive behavior accompanied by breaks with reality. Self-sabotaging, self-destructive actions bring about humiliation and punishment to atone for guilt, although the extent and nature of their self-destructiveness will be hidden from others because of their reclusive nature. There may be strong propensity for violence as well as sadomasochistic tendencies in sexual expression. Murder and suicide are both real possibilities.""*

Primary instinct SO (social). Tritype 613, considering that one of his ex mentioned how much Chase tends to avoid conflicts (*main instinct core 1*) and his self esteem is based on achievements (*3 as main heart core*).

Unhealthy 613s disintegrate towards 349... 6 disintegrates to 3: competive and arrogant; 1 disintegrates to 4: moody and irrational \[*like claiming that the sperm becomes the brain, spine and nervous system... Look at the video analysis""What MBTI personality is sperm"" by FlowState lol*\]; 3 disintegrates to 9: \[disengaged and apathetic.

So the question is... Why he lies about his type?

The whole ENTP charade is how he justifies his unhealthy behaviours and avoids therapy.

Amongst his unhealthy behaviours, I‚Äôll mention that‚Ä¶

* Chase committed identity theft.
* One of his exes went to a therapist after frequenting him due to how much emotional damage he caused to her during their relationship.
* As mentioned by his ex Ande Sloeijk, Chase displayed behaviours that they‚Äôre congruent with someone with NPD (*amorous subtype*) or similar in their courtship.
* He persuaded a couple to avoid seeking help for their autistic son. Flowstate made a video analysis on the topic on Youtube. (**CS Joseph's Dangerous Advice | ""Ignore Your Son's Doctors"" | Criticism)**
* Pathological lying.
* A lot of passive-aggressiveness.
* Misleading information about his figure income to trick people into giving him more money. Flowstate made an approximate audit about Chase‚Äôs business (‚Äú**Cooking the Books: C.S. Joseph's Whopping 6 Figure Income Audited and Analyzed)**

It's highly likely that Chase has personality disorders. Probably ASPD in comorbity with NPD, but to say for sure a proper assessment would be needed.

Don‚Äôt donate to him. Don‚Äôt buy his services.

You have failed typology Chase Joseph.",1596999821

ESFP,"So I figured I'd talk about one of the most obvious ESFPs ever with Super Mario himself here from the Super Mario Bros game series. Mario is ESFP and is one of the best ones of all time as we all know and the biggest video game character in the world made by a ENFP video game creator being Shigeru Miyamoto himself, an Ne dom in Nintendo and core foundation on why Nintendo succeeded in the 90s with his Ne idea on making the Arcade game Donkey Kong way back then that blew up and changed the world as we know. Which all led to Mario Bros and the Super Mario Bros. series and games we know and love today. Miyamoto an ENFP made Mario an ESFP and Link an ISFP, so there you have it, some of the greatest video game characters of all time are SPs not NFs or intuitive, let's give it up for them here, Mario is the the best and greatest ESFP game character and best ESFP character possibly ever and here's why with my opinion down below.

Super Mario Bros, can't wait to talk about this one and Mario here. Mario is energetic, fun, goofy, down to earth and practical. He's very hands on and is good with a hammer and a plumber at that which all works perfectly with his hands on Se and his Se reacting to details around him and using his hammer when necessary to smash things and enemies and his classic jumping ability as well. Mario uses his Se to jump very easily in the world around him and react and respond to details fully in the moment, he pays attention to all details around him with his Se and responds and reacts to details spontaneously and impulsively with his Se dom impulsiveness and spontaneity fully in the moment and is a excellent jumper because of it and his Se skills as an ESFP. He follows his inner values and heart inside which is all Fi, and doesn't care for what society says or thinks and goes on dangerous adventures and tries to save princess peach whenever he can and when necessary. He gets the job done with his Te ter and gets goals done with the things he cares about and is sometimes efficient when he can be and never fails to hop in and try to save Peach with a moments notice with his Te efficiency being third and Se jumping in on impulse in the moment and responding to details quickly when Peach gets kidnapped and jumping at the chance and moment to save her immediately without hesitation. He loves to entertain and perform in front of people with his jumped skills and Se and Fi as an ESFP performer, when he does his triple jump in some games he puts his hands up in the air like he just performed in front of people in a stage show or play he's in with the impression he's trying to show his jumping skills off to people and entertain them and perform in front of them and impress them with his great jumping skills and abilities he has with his Se. Any type can love physical activity and be good a doing physical things and like physical things too, including Ne users, but Mario clearly is a Se dom here with loving to pay attention to respond to all details around him with his Se and living fully in the moment with it too and just caring for reacting to details today only and not focusing on the past or future very much at all.

Mario is also very adaptable with his Se being in the moment, he can adapt to any weather and new details he has to respond to in the sensory environment with his Se and he reacts to all details around them and pays attention to all details around him easily while respond to them quickly and spontaneously in the moment without fail with his Se dom behavior all the time no matter what terrain or situation he's in or presented with. He's a plumber again and uses a hammer, this is the perfect hands on image of Se and Mario's character. He's a very hands on Se dom and ESFP that follows his heart and jumps and performs and reacts and responds to details fully in the moment and doesn't really care about the future too much with his inferior Ni and just goes with the flow with his Se and focuses on what's going on fully in the moment and what's going on today as well and takes life day by day with his Se in general in each game he's always in. Some of the best games Mario has been in is Super Mario RPG, and Paper Mario series along with the great classic platformer Mario games we know and love today like the masterpiece game of Super Mario Bros. 3 and Super Mario Odyssey too along with many others like Galaxy and Mario 64.

Mario is the classic ESFP and one of the greatest ESFP characters of all time. ESFP is the best personality type for a platformer game series and a jumpman plumber, which is what he was named and called initially as Jumpman first haha, who uses a hammer to hit things and fight with his hands on Se that responds to all details around him in the moment, Miyamoto hit the mark and made the best ESFP game character ever clearly here with Mario and we thank him so much for the genius idea and creation he made with this amazing character and game series he created and invented for us, thank you Shigeru Miyamoto for everything. Everyone knows Mario around the world so I don't need to explain this. Feel free to share your opinion on this down below on what you think, if your curious on the other major characters, I type Bowser ESTJ, Princess Peach ESFJ, Princess Daisy ENFP, Luigi ISFJ. I can do more later on like the Paper Mario series and Super Mario RPG posts in depth at a later date. In short I type Mallow INFP btw and Geno INTJ.

- I was going through bad times and was more isolated from people
- I felt bad for letting out my emotions as it would make me look weird and too sensitive 

I did the 16personalities test as the person i wanted to be instead of who i was
Years later i got more into mbti and read a lot about it then realised i probably was ESFP.

ESFP,"Understanding which environments your personality and behavior is most suited for can be a tricky thing. So many of us are stuck in roles that require us to perform functions that aren‚Äôt completely in our wheelhouse instead of playing to our strengths.

The DISC Personality Theory showed me that I, and everyone else, have a natural predisposition for certain work environments and job functions. It‚Äôs always better to play to your strengths rather than try to compensate for your shortcomings.

Each person‚Äôs type is generally based on how outgoing or reserved they are, and how people-oriented or task-oriented that are.

There are 4 specific types under the DISC model

* Dominant
* Influence
* Supportive
* Conscientious

ESFP,"Ive thought I was an entp for a pretty long time, but recently one of my friends said that she saw me as more of an esfp. She said she mostly figured it out by thinking I have te and fi instead of ti and fe and then after thinking about it we realized that I have a lot of se and overall put it together and decided that I must be an esfp. Im still not 100% sure that we're right, but for now im going with it. Anyways I was wondering how I possibly mistyped as entp for so long since they're not super similar.

ESFP,"Hi, so bit of a confusing title for this sorry but I didn't know how else to word it.

Ive not been into MBTI for that long but consistently test ESFP and the descriptors for the type suit me. Only thing I get caught up on is Fi ...which is important for an esfp right?! But I score high on function tests for FE and often see myself as having FE but Im wondering if I'm not looking at it right and its harder to look at yourself sometimes I think.

I am always atuned to how other people are feeling, I worry about how comfortable they feel and don't want to upset anyone. I'll be honest with others always but try and do it in a really fluffy tactful way as to not make them feel attacked. The whole morals/principles part of Fi isn't something I can pin down....what are your morals/principles...what does this mean for you?

I DONT think everything is either good or bad and Ive often been accused of sitting on the fence, purely because I can sympathise with both sides a lot of the time and would rather respect each others differences.

I guess the only time I really see Fi in myself is as a mother. I am so empathatic to the feelings of children and do not like harsh punishment, leaving to cry etc (not looking to debate this as its not the point). But yeah, when it comes to kids I can get very Fi, this is what i believe in and i feel strongly that x, y and z are wrong. I'll then try and evidence my feelings on these matters to try and put out a message to others. 

anyway if you got this far into my rambling let me know what you think...what is Fi for you? what are some good ways to differentiate between the two? I just want to once and for all know that I have this function so i can feel comfortable thinking of myself as an esfp.",1596871398

ESFP,"(Sorry if this is long, being concise is not a strong suit) 

So I‚Äôve consistently never tested as anything other than ESFP-A over the last decade or so. I feel like I‚Äôm experiencing a sort of ‚Äúimposter syndrome‚Äù with being an ESFP though, mostly because of how practical and methodical I am. Does anyone else see their personality manifest in these ways?: 

Relationships: I get along with my INTJ boyfriend VERY well. I know practicality is a hallmark of ESFPs, but I feel like I plan plan plan like no other, which isn‚Äôt very typical of this type, but really helps in my relationship. We often face a disconnect on empathy (I‚Äôm a huge empath) but we mesh really well when it comes to being ‚Äúobsessive‚Äù about weird/nerdy things, and when getting things done together. I also tend to be very loyal in relationships, though I jump very quickly into a new one when they end (I ‚Äúbounce back quickly‚Äù).

Events/life goals: I‚Äôm a chatterbox, willing to speak my mind on anything, and very comfortable improvising. However I often spend hours researching, preparing, and organizing for any event, trip, or life goal - is this typical of ESFPs?! Sometimes my planning is mobilized as socially-driven (I‚Äôll plan impeccable events, holidays, vacations for people) or experience-driven (I want to order the *best* thing from a new restaurant), but often I feel like I have a non-stop almost domineering desire to plan out my life and next steps. If I want something, (a relationship, a friendship, a job) I‚Äôm impatient, so I immediately jump into gear to get on a path for that ‚Äúthing‚Äù. Does anyone else relate to this? 

School/career: I was a precocious child and have always been exceptionally good at school and work. Despite a low-income background, I managed to get multiple degrees from prestigious schools, and I do analytical research for a living, where I leverage my charismatic energy to ‚Äúsell‚Äù my analyses and conclusions. Yet I never seem to see other ESFPs in these roles, and people are always surprised when I say I‚Äôm ESFP (I‚Äôve literally never met another ESFP in school or work).

TLDR; I‚Äôm overly practical, forward-looking, booksmart, ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù, analytical, and constantly planning things. I ALWAYS test as an ESFP, and I feel like one socially, but I can‚Äôt help but feel like I‚Äôm not ‚Äútypical‚Äù for this type.

ESFP,"Those of you ESFP‚Äôs that have kids, how would you describe yourself as a parent and how old are your kids now and do you suspect/know MBTI for them?

14 (INFP), 12 (INFJ), 3 (have no idea yet)

I would say that I am a very different parent to my younger kids than I am now with teens. Little kids really stress me out and I found it difficult to not feel a bit stifled by little kids. My sense of freedom was screaming but I am also a SAHM, so maybe if I had been working during this time or had a spouse that didn‚Äôt work long hours it wouldn‚Äôt have been so hard?  

I now stress that I am too lenient with teens. I want to have fun with them, I don‚Äôt really like to force them to do many chores, I encourage them to go have fun with friends, and I just grant them maybe way too much freedom. I talk with them about everything and want them to trust me with their inner world and to know they could tell me anything and I wouldn‚Äôt freak out or judge them. I want them to fully experience life and choose their paths and happiness and I just want to be a cheerleader but sometimes I wonder if I need to be stricter?  I never have a clue. I feel like I‚Äôm guessing all of the time but I LOVE having teens and I love their world but I want to make sure they are being taught all of the things that will help them be successful in life. I demand they get an education, but after that I just want them to be happy with whatever life they choose. I am fairly good at mood swings, I totally have my own mood swings, so I am able to brush it off when the kids have them. I can have a bit of a fiery temper when a trigger happens but I am very quick to apologize or I am able to excuse myself and have my temper tantrum on my own. 

Also, it‚Äôs been interesting having such introverted and cautious kids while my husband (ENTP) and I are sooooo extroverted and I am a wild woman haha. I‚Äôve had to learn their language and realize when I can‚Äôt push them and when they need to recharge but it‚Äôs been a massive learning curve for me.

I have always been analitycal person and was thinking a lot, so that for me was just another confirmation that i had a strong Ti, since its not a problem for me to see things how they work and then proceed with my work or whatever (my undestanding of Ti atleast).

It was evident for me from the start that i can click with people really fast and that i have certain ""things"" or parts of myself that i cant let go or forget them, but i cant really call them values, more like innocent parts of myself that i dont wanna change, like ever. And was mad at world/people for some time because i just couldnt be what i am, and kinda forced to change myself to be noticed/do stuff/get things, but it got over it. I think. 

And in competitive world that we live in phrases like ""Make something out of yourself"" just make me pissed and im like ""stfu"" lol. Usually Fi is described as inner morals (?) (whatever the fuck that means), so ive always thought of Fi people as mushy, moral kinda hippie crowd, and that definitely didnt resonate with me, since im male that grew up in environment where being tough and strong is desireable. I can charm people really easily and im usually straight to the point which is also an ESTP trait AFAIK.  But lately this idea that i might actually be strong ""feeler"" is changing my perspective but i still dont quite know what is the difference between ESFP and ESTP besides usual logic vs moral bullshit that people cant really explain right.

Gon MBTI - Gon Freecss is ENFP

Gon Freecss MBTI is ENFP - Hunter x Hunter MBTI

The thought the ESFP reddit would be interested and intrigued with my Gon Freecss ENFP argument here. I repost this old post I made to a few places and forums already and thought you guys would like this too. I‚Äôm very interested in your opinions and would like people to objectively  share their opinions down below without personal feelings coming into play with your liking of the character of other reasons that might cloud accurate judgement. Tell me what you think objectively and personally on the ENFP vs ESFP debate here, I would like to see if you guys agree with my ENFP points here for Gon and my arguement why I type him so since I think he gets confused a lot with you guys which is understandable.

I posted this Gon Freecss ENFP post and argument I made a long time ago on the MBTI reddit and I'm really proud of it and love this post as a result through the years, I feel I fixed a lot of misconceptions people have with Gon's type and character with this and showed here how he uses Ne all the time, uses Si way more often than Se but still struggles with Si too to be an Si inferior user and acts very NF and is extremely idealistic as a character and NF as well in Hunter x Hunter. So I thought like I did a long time ago with my Goku ENFP repost from reddit that I did a long time ago, that I would post this one as well. Thanks for the support and feel free to share your opinions down below.

Here's a Myers-Briggs post of why Gon is ENFP with just developed sensing, particularly developed Si and is actually an Ne user and uses Ne all the time and is a Ne dom for sure as an ENFP and Si user to over Se which Gon doesn't use much of at all in the series actually. Hope you enjoy this Hunter x Hunter MBTI - Myers-Briggs typing post, share your thoughts and opinions on my Gon Freecss MBTI analysis down below.

So I decided I'm rewatching Hunter x Hunter again recently, and I haven't watched it in awhile but I know Gon's character and know he's ENFP and an Ne user with developed introverted sensing to help him survive in the Hunter world he's in. I'm going to write posts down below on why Gon Freecss is ENFP with just developed sensing but still Ne the whole series. I'm only on episode 2 on my rewatch right now, so I'm only gonna bring up a few points but even after 2 episodes I have perfect examples of his Ne and him being ENFP in the show, its already that obvious already so I'm gonna explain that down below. I'm going to update this post overtime as I watch the series so look forward to more content on why Gon is ENFP and uses Ne in the future, thanks.

Gon starts off the series heading off to be a hunter after catching the lord of the sea and his stepmom Mito tries to convince him not to be a hunter because the world is dangerous and his father left him for the hunter life instead of raising him. Gon proceeds to tell Mito isn't that amazing for him to do that and leave his son to be a hunter, it must be that amazing. Gon displays here that he's the type to at times ignore realistic facts thrown at him and instead be idealistic and give people chances and the benefit of the doubt to consider the possibilities of why Ging left in the first place, he completely ignores Ging's hurtful actions and gives him a chance anyway, these are traits of ENFPs giving everyone a chance and Ne considering possibilities with people giving them the benefit of the doubt before judging them. Then he proceeds to say I don't know what the world is like and says he wants to know more about the world and why Ging left and where he is, he showcases Ne curiosity in this scene and wants to see the world and discover why Ging left and his location in the world, this is pure curiosity about the future and what's out there.

Gon then uses Ne and Si on the ship to predict the storm. I'm going to be comparing this storm scene from the manga and anime and revising this part of my post since I did more research in the coming months up till now and have an even better understanding of the functions up to this point. So in the manga in chapter 2 Gon actually predicted the 2nd storm because there was two storms coming and that came in the manga where as the anime only showed one storm and had him predict that one. This obviously highlights his Ne because he's making a prediction and sees a possibility that will happen and believes in it, and further evidence of why he believes in his hunch of a big storm is coming in terms of the manga is he says the wind is tepid and salty and that the sea cranes are yelling out warnings, which showcases Gon's Si. Gon we can clearly interpret in this scene has been through this experience before with a big storm coming and these signs coming up, he remembers these conditions being met in his memory and their happening again which makes him able to make a confident prediction of a huge storm is coming and even predict the size of the storm and time frame it will hit when the captain asks him.

This is all clearly signs of Si and Ne in Gon with remembering past experiences and seeing the conditions and circumstances of those past experiences arising again to be able to make a confident prediction that something will happen soon and is coming, Si and Ne coming out in Gon clearly in this scene. I'm glad I was able to fix this point in this post and understand it properly after more research on the functions because this scene always confused me I'll admit but I go it down now. And in terms of the anime, the scene in general plays out the same except without going into more detail about the salty wind and it being tepid and the part of predicting the time and size, and of course Gon only predicts the first and the only one storm that happened in the anime. But my points still stand in the anime version and manga version despite the differences in how they played out. This is one of many moments you see Gon's good introverted sensing skills that help him as a hunter but he does have Se moments as well that I'll mention if you read on even if not as much, and of course there is plenty of Ne moments in Gon that I'll mention if you keep reading forward.

A perfect example of Gon using Si again that might go unnoticed for some people is also on the ship right after Kurapika and Leorio finish fighting. Gon stops the captain from yelling at them and telling them to comeback because Mito his aunt once told him, I'll again use the manga because the anime made some weird changes it worded it a little different, but the point still stands in the manga Gon tells us she said in the past to him: ""If you want to know a person, find out what makes him angry."" Gon states this is one of Aunt Mito's favorite sayings and then says they're both mad about something, we should leave them to work it out. This shows Gon is the kind of person more than most people to really treasure the past in terms of things that are meaningful and that he takes certain values and things he was taught in the past very seriously even now at his current age and time on the ship and that he doesn't forget these important values from the past. Gon showcasing he's the type of person to remember and treasure important values he was taught in the past further showcases his developed inferior Si as an ENFP, which is also similar to Luffy and Shanks with Luffy's actions in the bar scene in Jaya as an interesting parallel I noticed in Gon and Luffy here just to bring that up to compare. Luffy from One Piece is an obvious ENFP as well in my opinion and is very similar to Gon and has this similar parallel of treasuring values from the past and following till the end in current day in their lives. I could bring up more obvious parallels from other characters like Goku naming Gohan after Grandpa Gohan and putting the 4 star Dragon Ball on his hat, Luffy obsessing over no one ever damaging his Straw Hat and so on, but I think you get the point I'm getting at here by now reading this far so I'll move onto the next point. Again Gon's motivation to see Ging is Ne, he wants to find him to find more information about why he left him to be a hunter, the common desire in Ne users for exploration and information gathering based on curiosity caused by their Ne and what the function values. This curiosity for information from his Dad about his motivation drives Gon the entire series.

But a perfect scene where you see how this is Gon's (Si) at work is when he's able to tell those giant rabbit guys apart by paying attention to their details and remembering how the other looked from memory and being able to compare them based on that memory and tell them apart (Si). Gon's developed Si is very interesting in this scene since Leorio couldn't tell them apart and he's an Si user as well which goes to show how experienced Gon is in the wilderness and shows his potential as a Hunter. Keep reading because the best part I have for Gon being ENFP and using Ne is written down below, it's literally the perfect scene.

Another major Si moment in Gon is when he drank the poison drink made by Tonpa and given to him and his friends during the early exams. Gon starts drinking the juice and then stops immediately after tasting it and spits it out. He says I think this drink has gotten bad Tonpa, it tastes strange. He then tells Tonpa that he sampled and tasted plants and grasses back on his island and home in the past and because of that he knows and can tell when something tastes off and goes bad. This is perfect Si moment for Gon because he compared the taste of the drink to past experiences of tasting plants from his home town and island from him trying different plants back in the past when he was younger growing up on his island. He compared and contrasted those experiences and the tastes of those plants he once ate and consumed to the taste of the drink he drank right in that moment. And also he was aware of his body state at the touch of tasting the drink and his body told him this drink is bad and unsafe because of again the plants he tried and sampled on his island. So this whole poison drink scene was a major Si moment in Gon with him recognizing the poison based him tasting plants before on his island, so I just wanted to explain that here in depth since its such a major scene of Si for him.

Now this next scene is shows major amount of proof Gon is ENFP and an Ne user, I'm surprised people missed this since this is such prime example of his Ne being used in the series, all the way back in episode two. If you haven't guessed its the two question quiz scene, now let me explain why Gon uses Ne here and this is the perfect scene for showing he's ENFP. Leorio proceeds to get mad because the right answer is subjective and that picking either choose is immoral because you should love each person the lady makes you have to choose from, this is a question you should struggle with if your a decent good person, which we see is the case with the three characters here. Kurapika explains to Leorio after they're done silence was the right answer, you weren't supposed to choose since it'd be immoral to quickly pick between the two and would be a struggle.

Now after the quiz is over and everyone is ready to move forward, Gon is still thinking about the answer to the question and the possible scenarios! He takes a breath and sits there confused because he can't find the right answer, Leorio tells him they found the right answer and the quiz is over and you can stop now Gon, let's go now and move forward! Gon says I know the quiz is over but why should I stop thinking about the answer? He then proceeds to explain what if I run into that situation in the future and I can only save one person? He asks what should I do? It wouldn't right to pick only one of them but one day I might have to make that hard choice if the situation arises in the future suddenly one day. Extroverted intuition is about ""What If and What could be"" and all the possible scenarios in a situation, Extroverted Sensing is about ""What is and the here and now"" and how to handle a current situation presented to me completely now in the moment. An Se user in this scene would have struggled with the question like the rest did but once they heard the right answer would have been relieved and said good we found the right answer so now let's move forward. Gon literally continues to think about the possible scenarios and tries think of all the possibilities in this situation and find in an answer because he knows it's possible this scenario might possibly happen in the future and he should be prepared for it and think of all the possible options to handle it if it comes up. The old lady literally states that is the purpose of this test, you must be ready to face all the worst possible scenarios that may come your way in life because they may come out of nowhere without you expecting it in the future and that's literally what Gon does in this scene, considers all the possible options of the future in this scenario (Ne). This is a complete perfect example of Ne and extroverted Intuition in Gon and showcases why Gon is an ENFP. I rest my case, now on to the next part.

I'll keep adding more examples as the show progress on my rewatch, but yeah I just wanted to clear up why Gon is not ESFP and why he is actually ENFP with just developed introverted sensing to help him survive in the crazy world he's been born into and to maintain his occupation and survive in the future as he grows Hunter, this is a series where you need sensing to survive, even for the most intuitive characters like Gon and Killua, an ENFP and INTP, and his Se is also strong as well but his Si is much stronger and shows up way more often in the story and series.
___
I have more to add now since I've gotten further on my rewatch. Episode 12 is a perfect example of Gon's Ne as well. When they got to the crossroads on picking the long and easy short path, they didn't have enough and were forced to fight to figure out who were gonna be the two people left behind and which three we're gonna move forward. Gon paid attention to the weapons and them hitting the walls and this sparked an idea to use them to help their situation. Gon's Ne saw the possibilities in the moment and gave him the idea to use the weapons to break down the wall in the long path to make a shortcut to the short, his Ne generated that possibility in his mind on the spot and gave them the answer to pass everyone and not leave anyone behind. That's literally what Ne is, thinking about all the possibilities in a situation and assessing all the options possible in the future, Gon does this perfectly in this scene and episode as well along with my other examples mentioned before. This a second prime example of Gon's Ne, further proving why he's ENFP and how he uses Ne in the series.

Some more Ne moments of Gon is he comes up with Jajaken and he comes up with the idea to trick the Chimera Ant with the multiple arms by calling out a different Rock, Paper, Scissors attack than the one he actually used, just like kid Goku did to Jackie Chun back in Dragon Ball.

I've gotten even further and have more to say and have evidence to oppose Gon's use of Se, and have proof that he doesn't use it in the series from a weakness I found, further showcasing how he uses Ne more.

When Gon steals the badge from Hisoka, when he runs off he gets attacked by the black hunter guy with glasses. After he snipes him and knocks Gon over he proceeds to tell Gon he could have killed him thousands of times because he wasn't paying attention. He tells Gon he doesn't pay attention to his surroundings which is why he was able to snipe him and attack him like that and take his badge. This showcases Gon doesn't have Se dominant and his sensing isn't as strong as it seems even if in the series its decently developed, further showcasing Gon uses Ne much more instead and isn't very good at paying attention to his surroundings.

Gon asks a lot of Ne curiosity questions all the time too since Ne users ask a lot of questions a lot in their life because of Ne curiosity seeing possibilities and wondering and imagining about everything they see in the world and with the people they meet. Killua even mentions this trait in Gon is useful when he says ""It's good to have some around who's not afraid of always questions."" Killua says this trait is good and useful in Gon when they try to runaway from Phinks and the Phantom Troupe guys right after the YorkNew City Arc ends and there at the auction and accidentally see them again right after being let go by them in the exchange for getting Chrollo back from them for Gon and Killua as a trade between two hostages during the arc.

Gon used Ne and Si when he was training to predict where birds will be in the future with their movements to catch them. He focused and remembered their movement patterns with his Si and was trying to predict in the future of where they'll end up being based on remembering and memorizing their moving habits. This is the Ne and Si axis. Gon also sees a bird catching a fish and pays attention to it. He sees the bird catch the fish and remembers it and thinks about it and then when he sees another bird catch a fish he comes up with the idea on how to catch the bird, with it being going for the target the second if goes for its prey, another Ne Si moment in Gon once again. And the entire time he wasn't paying to attention to his surroundings that the black hunter comments about when he's shown hiding behind the bushes showing his low Se and rather Gon living in his own world with his Ne fully out of touch with reality while he focused on practicing to predict where the birds will be. Gon also came up with the idea with his Ne on to use the butterfly's to track Hisoka after remembering with his Si the detail of Hisoka being injured earlier in the past.

Some more content as I continue to watch more of the series:
Back in the cave with the snakes Gon believes in his hunch that the antidote is definitely there in the dead guy's clothes even if there is not much evidence it is there. He sees the possibility the antidote is there for sure even if there's a chance its not there at all.

The appraiser guy assess Gon and his character, he says in his head Gon is a boy who approaches things with pure curiosity, he doesn't judge things or people too fast as good or bad he says. He highlights pure curiosity is Gon's unique attribute, that's a clear sign of Ne and Extroverted Intuition as well in Gon.

Another Ne moment in Gon is when he says he had a hunch on how the selection for the players for Greed Island worked when they were waiting in the stands to start and get picked for the Greed Island game and participate. Killua was over analyzing the situation and the guy behind him told him how it worked and said how Gon predicted this ahead of time. Gon says yes to this and confirms he was trusting his hunch of how the selection for Greed Island was going and he trusted his hunch and focused on controlling his Nen to get ready for his turn the whole, this a major Ne moment in Gon and shows him relying on his hunches and intuition yet again for his decision making for a problem and situation that came up for them to handle and try to figure out so that they can keep moving forward with their goals as usual.

So I have some examples now for inferior Si. The biggest example of this is like one of the examples I mentioned above of Gon noticing and telling the big rabbits guy's apart from observing them and remembering what one looked like and comparing one from memory to another, this is (Si) in a nutshell. Gon's Si is a strength and weakness since its very developed but still the last function he uses in the inferior function slot. Gon is not good with details and not good with remembering detailed information. I'm on the Greed Island arc and you see this trait of him when Gon gets confused with all the information of the dodgeball game coming at him, he gets confused and flustered easily with too many details and information. I remember this happening plenty of other times when Gon spaced out, was confused, and puzzled when heavy information was being throw at him throughout the series and his brain gets fried and smoke comes out of his ears. This happens also with the Knuckle explanation, along with the other moments in the series.

The Genthru scene is also a huge Ne moment, since Gon mentions how he has to be selfish in this situation in his mind to Bisky and proceeds to go after a chance he sees to injure Genthru. Gon sees a possibility to attack Genthru and cause major damage to him but its a huge risk, Gon doesn't care and focuses on the idea because he sees the possibility to carry out this idea and he wants to do whatever he can to make this possibility come to fruition, even if there's a chance he'll lose both his arms and life in the process.

My last points will be a few Ne moments that happened that I'll summarize from the Chimera Ant arc and idealism Gon showed in the arc as well. Gon shows Ne a few times this arc and I'll just mentioned two moments here. When the falling arrows come down onto the castle and then they charge in, they start running towards the stairs in that famous scene and Youpi sees them. They didn't expect the arrows to come down and just had to go with the flow and keep running and stick to the plan everyone thought in their mind but Gon has a Ne moment that nobody else sees here. He thought of the possibility ahead of time of what if Knuckle and the Chameleon guy got hit and we're dead on the ground still invisible? They didn't know the limit of his invisible powers so its was still possible, and if that possibility existed and happened then who was gonna fight Youpi if this series of possibilities happened? Gon realized all of this in an instant and instantly ran towards Youpi from the start assuming this happened and knew if these what if scenarios happened that he or someone had to deal with Youpi and he chose to go for it despite the risk and uncertainty, this a huge Ne moment in Gon and its scene that should be recognized and understood properly since its such a huge Ne moment so I hope I helped make it clear. Now the next one is Kite, Gon the entire arc sees the possibility to save Kite with his Ne, he blames himself and gets hung up on the past with his Si and he feels he's the reason Kite was captured and lost his arm. Despite all this and him regretting being there holding him back and causing that incident he hopelessly believes no matter what that Kite can be saved. No matter how unrealistic it seems or what facts get presented to him and hints that Kite can't make it, is dead, or can't be saved, he doesn't believe it until the very end when he brings Pitou with him to see and try to fix Kite anyway. Gon is idealistic about saving Kite this entire arc and doesn't listen to anyone or realism this entire time in the arc and even explodes at Killua for being level headed and telling Gon to stop at different times. He stays focused on the goal and his massive amounts of idealism for saving Kite no matter what and ignore any pratical or logical points that goes against his idealism and hope in the entire arc. It doesn't take until they finally get there to Kite and Pitou says Kite can't be saved that Gon finally breaks down and snaps and you already know the rest of what happens from there. So yeah, that's all my points for Gon being ENFP and my Ne and Si points for him so far for this post at least.

Here's also a separate opinion and post that highlights the correlation of Nen types and categories and MBTI types as well and common personality MBTI characteristics that correlate with them and the different Nen types in Hunter x Hunter. It's a really great and awesome post and I highly recommend you check it out here down below. I think the poster did a really good job with this overall even I disagree with a few character typings here and there. The character MBTI types I do agree with that they typed here are Gon Freecss ENFP, Killua Zoldyk INTP, Kurapika INTJ, and I disagree but type Leorio ESFJ like most people do but we both at least agree Fe dom, and Hisoka is ENTP in my opinion and many others as well. Some others are also I personally type Chrollo INFJ list most and Franklin ISFJ but I'll stop there since this part will go on forever. Overall 3 of the main characters I agree with and Leorio and Hisoka are close to my opinion of them as well as Fe dom EXFJs and NTPs as well, that's similar enough to match with the Nen types and MBTI typings pairing anyway so its fine really. Anyways check out the post down below, its really great and well written and really well though out too:

\------

This was my description for the poll (don't attack me. it's something i genuinely struggle with and am trying to fix):

When a semi attractive person acts kind of nice to me one time, I romanticize it until I fall in love with the idealized version of them in my own mind and not actually who they are in real life. Then I get to know them more and after I fall ""out of love"", I cringe and I'm like - why did I ever like this person? I must have been insane. And it was because I had fallen in love with the idea of someone they could be that they actually weren't but I was just blinded by my romanticized view of them to see the reality of who they were.

It happens to me so often that for almost all of my past ""crushes"", I'm cringing and thinking to myself - how could I have ever liked this person?

ESFP,"I‚Äôve been feeling like I was hitting a wall with my productivity and development until I recently came across this wonderfully simple concept called the 5 Hour Rule. No matter how busy successful people are, they always spend at least an hour a day ‚Äî or five hours a work week ‚Äî learning or practicing. And they do this across their entire career.

The 5 Hour Rule has been traced all the way back to Benjamin Franklin, who was constantly setting aside time to learn each day. It‚Äôs also been embraced by several leaders like Bill Gates, Warren Buffett and Oprah.

The rule has been broken down into 3 buckets that learning takes place through:

* Reading: Investing in a reading habit can, expectedly, help you grow each and every day
* Reflection: Taking the time to assess what you‚Äôve learnt and how you can get better will set you up for success in the future
* Experimentation: Experiments show you what‚Äôs working and where you need to improve.

recently i talked to a guy that knew a lot about mbti so he could help me bc i‚Äôve been, for almost 3 years, trying to type me (i mistyped a lot) and could never get to a conclusion bc my sense of self is horrible. i‚Äôm not even sure if he‚Äôs right, or if i‚Äôm really an esfp but the functions do make sense

if you try to type me by general descriptions (with that i mean without looking at the functions) of mbti i guess you would probably think i‚Äôm an istp or intp, maybe isfp

there is this stereotype that esfps are ‚Äúdumb‚Äù but since i was young i‚Äôve been pretty good at school. always got good grades, loved math (still love now), i was also pretty quiet. i learned how to read when i was 5 without help from anyone, one day i just read the activities on the page that was open on my book and finished all of them and my teacher was so shocked that she sent me to the school administration office and told the principal to call my parents SSKDJKSKS i still remember that day. we never understood how i learned, but my mom made the theory that it was probably bc of ‚Äúxuxa‚Äù, a brazilian singer who used to sang kids songs lmao (i‚Äôm brazilian)

i‚Äôve always been shy too, when i ask people their first impression of me they always say they found me shy. also i‚Äôm not the most talkative in my group of friends, irl and on the internet. i actually leave the messages without reading/replying for hours, idc about answering right on time. i‚Äôm even known for ‚Äúdisappearing‚Äù KDJDKSKJ

also there is the stereotype of ‚Äúparty people‚Äù... i do like parties but i‚Äôm really not the life of the party, i‚Äôm actually kinda awkward dancing :/

ESFP,"hi!
so i‚Äôm 18, male, and an esfp-t. so i know it‚Äôs an issues with our personality (i just recently discovered what esfp‚Äôs are and i thought they just completely analyzed my personality lol) but how do i find myself a person? i know this is bad of me to say but i feel bored of people and i sometimes feel like they‚Äôre not worth my time. i will hang out with a potential pan (we usually hookup and hangout) and in the moment i like them, but as soon as i get home, i think ‚Äúthey‚Äôre nice, but they‚Äôre really not it‚Äù. i‚Äôve had only a few guys make me feel butterflies and i don‚Äôt want to be an ass, but it seems like they really start falling in love with me. i just recently started realizing that i‚Äôm not awful looking, i workout, i get a long with a lot of people, but they‚Äôre just never it for me. i have never felt like nervous and anything in front of someone like that but they‚Äôre usually nervous. i want to feel butterflies. i feel awful that i get bored so easily but it‚Äôs just that i hang out with them and i kind of find out their personality and realize it‚Äôs not for me. what do i do?",1594573785
ESFP,"I‚Äôve had a hard time learning new things. Concepts often seem to go over my head and I rarely ever recall what I thought I learnt. Over time, I realized that it was because I never truly understood what I was learning.

The Feynman technique is particularly effective at helping you master difficult concepts. Named after the Nobel Prize winning Richard Feynman, the concept focuses on explaining a difficult concept in easy to understand language as if you were explaining it to someone else (or a child). By following the Feynman technique, you might just end up learning difficult concepts quickly, spend less time studying, and remember concepts longer.

The four steps are as follows:

1. Write the concept down
2. Explain it using simple language
3. Address (look up) problematic areas or questions that remain
4. Challenge yourself to simplify it further

I have found this to be a powerful concept that helps you cut study time shortly. The push to understand and explain a concept forces you to identify areas where you have a gap in your understanding. I‚Äôve broken this down even further here - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RleSyp16lLE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RleSyp16lLE). I definitely recommend giving this a shot with something new that you are learning. As always, figure out what works best for you!",1594485827

ESFP,"Hi!

Personabilities has created a new personality test called Intellabilities. It measures not the level but the range of your intelligence. It's kind of like a cross between MBTI and StrengthsFinder. The test takes 10-15 minutes to take and afterwards you'll get a 40 page report (free) on your intelligence abilities and personality. It will show you what specific abilities you have, what fields of study you should pursue (as in specific college majors), and what careers would be best for you.

[https://personabilities.com/#/](https://personabilities.com/#/)

We're curious if there's a correlation between being an ESFP and Intellabilities types. 

Maybe you'll all end up being Promoters but I hope some of you are different types as well. Either way you are probably all Trailblazers.

ESFP,"* I feel most myself thinking of things that I can do in the real world. I want to feel each day is worthwhile, with a new experience or a new adventure being possible. Something as simple as stargazing or going out skateboarding in a new area in town is the simple pleasure that I really live for.
* I like to be a comedian for others. Whether that‚Äôs starting to dance when a catchy song plays and making everyone laugh, or simply getting a smile out of people, I tend to be funny but not necessarily in the Ne random way but more-so accommodating others and being goofy at certain moments that allow me to.
* I‚Äôm very creative but I prefer my creativity to be tangible. I actually enjoy writing but I hate writing or reading things that consist of strange universes or alien planets, I love things that have a realistic implication, a story about a real life situation or The Hunger Games which is a realistic dystopia instead of a random planet. A lot of my creativity involves the 5 senses. I love to paint for the sight, dance to feel one and immersed with my body and music, sing to make sounds, and I‚Äôm a pretty good cook even if I don‚Äôt enjoy the tediousness of it at times.
* Without sensory experiences I tend to feel very empty. Whenever traveling I look for places to waterski or surf, or anything like a place that has karaoke night. I believe that doing fun things like this with my friends makes life so much more enjoyable than boring museums or just looking at places and not doing anything.
* I have very strong morals and I tend to shut down when I see people imposing them. I tend to treat everyone as an individual deserving of the same respect. I am very observant to people‚Äôs emotional states and make an effort to make everyone feel included.
* I‚Äôm very good at knowing how I feel and I might sometimes be very aware and sensitive if I‚Äôm being left out. I tend to use these emotions as self expressions and an outlet for creativity. My inner world is the source for my outer expression.
* I am described as affable and childlike. I tend to wave my hand frantically with eagerness at someone I know across the street, and enjoy random small talk and conversation with anyone I know whenever I can get it.
* I can be very goal oriented and look to the outer world as a guide to becoming better. I tend to measure myself based on external standards such as goals or discipline when it comes to the things I‚Äôm passionate about. I tend to have a desire to be the best I can be at my passions and work to get there. But I‚Äôm pretty lazy most of the time, haha.
* I suck at math and I absolutely can‚Äôt stand lectures. When teachers allow us for us to do group work, to be creative with our work and to apply the learning to something I can actually use in my life, I feel really happy and immersed into the subject.
* Is this inferior Ni? I hate when people ask me where I see myself in ten years. What I‚Äôm preoccupied with is the experiences I can have now or in the short term future. I don‚Äôt know what I want to do or where I want to be, and it stresses me out. I notice I tend to think of the future in terms of relationships. For example: I want you as my friend in the future, I want this relationship to be our future. But I tend to stop there and when I do think of the future it‚Äôs when I‚Äôm unhealthy and thinking: The future is doomed, the worst outcome is going to happen, the future is going to screw me over. And in these moments I tend to act withdrawn, reclusive, and very aloof, opposite of what I usually am.

What makes me lean towards not being an ESFP:

&amp;#x200B;

* I‚Äôm not a party person at all. I really don‚Äôt like to have shallow relationships and I search for meaningful connections with friends and others around me. I don‚Äôt have the obliviousness to connections and meaningful things the way the descriptions say so.
* I definitely can see the abstract meaning behind things and for example can see a relationship being like a flower starting from the dirt and growing out. But I don‚Äôt enjoy having abstract concepts all the time, I need a balance for the simple pleasures of life and analyzing the deep stuff.
* I tend to sometimes be aloof and guarded if I don‚Äôt fit in. Sometimes if I feel the people around me are immoral I tend to shut down and act as more of a quiet loner. I‚Äôm not an extrovert hundred percent the time but I‚Äôm very loud and outgoing when I feel comfortable.
* I've gotten pretty into MBTI which means I feel maybe my Ni is higher.  I've had a hard time typing myself and for some reason seem to lean between a mix of ENFJ and ESFP during tests with Ne being nonexistent. I feel that me wanting to know who I really am might make me an intuitive, but I personally feel being a sensor is way cooler.
* I can be unobservant and spacey.  I notice when I'm bored I tend to have mind fogs where I don't really notice anything around me. I tend to not notice the porch got swept and things being misplaced but I'm also engaged and in touch with fun activities like dancing. I don't really daydream but it's more of a mind fog that I find myself in when I'm bored or not fully engaged in something. It makes me feel like an Ne user especially since I can at times be told to pay attention and that I'm not really 'there', but then when I'm really enjoying something I feel really in tune and attentive to the world. I score very low on Ne, and my highest scores tend to be be Se and Fi with Te following and Ni and Fe following.

Are ESFPs like this at all, or this something unique to me?",1593922485
ESFP,,1593910061
ESFP,"This is version one. Give some feedback plz. I couldn‚Äôt find something like this online so here we go.   


* **Bacchus/Dionysians:**

Examples: various pop icons, Kardashians, actors, comedians, fighters, local drug dealers. 

This is where the party animal stereotype comes from. Fi-&gt;Te in the middle. They're animalistic and often draw a varied party regardless of if they want to. They know what they enjoy and they go after it. That's all. 

In their mind, they're just tryna make themselves happy and provide a service for people at the time. A great formula for life right? An issue may arise when their happiness takes precedence and they sour on the service part. They may ghost on a moments notice, try self-sabotage, find an easy route, or stabilize their service to provide a steady income if they're more mature. 

Fifty years ago they'd see all the shows at the theatre, drink the finest wine, and play a relaxing sport. Now... they just go on their phones all day... Though to be fair, who doesn't? 

Sometimes what they enjoy is not enjoying the stuff other people like. Dislikes are just as strong as likes. You'll see ESFPs who are punk rockers, who don't use social media, who are straight edge, never watched porn in their lives or who claim they don't like people. They almost live for infamy. This should be a whole section on its own...

Sometimes what they like is being a Paris Hilton, as we're all aware of. More mature Dionysians can visualize simulations of the near future and plan for it. They usually anchor their Fi to it. It's like this: If I can do a touch of Ni and not fuck myself over, then I can do all the Fi I want. Win-win. 

The same with all ExxPs, they'll burn everything down if you try to control them. Some can be seen as sellouts, as they want their cake, and to eat it too. Most of the time it's just good business. Some value entertaining overall: Justin Gaethje said he'd rather lose than have a boring fight. This encapsulates the Bacchus spirit in ESFPs. They'd rather win, but the idea of going the boring route for that... just no. 

Often mistaken for: ESTPs who have an inside joke that they don't care who gets. ENFPs who are less abstract or hippy-ish. ESFJs who aren't obsessed with people.  


* **Titan:**

Examples: popular ex-military dudes, actors, fitness dudes, firefighters, politicians. 

Fi is one of the most animalistic functions. One doesn't even need a reason to go after what they want. If they can tap into that single-minded Ni at the bottom and lock onto a goal they're unstoppable. Beings that keep going forward and never stop.

Known for those motivational videos on youtube where the guys shouting at you to get out of bed at three fifty-eight in the morning and tie your shoelaces. Your legs are broken? Good. Now get back on that elliptical. 

They'll go through hell and high water to achieve what they want. The issue being, if they're on the wrong path, they'll go through hell and high water to fall off a cliff. You're one on one against life playing Russian roulette for the holy grail. 

Think of it like the titans in ‚Äòattack on titan‚Äô, even the titan shifters. They see a goal, they go for it, that's it. They only vary on maturely that attack their targets. 

They're often less fearful of control as they know it's a necessary part to achieve your goals. More mature titans fear no man, as they're conscious that man is just a bag of flesh and blood. Therefore they can't fear man‚Äôs control and can bust out of it at a moments notice. 

Often mistaken for: Little more personable and little less tactical ENTJs \[easy to see how they dominate politics\]. ISTPs who care less about the preservation of their physical bodies.

  
***Background info:*** *Background about me, I first thought I was an ESTP, then an xNTP before settling on ESFP a couple of years ago.  If there are any more variations you‚Äôve seen, lemme know. I‚Äôd like to add a more introverted variation, and would love to go into more depth regarding ""healthy and unhealthy"".*",1593870444

You probably already guessed and noticing some ESFP and ENFP confusion online since you guys look so alike from each other and everyone has their own opinions which is fine. But I wanted to do this today and share my personal opinion on anime characters that I see that are definitely ESFPs in my opinion and are great and amazing characters as well and very well written too. You guys complain for good reason that the MBTI community doesn't do you justice and stereotypes you guys too often and get prejudged a lot by stereotypes you guys are known for and I feel you.

Here are the other MBTI anime characters I made in the past, the INTJ one is my most recent one as of now:

So I wanted to do this post as a thanks for being awesome and discussion of what anime characters I think are ESFPs for sure and are great characters as well in the anime community. Now I'm gonna get this out of the way, I'll share my opinion on the big ones that people debate often for anime main characters that get debated ENFP vs ESFP in the community. In my opinion I type Goku, Gon Freecss, Luffy, and Naruto ENFPs, I feel they've shown Ne and Si each plenty of times to argue the case for each one and make the case for why their each individually ENFPs. That's my opinion though, if you agree or disagree feel free to share your opinions down below. I'll posts links to posts I've made on them or other people's post on them that I agree with if you want to see evidence for why I think so for each character. I personally see Ash Ketchum ENFP too but that's my opinion as well. Share your opinions down below again if you feel you want to or feel differently about something, I'll post the links down below. But this post isn't about them, it's about other characters that I see in my opinion as awesome ESFPs and great characters that people already know and love or need to talk about more and give more love and attention to and should recognize as awesome ESFP characters, alright enough with the essay I'll post my opinions down below now:

Now for the awesome characters I see as clear ESFPs in my opinion, here's my list of all them written out for you guys:

Awesome ESFP anime characters:

Kuwabara - This man is amazing and one of my favorite anime characters of all time. He's fantastic and relatable and very funny and down to Earth. He has a heart of gold and great morality and has a awesome dynamic between him and Yusuke who's ESTP. Kuwabara is sometimes mistyped ESFJ but no this man is ESFP for sure, he uses Se and Fi all the thime and he's an awesome ESFP anime character at that. Overall great character, gonna make a character analysis on him when the time comes when I get to rewatching Yu Yu Hakusho again.

Knuckle - Another great Kuwabara like character, made by Togashi again. Very manly and tough but has a soft side that the show often gets on him for and its very funny side to his character. Again heart of gold and great morality, he loves animals, he helps Gon out even though Gon got mad at him for it, haha. Knuckle is great what more do I need to say, he's an amazing character and one of Togashi's best.

Brook - One of the best straw hats from One Piece. One of the best characters in One Piece as well. Most people agree on this, he's amazing and extremely creative idea on Oda's part. He's a talking skeleton with an Afro with a extremely sad backstory but still keeps his sense of humor and is very down to earth as well. He loves to perform and make music and make people laugh and make jokes. He's more practical than Luffy which is a nice touch and is realistic and loyal to Luffy and Laboon. He make his own band and music artist career of sorts which is amazing and hilarious at the same time. He was incredible in the New World especially in the Big Mom arc, anyone that seen the arc knows what I'm talking about. It's Brook what more do I need to say, Soul King will live on forever.

Mina Ashido - One of the more newer ones, she's spontaneous and in the moment and loves to dance and party. She likes to break dance and get involved in class activities and likes to get everyone else involved as well in the fun. She's bright and energetic and full of life and has a interesting and unique design to her. Love Mina she's a great character and one of the best characters in class 1-A.

Joey Wheeler - Now where do I begin. This guy is a fantastic character and probably started the heart of gold ESFP stereotype first before among all of them. Joey is an awesome character with great morality and tons of funny humor to him as a character as well, its true he started off a bully to Yugi but once they changed and Yugi helped him he never left his side and stayed loyal to him till the end. Joey is great an amazing character and I always loved when he was on screen and the duels he was apart of in the series.

Ty Lee - from Avatar she's a rather interesting one. She seems one note at first and just attractive and all that initially. But as the series progressed we learn more about her and her backstory and learn to empathize with her more rather than our first initial impression of her in the beginning when they were around the campfire. She might not seem to important of a character among the cast to some people out of all the Avatar cast but I felt her character was done well enough to mention her here so here you go, Ty Lee is among the greats.

Asta - Another newer one from Black Clover. I think Asta is an interesting case for a character so far. I haven't gotten too far in Black Clover so I don't have too much to say about him but from what I've seen I'm starting to like his character more and can see his determination and drive to reach his goals and do whatever it takes to get to where he wants to be to be Wizard King. He's shaping up to be great and more interesting so I wanted to mention him here since I feel he deserved it and it was necessary.

Kirishima - One of the best characters in My Hero Academia. He's great and reacts to details around him very quickly and very well. Any type can fight in a physical way but in his case he does have a very physical fighting style is all about offense and defense with his hardness powers. He lives fully in the moment, reacts to details quickly and pays attention to his surroundings and details around him very well, he has strong inner values and is very emotional and has great morality and a heart of gold with his Fi and with his belief in manliness especially when someone does a good deed that he sees as moral and right. Despite his toughness he shows us his vulnerable side and emotions especially in his backstory, he looks up to his favorite hero and follows his philosophy and uses his values to be brave and to keep going. Sometimes is a bit impulsive with his Se but overall still a great character and I can't wait to see more from him as we all know and are looking forward too with his character. Red Riot will be a beast and awesome good hero. Here's a great post on Kirishima if you want to read more about him:

&amp;#x200B;

Mario - Super Mario, this is a video game character but I'll mention him here anyway. Where do I even begin, he's the biggest video game character in the world and his jumping and Se has changed the world forever in video game history. He follows his heart with his Fi and he lives to jump and perform for us as Jumpman for years to come in countless Mario games that we love to play no matter how many times we do it. His Se helps him jump and respond to details in the environment perfectly which is why he's the best debatably video game character ever made. It's Mario, he's awesome, we all now this. Let's love him and enjoy his character forever in all time.

Ino - The Naruto series isn't known for developing its characters the best out of the bunch but despite this Naruto is still a great series despite its flaws and I think Ino is still a great character among the cast. She bonded really well with her team, Shikamaru and Chouji. They make a really good team and she has an interesting dynamic and rivalry with Sakura. She had a lot of good in the Chuunin Exam forest and I believe had some great fights later as well from memory. Overall Ino is a great and solid character and I felt she should be mentioned here as well.

Forgive me if your a Fairy Tail fan, I'm gonna critique this one more. I don't think this next one is well written but I figured I'd mention him since he's popular:

Natsu Dragoneel, one of the weaker ones for sure. Not the most well written and one of the worst shonen characters in my opinion. If you like him that's fine, I'll respect your opinion of him. But Natsu is definitely ESFP and should be mentioned here anyway

Renji from Bleach, another great ESFP character

Sailor Venus, another awesome ESFP character

Black Star from Soul Eater, another great ESFP character again, haha

Majin Buu

Mr. 2 Bon Clay

Ivankov

Alvida from One Piece as well

Minoru Mineta

Yuga Aoyama

Mt. Lady

Present Mic

Scratchmen Apoo

ESFP,"Been dating an esfp. It‚Äôs been going very well. Never had a more genuine heart connection to someone before.

We both are older and have discussed our most recent dating experiences. Mainly, because he has asked me about mine. I have never asked about his dating past because...idk, it‚Äôs just not important to me. 

But on one occasion he started giving me his ‚Äúhistory‚Äù of exes and why it didn‚Äôt work. It was odd. Like he had to get it all out or something. 

I was confused and asked him, what I should take from this info? Should I read into this? He said no, I shouldn‚Äôt and he was telling me just to tell me. (Ok...)

The info wasn‚Äôt completely flattering to him (imo) as it sounded like he just went with people who liked him a lot. For instance he was with the latest ex because she ‚Äúreally liked him‚Äù and it ended because he realized he didn‚Äôt love her. 

The only person who he actively said he liked, he described as ‚Äúmean to everyone but him‚Äù and eventually that temper was what ended things.

I asked him if he even knew what he wanted. I told him I was easy going with building something but I was looking for something real and didn‚Äôt want my time wasted. Took him aback. 

He seemed oddly pleased with that answer but didn‚Äôt say anything more. Anyway, we‚Äôre going on a trip together, his idea. Cool! 

Maybe it‚Äôs my own insecurity - fair admit but on another occasion he showed me some vacation pics from his travels and just lots of these different exes in them. 

I guess it made me uncomfortable, even though it shouldn‚Äôt? Guess I felt like it took away from the trip we had planned- like he was low key telling me it wasn‚Äôt that special. Does this with everyone. 

Anyone shed light on this? Am I being weird here?? Lol. Dated a lot of people and never had someone be that open about their exes.",1593484388

ESFP,"Hello, guys!!!
A question has been bothering me that you may answer, I think: my MBTI type. I've been typed so many times as an ESFP or even an ENFP that my head hurts, and I'm still confused. Read descriptions, read accounts, could relate to Ne doms more, and didn't feel as though i am  more sensual Se dom like, I'm very very childish and flower power, ambiverted, plus a total airhead. I've been compared as a child to Belle, Angelina Jolie (who was a total role model for me) or Lara Croft, and nowadays to Melissa McCarthy in her various films, like Tammy being a great example, or to a puppy, to Hermione Granger or to the great Carrie Fisher. 

Is it because of the functions of a Se dom that I think I'm a Ne dom?? I'm actually very very unsure of how I work, because I don't remember what I do exactly, I always move on, although I've been told I can seem sometimes stuck and or unwilling to change, but that's a very very diffiicult subject which is pretty personal to me. I'm not sure what I do in times of stress. Sometimes I search for the loops and grips, but I don't really remember what I do. I had recently a very very unhealthy moment where I was afraid of the future, had this certain vision and I shut down, plus attacked people  INFJ-style by saying ""people are only dating and have friends because they don't know how else to raise/feed their self-esteem.


I feel as though I am very honest, sometimes not, that I know I subconciously have an image that I have to keep up with, although I feel like myself, I know how the world will react, even if I want total honesty and control, which may lead to my confusion over MBTI and feeling as though I never answered honestly. Plus not knowing my effing Enneagram.

Is ir possible that I am a more ENFP-ish Se dom? I just feel so down and I can't fit in no matter what description I read, so I figured I might just as well ask you guys. I can answer a lot of questions about me, in case.

Super ESFP, an immature one, nonetheless he will grow I‚Äôm sure. And for some reason people don‚Äôt think ESFP‚Äôs can be driven or have depth. So therefore they type him as the others once he gets serious. Haha.",1592862222

ESFP,"I have taken the 16p AND Dario personality tests and they both come back with strong ESFP.

I forgot to look at the other stuff though cause I was just trying to figure out where I belong lol.

My fianc√© is a hard ENFP and he just got this book about his personality and he really wants to know mine. So he can better understand how I think.

At first I thought I was a cusp of something between ESFP AND ENFP but now I see that they are particularly similar. However, there are a few things that trip me up, first is the relationships, yes I do have some flaky relationships and I HAVE hopped from one boyfriend to another but I now have found my other half. Like we literally call each other our twin. Maybe because we have a very open and honest relationship with each other and not to mention sex life is AMAZEBALLS. I digress...

The other thing that I have read was ESFP personality types aren‚Äôt that creative? But I am extremely creative (arts and crafts etc.) not at all a numbers or planning person and I DEFINITELY cannot see the bigger picture in anything and it really pisses my fianc√© off sometimes lol along with my constant forgetfulness. I also love cheesy dad jokes! Like this one:

What‚Äôs the difference between a hippo and a zippo lighter?

Ones a little heavy the other is a little lighter LOL

Also my fianc√© does always say that I don‚Äôt listen to him and that‚Äôs not true at all. I do, I just forget things. A lot. I also roast him quite a bit which he doesn‚Äôt like either lol but he takes it and even throws some back, but when he does it he usually attacks (or seems to me) my learning disability (dyslexia) it‚Äôs usually all in fun but deep down it does sting a little.

With jobs I have done various things in my life and have various degrees and certificates but none of them really brought me much joy, except for a sales job that I had but my boss was wicked chill and he knew my love language really well (words of affirmation). Something that I am interested in pursuing someday when all my other debt is paid off though is cosmetology because it‚Äôs like art, I can be creative. 

Another thing that didn‚Äôt totally match up is confrontation. I guess I do like to avoid confrontation with the people I care about as much as possible but if I don‚Äôt know you on a personal level or if I don‚Äôt care about you I have no problem getting into an argument or fist fight if you have hurt someone close to me. 

For example: If we are at the bar and my friend is being bothered by someone I will not hesitate to protect my friend, even if they don‚Äôt speak up about it and I can just tell by their body language. I have been in lots of fights this way and I don‚Äôt discriminate I WILL FIGHT YOU lol (I am female so no hate plz lol.) 

However, if I get in to an argument with my fianc√© (which RARELY happens) I always end up crying, and forget confrontation with my mom. I WILL not, it makes me extremely uncomfortable, I will agree with her on almost everything she says, even her extremely right wing political views (which not to mention I hate politics with a fiery passion.) I can be a little confrontational with my dad but he has always been in and out of my life so it‚Äôs kinda not the best relationship...

So I guess my question is... am I an ESFP?",1592747725

I like to keep my head down and get on with work (I work in a tech role), but find the gossiping and negative jibes around me get me down.

ESFP,"TL;DR - INTJ visiting looking for some help, or at least perspective, trying to make my marriage of 17 years with ESFP work.

Note: We have both had individual (frequently) and couple counseling (periodically) throughout our marriage.

\---------------

So, first off, I want to say that I love my wife and think that she's a wonderful person. She alternates between ESFP and ENFP and I recognize both types in her.¬† I love her energy and enthusiasm in exploring new ideas and experiences with me!¬† She is often remarkably compassionate and selfless with our kids.¬† Her willingness to challenge my beliefs/thinking and to advocate for me and my wellbeing when I struggle to do so for myself are invaluable.

From what I understand of ESFPs, this may not be a very popular post, but I'm hoping you can help me communicate better with my wife. We've got a lot of circumstances working against us. This year has not been kind to us financially, with my worsening health threatening my ability to work (as a workaholic trying to do better), many thousands of dollars of medical bills mounting trying to find a diagnosis/treatment, and $10k+ of fraud and theft from our renovation contractor.

My wife, as gracious as she is, can be really¬† one-sided or even petty when she talks to others about people she is upset with, particularly if she feels that they have crossed her or rejected her in some way.¬† Sooner or later she gets really upset with me and our marriage.

Don't get me wrong, I make lots of mistakes and do/say things that make me hard to live with sometimes. The only real mitigating factor is that I really do try to never be an asshole, am genuinely open to criticism, and work hard to change behavior and even attitudes once I understand the effect of what I'm doing or saying. Change is hard and isn't immediate, especially if I don't understand what the issue is or how to change it at first, but I do change. I'm grateful that she's helped me learn how to be a better person through our conflicts.

So, here's the thing, whenever this happens she tells me that it happened because she was talking with someone else who told her she was being mistreated, and then when she thinks back on some past interactions she gets really angry.¬† I've come to recognize that I suck at picking up on emotional cues, so this always blindsides me.¬† I've tried asking her periodically how she's feeling or if she's happy in our marriage, but even days before the blow-up she responds that she's happy. Additionally, asking seems to annoy her, particularly if there is any frequency.

Another major communication barrier is that when I try to talk with her to find a resolution to a disagreement, she often feels like I'm being manipulative or dismisses my perspective out of hand as being unrealistic or otherwise invalid.¬†

I am typically very open to the possibility that I'm wrong, and am even grateful for being proven wrong so that I can start being ""not-wrong."" I honestly don't feel like I'm trying to be manipulative.¬†

Because I don't understand what I can change in my approach to be effective, I've come to feel like I don't have a voice in our marriage and end up constantly sacrificing my needs and aspirations to help support her being in another play, getting a new pet, etc.¬† Don't get me wrong, I love to see her shine, but eventually my inner, emotional self rebels against my overwhelmed logical exterior and I blow up. I don't yell or call her names, but I get angry and critical of what she's done (or not done) that I feel pushed me over my stress limit. I inherited an instinctive scowl from my dad (that is REALLY hard for me to control) that can, in itself, be abusive.

How do you get through these kinds of hurdles? How do you set boundaries in your marriage that keep anyone from feeling controlled or responsible for making things work that they may think are impossible?

Thanks for sticking with me through this long post!¬† I love her and really want to make this work, but with our current life pressures, we can't go on as we have before.",1592596509

ESFP,"Wanted to post some really great anime ESFPs that I think truly are ESFP in my opinion. You probably already guessed and noticing some ESFP and ENFP confusion online since you guys look so alike from each other and everyone has their own opinions which is fine. But I wanted to do this today and share my personal opinion on anime characters that I see that are definitely ESFPs in my opinion and are great and amazing characters as well and very well written too. You guys complain for good reason that the MBTI community doesn't do you justice and stereotypes you guys too often and get prejudged a lot by stereotypes you guys are known for and I feel you.

So I wanted to do this post as a thanks for being awesome and discussion of what anime characters I think are ESFPs for sure and are great characters as well in the anime community. Now I'm gonna get this out of the way, I'll share my opinion on the big ones that people debate often for anime main characters that get debated ENFP vs ESFP in the community. In my opinion I type Goku, Gon Freecss, Luffy, and Naruto ENFPs, I feel they've shown Ne and Si each plenty of times to argue the case for each one and make the case for why their each individually ENFPs. That's my opinion though, if you agree or disagree feel free to share your opinions down below. I'll posts links to posts I've made on them or other people's post on them that I agree with if you want to see evidence for why I think so for each character. I personally see Ash Ketchum ENFP too but that's my opinion as well. Share your opinions down below again if you feel you want to or feel differently about something, I'll post the links down below. But this post isn't about them, it's about other characters that I see in my opinion as awesome ESFPs and great characters that people already know and love or need to talk about more and give more love and attention to and should recognize as awesome ESFP characters, alright enough with the essay I'll post my opinions down below now:

Naruto, surprisingly I haven't done a Naruto post yet but I know he's ENFP in my opinion and I've been watching the anime again and I see his Ne and Si in the first 7 episodes, I'm gonna make a Naruto post in time once I finish my rewatch and reread so until then I'll just link this post I agree with, tell me what you think on it if you want:

Now for the awesome characters I see as clear ESFPs in my opinion, here's my list of all them written out for you guys:

Awesome ESFP anime characters:

Kuwabara - This man is amazing and one of my favorite anime characters of all time. He's fantastic and relatable and very funny and down to Earth. He has a heart of gold and great morality and has a awesome dynamic between him and Yusuke who's ESTP. Kuwabara is sometimes mistyped ESFJ but no this man is ESFP for sure, he uses Se and Fi all the thime and he's an awesome ESFP anime character at that. Overall great character, gonna make a character analysis on him when the time comes when I get to rewatching Yu Yu Hakusho again.

Knuckle - Another great Kuwabara like character, made by Togashi again. Very manly and tough but has a soft side that the show often gets on him for and its very funny side to his character. Again heart of gold and great morality, he loves animals, he helps Gon out even though Gon got mad at him for it, haha. Knuckle is great what more do I need to say, he's an amazing character and one of Togashi's best.

Brook - One of the best straw hats from One Piece. One of the best characters in One Piece as well. Most people agree on this, he's amazing and extremely creative idea on Oda's part. He's a talking skeleton with an Afro with a extremely sad backstory but still keeps his sense of humor and is very down to earth as well. He loves to perform and make music and make people laugh and make jokes. He's more practical than Luffy which is a nice touch and is realistic and loyal to Luffy and Laboon. He make his own band and music artist career of sorts which is amazing and hilarious at the same time. He was incredible in the New World especially in the Big Mom arc, anyone that seen the arc knows what I'm talking about. It's Brook what more do I need to say, Soul King will live on forever.

Mina Ashido - One of the more newer ones, she's spontaneous and in the moment and loves to dance and party. She likes to break dance and get involved in class activities and likes to get everyone else involved as well in the fun. She's bright and energetic and full of life and has a interesting and unique design to her. Love Mina she's a great character and one of the best characters in class 1-A.

Joey Wheeler - Now where do I begin. This guy is a fantastic character and probably started the heart of gold ESFP stereotype first before among all of them. Joey is an awesome character with great morality and tons of funny humor to him as a character as well, its true he started off a bully to Yugi but once they changed and Yugi helped him he never left his side and stayed loyal to him till the end. Joey is great an amazing character and I always loved when he was on screen and the duels he was apart of in the series.

Ty Lee - from Avatar she's a rather interesting one. She seems one note at first and just attractive and all that initially. But as the series progressed we learn more about her and her backstory and learn to empathize with her more rather than our first initial impression of her in the beginning when they were around the campfire. She might not seem to important of a character among the cast to some people out of all the Avatar cast but I felt her character was done well enough to mention her here so here you go, Ty Lee is among the greats.

Asta - Another newer one from Black Clover. I think Asta is an interesting case for a character so far. I haven't gotten too far in Black Clover so I don't have too much to say about him but from what I've seen I'm starting to like his character more and can see his determination and drive to reach his goals and do whatever it takes to get to where he wants to be to be Wizard King. He's shaping up to be great and more interesting so I wanted to mention him here since I feel he deserved it and it was necessary.

Mario - Super Mario, this is a video game character but I'll mention him here anyway. Where do I even begin, he's the biggest video game character in the world and his jumping and Se has changed the world forever in video game history. He follows his heart with his Fi and he lives to jump and perform for us as Jumpman for years to come in countless Mario games that we love to play no matter how many times we do it. His Se helps him jump and respond to details in the environment perfectly which is why he's the best debatably video game character ever made. It's Mario, he's awesome, we all now this. Let's love him and enjoy his character forever in all time.

Ino - The Naruto series isn't known for developing its characters the best out of the bunch but despite this Naruto is still a great series despite its flaws and I think Ino is still a great character among the cast. She bonded really well with her team, Shikamaru and Chouji. They make a really good team and she has an interesting dynamic and rivalry with Sakura. She had a lot of good in the Chuunin Exam forest and I believe had some great fights later as well from memory. Overall Ino is a great and solid character and I felt she should be mentioned here as well.

I've been friends with an awesome ESFP for years now, and I thought it would be interesting to talk about both the complexities of ESFP-XNXX relationships. I'd love to hear your thoughts!

I've never had a better adventure buddy than my ESFP friend. We've travelled all over the world together, and her spontaneity, enthusiasm, and present-ness are a great complement to my eagerness to explore the new and different. As a J, I help make our plans a bit easier to execute, and as a P she helps me be more flexible, as is often needed!

We both love the arts and history, so we go to the opera and museums and watch documentaries together. I feel this deep connection to the emotional significance of art, and the different perspectives on the world offered up by history stoke my imagination and curiosity. I think she experiences a somewhat different version of delight, though the exact nature of it eludes me...

We have a deep affection for one another, but it's still hard for us to connect at surface level sometimes. I tend to try to connect to others by sharing feelings and innermost thoughts, and she has trouble relating to that. She likes to keep things light. I think it's important for me to take her affection for granted, although she doesn't always show it in ways that I expect. 

Our biggest hurdle is that she prefers to avoid direct confrontation and pushes down her feelings to keep things fun and light. I can't read the nonverbal cues she gives when she's bothered, and I continue bothering her! We've been discussing this lately, and I'd love to hear any suggestions about how to be a friend that better suits her personality.

Keep being beautiful ESFPs, and thanks for reading!",1592492646

ESFP,"so there's this ESFP girl my age (mid 20's) that i work with... long story short, we connected and related pretty well last summer, but she had to back away because she was in a relationship with a super protective guy... and I also came on a bit strong.

For the next like 8 months i respected her space and didn't really converse with her at all with conversations outside of work-related topics.

Anyways, within the past two weeks they broke up... I saw her at work in the break room and asked her how she had been..

She looked sad and her body language seemed very hurt due to the breakup... I then asked her if she wanted to talk sometime, and she said ""oookayyyy...""

I didn't want to force the issue so I deviated to something casaul and asked her what she's eating, then said ""see ya around!"" and left...

Looking back I think i should've asked her if she wanted to get coffee, but didn't want to capitalize on her vulnerability and think I should wait a bit before asking her.

...Yet I also want to ask her to get coffee, maybe she wants someone to be there for her. 

I'm kinda torn, did I do the right thing?",1592456205

ESFP,"Hi, so I'm an ENFP and I've been really good friends with an ESFP girl (I'm a guy) for 2 years now. I've always though she was really beautiful and we get along super well, and I think while I've been denying it to myself, I may have had a crush on her for awhile now. And tbh I'm not sure what to do about it, and a lot would depend on how she felt. She's def my best female friend and I'd be happy keeping it that way if I thought that was for the best, but I've always wondered if I might surprisingly have a chance with her, for quite a lot of reasons. 

So early on when I knew her, she stumbled into my room drunk, wanted us to go hang out on my bed, and said something about whether I wanted to do something unexpected, but at that point she was only a friend to me so I didn't think it was worth finding out what exactly that all meant. Idk if thats just standard ESFP behavior but at the time I felt pretty sure where that all was headed. She's literally told me she tends to go for taller thiner guys, in other words me to a t, so I guess that helps too.

Despite me being more shy than most extraverts she's tried to get me to do things with her, which I love as it gets me out of my comfort zones and makes having fun way easier. If I actually want to just hang out with her, however, I always have had to be the one reaching out, until more recently (before the virus) when she finally started reaching out too. We also go out to parties together quite a lot especially recently, we both love drunk/high dancing so much. One thing thats happened a couple of times is we'll just be dancing and she'll be like ""just pretend to be my bf"" and then she'll kiss me a bunch (only on the cheek I think), always saying that she's warding off interested guys. For most people that would be a sign if it happens a few times, I think, but with her who knows. I mean she does like to use people as human pillows whenever possible so she doesn't exactly shy away from random physical contact. 

She's always been super straightforward with guys, but also really shies away from anything like real feelings, which maybe doesn't help me much?  Anyways, there a few things here that always made me think about what she meant by them, and whether that was just something reflecting her personality, or if it meant more, and I figured you guys might have some ideas as ESFPs. And thanks if u took the time to read this big mess of randomness, its much appreciated!",1592367061

ESFP,"Hello!

I‚Äôm a baby when it comes to Reddit, MBTI, and knowing that I‚Äôm an ESFP, so I would love to hear others‚Äô perspectives here :,)

To put it bluntly, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm capable of love. Not to say I‚Äôm a psychopath, because I can tell you I cry at anything that makes me happy, sad, or angry real easily. But I just don‚Äôt think I understand the concept of love, which has just become this belief that I can‚Äôt love.

In my last (and honestly, only,) true relationship, I flung around ‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù like it was nothing. But when it boiled down to some of our arguments (consisting of my INTP ex boyfriend constantly berating himself and me trying to assure him that I loved him,) I took a step back eventually and really thought about the weight of the phrase.

And I realized that I didn‚Äôt love him. 

Which is crazy because I just said I don‚Äôt know what love is like, but I know I didn‚Äôt love him because I started growing impatient and tired of having to pick him up on a daily basis. (Its really terrible of me to say that, but that is what I felt because even if I had a rough day, I always had to shift my focus away from myself.) On top of that, I realized that I didn‚Äôt feel any spark when I was with him, and (a bit TMI but whatever,) kissing just felt bland. Boring.

Nowadays I have a lot of superficial crushes based off of appearance and occasional levels of attention the other gives me. I usually get over it because I just realize that I don‚Äôt genuinely like/love them like that. Do you think it‚Äôs because I have yet to experience love? I know ESFPs are stereotyped to be people who are frequently bored and prefer not to commit to one thing, so is that coming into play here?

I‚Äôd love to hear any experiences or advice out there :,) I haven‚Äôt really confessed this to my friends, but I felt like the capability to be anonymous here is what‚Äôs helping me out",1592041993

There has been another time too with a different friend who I'm no longer friends with where it was always a struggle getting her to do things with me because she wasn't a down person. Anyway, I was talking to my friend who I don't see that often anymore. I told her that I don't like how most of the time when we hang out, we're always doing the same stuff that we did in the past. This stuff includes either going to each others' house to watch movies and bake, grab a drink around the mall and just walk around, or get lunch/dinner at a restaurant and chat.

My friend said that she's more of an introvert who prefers doing simpler things. I then told her that it's mostly just dependent on whether or not she wants to go out and do different things. She didn't have much to say to this part, so I stopped talking about it for a bit. However I was still thinking about all the friends I have and how none of them are down to do things that are more fun like rave, party, go to clubs, bar hop, travel, go on road trips, and hit up Vegas.

Since I was getting annoyed thinking about this, I decided to ask that same friend if she ever feels like life is just passing her by. She repeated again that she's just really simple, so she prefers staying home or just doing relaxing things if she does go out with friends.

I mentioned that to me it seems like if people aren't going out an experiencing a bunch of fun things, it's like their life is just passing by with nothing meaningful like it's a waste. She said it seemed like I was judging her, but I was simply asking her a question then adding in my own input.

\-F18

\-I enjoy arguing but only with authority figures. not really with friends, and wouldn't consider myself a 'debater' or 'devil's advocate'. i kinda just enjoy starting shit for the fun of it

\-In high school i loved theatre, and loved performing, but right now i'm studying honours sciences in university. However i don't put much effort into me school work and kind of just do whatever (\*cough cough\* smoke weed) instead

\-Generally pretty lazy, but when i actually want to do something i do it straight away without hesitation or any type of planning

\-I'm very outspoken about how i feel, but only when the feeling doesn't put me in a vulnerable position. For example i will be open about anger and disappointment, however when it comes to actual love, trauma and mental health struggles, it's very hard for me to open up

\-I enjoy being the life of the party, and am definitely extraverted. just in general i love meeting new people. even if most of the time i don't like them, it's still fun to interact with them and see how things can play out

\-I'm kind of a slut. because i crave physical validation from others :/

\-I'm pretty good at getting an idea of what a person is like as soon as i meet them, and can easily tell who i will like and who i won't

\-I am also diagnosed with ADHD. not sure if relevant, but it definitely affects the way i go about doing things, such as it makes me less organized and terrible with time management (hence why i'm a P and not a J)

One of ways I‚Äôve learned to manage my time better is by incorporating The Parkinson‚Äôs Law into my life. It essentially states that ‚Äú**Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.**‚Äù

Simply put, this means that our work often tends to increase in complexity and get drawn out with more and more time. And so, self-imposed time constraints could possibly change the way you approach your work and thus, help you optimize your output.

I tried this out for myself here - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcmluD1MfzQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcmluD1MfzQ).

So my ESFP is a small business owner but he‚Äôs always looking for ‚Äúopportunities‚Äù.

He invested $50k for example into a friend‚Äôs gym. The gym is struggling and he cycles between ‚Äúman I wasted $50k‚Äù and ‚ÄúI shouldve invested more!‚Äù The gym shows no sign of making a profit for years.

He got a call today, from an old friend, they were telling him about their new business and looking for help in selling the product and he offers to invest $25k. As he is telling me about this company, I ask him what they do and he basically just got excited because his friend said big names like CNN and ESPN, he doesnt know what the company does. 

He keeps doing things like this.

I gently told him my opinion about investing in the gym, said it was probably best not to, he agreed then did it anyway.

I told him not to do this new opportunity, super gentle, I said ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs best to re-invest in yourself and your business.‚Äù His response was ‚ÄúI have already invested so much in myself, I cant miss a great opportunity‚Äù

This makes me sad because I feel like he is being easily manipulated.

It's a good situation and I stand to become a homeowner if I really bust my ass.  The logistics aren't my concern.  It's how I'll feel emotionally.

This is essentially rehab for me while I rehab a house.  Something in my formative years lead me to believe I can't trust myself and as a result I have very little self esteem and shame surrounding what seems like a long history of social failures.  My last wave of depression feels like it washed all empathy away.  Or worse, ive become bitter and generally hateful of my fellow man.  I really can't tell which way is up or down with it and with positivity on such short supply im just going to burn the house down (figuratively) and start with what I know now.

ESFP,"I am sharing this here because I am really interested on the type of response that I may get and also unloading my conscience. This at the expense of exposure, which hurts but the lesson is more valuable than pain so here it goes:

 I am in a tight spot in my life right now. I don¬¥t know if I can pay next month¬¥s rent. I left my country in an attempt to put my life back in order. I am struggling to finally put my health on check.  
 Today I got a little breather from the stress and suddenly a lot of emotional baggage I have been neglecting came rushing back. The last 4 hours I have been emotionally introspecting and talking to myself seriously, like a father voices his concerns to a son.

 I have been introspecting about my past relations with my friends and how selfish I was. Selfish to the point I could not see how these friends of mine related to other people. I just cared about me and them. everyone else was in the way.

 I got to the point why I was being selfish. I was using them to satisfy my social needs in return they would satisfy theirs. Being solely focused on hour hobbies, that was all we could satisfy. But I was always waiting for the relationship to become something more than that. I think that I would rather become more attached to someone rather than to find someone else. 

 In attempts to make stronger bonds I quickly realized resistance from their part. After trying multiple times I soon got over it. But still I was not finding reliable substitutes for these people, so I stayed by their side. I never was socially savvy, my best bet was to wait for them to change. Obviously that never happened. Meanwhile we were enabling each other to live or teenage lives with each other. Our meetings were that time when we could get out our awkward personality without being judged.

 Years passed, we were still meeting ritualistically. I always stayed near my parents house but most of my friends went abroad to study or work. I feel that ,for them, our meetings were just a nice throwback to spice life a little bit. But for me it was different. I still regarded this people as my best friends, despite only seeing them a couple weeks per year. I got stuck on getting closer to them, while they clearly got away from me.

After some testing to see if they would notice absence, my emotional inner child was convinced this people did not mean much to me anymore. I was alone for years without realizing. With no friends and a bad relationship with my stepdad I decided to leave my country and commit social suicide. I have met a lot of people besides my friends but I never regarded them as my friends because I had my ""real friends"" coming next summer. After all, I had no significant relations with anybody because my heart was filled with this hollow memories of the past. Holding on the the idea of friends because I was afraid of looking for new pals.

Here I am, all alone, writing this, poking a social network to see if it jerks. I hope this has made you think about the space you have in your heart. It is not limited and you have to organize and clean it up before you put something new in it. I have my conclusion of all of this, but I think it would egotistical to not let you think about your own conclusion as well.

Find some peace of mind and clean your heart,

But I, let's just say on the introverted side, happen to really, really like this person, and a relationship is very possible as I have very good reason to assume they like me as well (for the purposes of this, assume that we will get into a relationship please).

That being said, are there any tips or advice that would be good for me to know? I really want this relationship to work (I'd be using curse words to back this up were I not wanting to keep this a little calmer and collected) and I think I've been doing somewhat well and I also think I have a good idea of what to do. However, due to circumstances as well as my private nature, this is my first relationship, which is not the same for theirs, so the pressure is really on, and I'm scared my inexperience is going to ruin it! So again, I'm really nervous, so any and all advice would be incredibly appreciated!

To anyone who does help or provide any advice, I'd love to thank you in advance!

* Looks very cold and unapproachable at first impression. She doesn't speak much and hardly initiates meeting a person first. However once you get to know her a little longer, she'll slowly begin to show her real side. She's actually a really playful, silly girl who laughs at almost everything and enjoys joking around with people. 
* She's a bit reserved and struggles with acting cute or cheesy. 
* Although it's very against the culture where she lives to the point of it being a taboo, she got many piercings and tattoos at the age of 15. She has her entire back tattooed with something she designed on her own. 
* She enjoys drawing and is very good at it. She also loves singing, writing her own songs, playing the guitar, acting, and dancing. She initially majored in art while in college before switching to some sort of communications major. 
* Her dream is to become a famous singer and she said she'll never stop chasing after her dreams and what she wants in life. 
* Extremely hard-working and focused on her goals. Her discipline is really good and she works hard to the point of tiring out her own body and getting stressed. Even then, she still tries to stop at nothing until she achieves her goals. 
* Although she looks like someone who's afraid of nothing and tough, she's not as fearless and strong as people perceive her. She admitted that she's scared that she hasn't worked hard enough, that there are things she hasn't completed perfectly, and that she has disappointed everyone who likes her by not meeting their expectations. 
* She used to barely have any friends at all because she was afraid of getting hurt and she's on the shyer side. Although she barely had friends, she always wished that she could have a lot of friends. On her birthday every year, she would feel sad, lonely, and anxious because she wouldn't have anyone who would celebrate it with her. 
* Even though she wants to have a lot of friends since she's never had many and has always been a lone-wolf type of girl, she's definitely an introvert who enjoys staying at home.
* She's pretty good at putting up a front when she's about to cry. However there are times where it's quite easy to see she's almost going to cry. Sometimes her mood flips within seconds, such as this one time where she was laughing then heard a comment. Immediately her mood flipped and you could see her lip trembling and her eyes starting to water. However the person expanded on their comment and said it was a joke then she immediately started smiling widely again. 
* She likes putting a twist on things and making them different. For example, she enjoys singing but when doing a cover of a song, she likes putting her own spin on it to make the cover a little different. 
* She claims that she's fast-paced and impatient. I don't really see it, but I suppose she could be on the impatient side. 
* She wants to bring everyone positivity and happiness. She tries to ignore anyone who dislikes her because she wants to stay happy and hopes everyone else is happy too.
* Pressure helps motivate her 
* She can enjoy compliments just like everyone else can, but what she cares most about is criticism. Once someone criticizes her, she puts all her focus on that and tries her best to improve. She can be pretty hard on herself.
* She says she's a straightforward person; however, she's more gentle depending on who the person is. For example, she's less straightforward with some of her softer friends because she's afraid she could possibly hurt their feelings, which she doesn't want to do.
* She knows how to cut hair and has spent a lot of time cutting other friends' hair too. She enjoys doing her nails and makeup. She has dyed her hair a shade of pink before and currently has burgundy hair.
* Very non-judgmental; she can be friends with anybody and doesn't care about what they do or what they like. 
* She once said something about not being the same person you originally were after going through a rainstorm, and that she hopes people can know her as someone with more possibilities.",1589756814

Another coworker is a jewish guy estj.

ESFP,"I'm a university student and I just finished my first year... it was super rough. And there's at least 7 more years of this to come. 

I recently just figured out I was an ESFP and didn't even realize all these cool things about my personality that never shawn because I've been depressed and anxious for the last 11 years. 

In high school, I had trouble concentrating and focusing on the task at hand, I'd get bored, it would take me forever to complete the task, I would procrastinate to the max, make careless mistakes, would get easily distracted, had trouble committing to things due to short attention span... these were indicative of inattentive ADHD according to my psychiatrist, so I tried an ADHD med. It make me dumber, crazy, and extremely emotional. So I stopped that one and tried another one. The other one did nothing. Tried another one. It made me anxious and gave me heart palpitations. Tried another one. Did nothing, and now I was out of options.

Conclusion: 4 ADHD medications tried, nothing worked; I didn't have ADHD and no one knew what my problem was. 

I thought maybe it was depression and anxiety that made me like this, and maybe that's true, but recently I've been feeling a lot better and have had a much more optimistic view of life (this is not to say I'm cured , it doesn't work that way, but I may be on a good path) and I don't spend most of my days in bed anymore! 

So I found out I was an ESFP not too long ago (it's so spot on it's kinda creepy), and two of the flaws suggest that we are unfocused and easily bored. That is literally one of my biggest problems - I always end up doing what I want to do in any given moment (and it's usually wayyy more fun than what I should be doing) Or if I do sit down and study, I get distracted with small details like making my notes look perfect and aesthetically pleasing, so I often rewrite things and that takes a considerable amount of time out of my study time. And then I get bored, so I tell myself its time to take a break. Then I get buried into the other thing I'm doing during my break. My time management skills are shit, but I was able to coast through high school cause it wasn't too difficult for me but university was a shit show! And I'm aiming for professional programs so the next several years are going into schooling, but I have to do really well in school if I wanna graduate and have a career :')

So I'm asking, how have you guys managed to make yourselves stay focused? I think that might be the biggest thing I need to work on, cause if I remain focused I'll get it done quicker. 

Sorry for the big wall of text! TL;DR: I have trouble staying focused, following through with a plan for the day because I just end up doing whatever I want, and it takes me forever to do something probably because I try really hard to make it look nice rather than actually getting it done (this is most applicable to taking notes - I spend more time making it look pretty rather than learning the material). These have affected my school performance because I have no time management skills and some of the ESFP flaws are uncontrolled on my part. There's several more years of schooling for me and I need to find a way to fix these and would love some tips from you guys!",1589231782

ESFP,"# Am I an ENFP or ESFP?

I get ESFP on the MBTI and didn't question it until my psych professor said that she thinks I'm a total ENFP. Now I'm on the fence.

&amp;#x200B;

Pros for ESFP:

\- I have an eye for aesthetics and dressing well has always come easy to me

\- when I'm around other people or actively doing something, I'm in the moment and focused on the present

\- I'm into skincare, cooking, health, makeup, celebrities, style, food, photography and design

\- I value art for its' aesthetics, visual impact, and feelings it invokes instead of its' abstract or symbolic meaning

\- I care a lot about my appearence and enjoy keeping up on tanning, nail, and hair appointments

\- I enjoy working out, dancing at the bars with my friends, and used to play sports competitively in high school

\- I struggle with abstract concepts in college and absolutely hated English class growing up because all of the fcking symbolism in books

\- i find political and philosophical debates absolutely exhausting and will actually leave the room as soon as people start getting overly theoretical

\- I prefer everyday to intellectual conversations

\- Most of my friends are sensors and I've been happily dating an ESTP for 2 years

&amp;#x200B;

Pros for ENFP:

\- When I'm alone, I daydream about my future (what will my wedding be like? how will I be as a parent? when will I start my business? what if I moved to costa rica to start over? which way can I give back to people around the world when I'm older and have money?)

\- I'll sometimes get completely lost in thought when I'm by myself or bored

\- I like to write

\- I often pick up on things during conversations that a lot of other people don't notice, such as conversational subtext, hidden emotions, and peoples' vibes

\- I'm outgoing but I prefer to let my friends steal the show while I hype them up

\- I have a horrible memory for mundane details, instructions, and tasks but I can remember how I felt on a random day when I was 8 years old

\- When someone I care about is struggling, my first instinct is to encourage them and try to help them see their own potential

\- I have a witty and sometimes offbeat sense of humor

\- I appreciate sarcasm + a good metaphor 

\- I overthink things when I'm stressed",1589171311

What are traits of a truly, healthy ESFP?

What would most likely inspire them towards hero work?

ESFP,"This is actually pissing me off. If I'm hanging out with a group of friends and I feel even the slightest left out for 2 seconds, I just become super quiet and depressed. I feel like they don't want me there.

Random jokes that are the very least insulting hurt me for months. I think about them nonstop. Occasionally I isolate myself, and not contact anyone because I feel like a liability. 

But when I'm talking to one person, I talk a lot. I become my usual self, until their facial expressions change and they look ""annoyed"". I immediately shut up. This is also in group chats, I can have a lot of things to say but I'm scared of people judging me for typing too much. 

But when I'm getting attention from everyone, I'm completely myself. I don't even worry about being judged, I just feel happy in that moment. I hate that I unintentionally get sad when I don't get attention and I stop talking.

ESFP,"I've typed myself as an ESTP before but I think I just have strong Te. I'm going on a bit of a ramble here but I'm curious if any others relate or sees strong tertiary Te in me. 

* It's important for me to be strong willed. As a child I was very innocent and bubbly but by the time my mid teens came I learned how to be more strong willed and commanding. Finding this new side of me was relieving because I could stand up for what I believed in with direction and will while also protecting my sensitive side. 
* I enjoy directing people. I found myself starting being capable of being firm and direct with people I'm in a group with in order for us to accomplish a goal. I'm still cheerful and upbeat but I can be fully capable of directing, giving instructions, etc.  A bit bossy at times.
* I don't care if something works but if something is easy to use, and has a purpose for its use. I like to hear other people's opinions, gather the facts and make a conclusion from it. I dislike to debate unless I have the facts with me in order for me to use it to backup my point, without data points to reference, I feel aimless when talking about my opinions. 
* My feeling side comes to my play when there are people and a moral crisis involved. Obviously, I'm still an Fi user. I see the world through my inner emotions. I hold the people that I've internally let in very close to me. But on the outside even if I act bubbly and cheerful, I can also act very professional and business like. I'm good with self discipline, I may be spontaneous but I'm good at appearing detached and objective even when deep down my inner side represent a whole new world. 
* I'm a huge procrastinator and prefer to spontaneously improvise and figure out my shit from there, but when I do feel passionate for something then I like to use established methods to help my goals. I look up tutorials, figure out what advice people who are experienced tell me and then find a way that others have done the same thing successfully and essentially repeat their process. I think this has made me good in the things I've found passion in.
* I struggle dealing with my softer side. I'm definitely an Fi user. I feel deeply over many things, some things just feel really 'wrong'. I love to sing and dance and express myself through any form of sensory experience but I also am afraid of this side's vulnerability. Using Te helps me feel protected of myself and others while also bringing forth the change I want to see.",1589053836

I‚Äôve been experimenting with ways to reach a state of flow, in order to improve my focus and increase my output.

Little did I know that this has a lot to do with the challenge that a task presents, as well as my ability to undertake that task. I‚Äôve realized that the sweet spot where you tend to reach your flow is when your skills are fully involved in overcoming a suitable challenge.

If you‚Äôre wondering how you can attempt to enter a state of flow with whatever you‚Äôre working on, this is what has helped me.

1. Eliminate Distractions (Both Internally and Externally)
2. Avoid Multitasking
3. Use a Time-based Productivity Technique
4. Have a Clear Outcome or Goal in Mind

ESFP,"Hi everyone! I'm Derek (ENTJ). My friends and I just recently launched an MBTI based dating app called Boo, but have gotten thousands of sign ups already. After much tweaking, we finally wanted to share this with you in the hopes that this may help you find like-minded friends and loved ones.

We felt like current dating apps were really inefficient. They help you meet more people, not more of the right people. This means wasted time, money, and emotional preparation on bad dates with no chemistry. It's not just bad dates; the time and effort from swiping, messaging, arranging dates, and preparing both emotionally and physically, just for dates to continuously not work out, has led to dating fatigue and the sense that online dating is hopeless. It's also hard to tell what a person is actually like through text, only to be disappointed after meeting or the first month of dating.

What we as MBTI enthusiasts have always known is that who we are (personality type) tends to influence the kinds of people we're attracted to, and it doesn't make sense for this not to play a part in mainstream online dating.

We wanted to create a radically authentic, transparent, and empathetic dating experience where people can feel free to be themselves, because it is exactly by being yourself that the right person will come along and like and appreciate you for who you naturally are. On Boo, if someone matched with you, they‚Äôre already aware of your best and worst traits, and still decided they‚Äôd rather have you over any other type. On Boo, you‚Äôre already what each other are looking for.

As an ESFP, you're the life of the party; there's never a dull moment with you. You also have great aesthetic tastes and people skills. But at your worst, you're not a great long term planner, tend to engage in risky behavior, and overengage in self-indulgement. You‚Äôll want someone who sees the world as you do and loves you for your best, but also understands and forgives you at your worst, and would have it no other way. 

Our app is completely free, and you can download on

ESFP,"Hi! I'm an ENTP and I'd really like to get to know the other types better, especially ESFPs. Lately though, I've been having a bit of trouble. 

Bit of background: I used to have severe depression/anxiety/PTSD issues, so my parents sent me to a residential program. Turns out, if you group a bunch of people with a wide variety of issues together, the environment gets pretty toxic. Who knew? Long story short, the two ESFPs there would antagonize me and some of my friends. One would make subtle(ish) underhanded remarks about being creeped out by my bisexuality and steal my belongings, then claim that I was lying. AND I shared a room with her, where she would walk around naked, but would make remarks whenever I tried to change my shirt (""Can you put those away? We're all straight here, so you can stop""). This situation is incredibly unfortunate, because those were the only confirmed ESFPs I've known in my life, which leads me to the possibility that maybe it wasn't them, it was me.

I've always worked hard to see things from multiple points of view and be a good listener and friend. If I've ever had an issue with anyone, I've always been able to talk it through with them. But for some reason, whatever I did just didn't work with them. So I'm wondering if there's some form of communication that I'm lacking. I feel really guilty about it, and super worried that it might happen with someone else. It's been half a year since it happened, but I still can't get it out of my head.

Of course, I might just be overthinking. They might just be plain old mean, or homophobic, or just going through a rough time. But either way, I don't want to make anyone feel angry or disgusted. Also, you all seem so fun, and I really admire your vitality and your wit. I'd also like to get to know you all!

I'm just curious if any other women feel this way. I got out of a long term relationship recently and I'm realizing I don't think I ever want to be married. I'm not interested in being in a long term relationship either. Not because the relationship was dysfunctional or anything, it was normal, fairly healthy, no abuse and he treated me with respect etc. I'm finding I miss the movie watching, talking, physical things but not the actual relationship status.

I guess when I think about it, it just makes me sad to think anyone is voluntarily spending any time on this planet being unhappy voluntarily, and it seems like there are SO many unhappy married people who stay because they made a commitment. I know there are happy ones too! But it seems like there are far less.

And I think you should try honor that commitment, but  I guess to me, why make it in the first place if there's a chance you just won't love each other anymore at some point and you know you made a promise to stay and be unhappy? 

I think so many people are not prepared to love the different versions (depressed, anxious, sad, happy) of a person for hopefully, 50-60 years. I honestly doubt my ability to sustain a relationship for that long. :/

One of my best friends is an ESFP and she is amazing! You're guaranteed to have fun when she's around and she's also very insightful. 

The app has only just become available in the app stores (iOS and Android), but we've had thousands of sign ups already.

Firstly, we wanted to let you know about it because we thought it might be of interest. We've had lots of people get in touch to say they are having some amazing conversations and they've never connected with such great people on a dating app. Most people aren't meeting up in person at the moment due to coronavirus, and of course, safety comes first, but the app usage has gone through the roof as people get to know each other better online and make meaningful connections.

Secondly, we are refining the UI/UX at the moment and we'd really appreciate any feedback (either on here or at [hello@sosyncd.com](mailto:hello@sosyncd.com)).

It's totally free to sign up and it only takes a couple of minutes to do so, if you know your personality type already, which you guys obviously do! You also have the option of searching for specific personality types. You just need to search for So Syncd in the App Store or Play Store or follow the link to the website below.

We hope you are safe and well during this challenging time. Jess and Lou x

ESFP,"From what I read this article gives the best breakdown for Esfp. Esfp may choose careers that engage their sensual nature through food, textiles, art, or music. ESFPs often want a career that allows them to move around, and generally prefer a work environment that is aesthetically pleasing.

ESFPs are stressed by strict rules or excessive bureaucracy at work, and want the flexibility to address situations as they arise. They generally focus on the demands of the present moment, and do not usually like to work on long-term projects, preferring work that has immediate and tangible results.

ESFP,"I was introduced to porn in the first grade, shamed a few years later when my parents caught me (called a disgusting pervert), and have had a ‚Äúplayer‚Äù mentality since the fourth grade. 

Here I am, 21 years old, afraid of vulnerability and sex is almost at the very top of my priorities / value system. I don‚Äôt have many regrets in life, but the ones I do have, are all about missing out on a sex related opportunity, regardless of the choices I made which were aligned with my morals. For example, one of my old best friends‚Äô girlfriend tried to make a move on me, and I rejected it and reminded her of her boyfriend. However, I replay that memory at least every other day, and fantasize about what would‚Äôve happened had I just went along with it. It happened about five years ago. 

These girls have a tendency to fall in love with me, and agree to have sex (I don‚Äôt push, I suspect they think it‚Äôs a way into my heart), but I always end up having sex a few times and then losing interest. Relationships, therefore, are extremely difficult for me. I must have physical attraction as well as a personality attraction. 

So my question is: does this qualify as a sex addiction? Is there something wrong with me, or is this a common trait amongst other ESFPs? Also, if it is common, how the fuck do I fix it?",1588041142

She's manipulative and thinks she's an innocent person with great intentions when she's one of the meanest and most self centered people I've ever met and is not rational at all.

ESFP,"Hello! :)

Lately I have asked myself, if there are connections/relationships between the Myer-Briggs-Types we like the most and our own type. So I wanted to make a survey to find out the ""favorite"" types of each Myer-Briggs-Type.

If you have, can you please tell **up to three** personality types (**excluding your own**) you like interacting with most and with which you prefer to spend your time with. Just the one you like the most.

**For example**:  
I am Enfp and I like XXXX, XXXX and XXXX the most 

\----&gt; you don¬¥t need to explain *why* you like them the most

Since the mbti community has 88k Members and the Enfp community alone has 42k members, I decided that I would post this post on each subreddit of each type because I want as much answers as possible. So sorry in advance if you might see this post more than once

And yes, I know that even within one personality type, the people differ, we are all individuals. But from my experience with people with different personality types I can say that, in general I liked a specific personality type more than an other.

I will be happy about receiving every comment anwering my question!! :))",1584996036
ESFP,"* My main concern in life is being girly and chic. I hate anything perceived as masculine, such as playing sports, watching competitive things, playing video games, wearing dark colors, listening to rap music, and other things. I like watching fashion vlogs, makeup tutorials, singing, dancing, shopping, taking selfies, and other things along those lines. My career goal is to become a visual merchandiser for a high-end designer brand like Chanel. 
* In school, I'm pretty lazy and don't care about my grades as long as I pass. I just want to do the bare minimum. I find cheating on exams fun, usually copy other people's work, have gotten truancy letters, and have failed a couple classes. Group members have had a problem with me for free-riding, but I always just dismiss them with a sassy reply. I'm uninterested in getting to know my classmates because as shallow as it sounds, I don't care to befriend anyone unless I find them girly and pretty because I want friends I share common interests with. 
* I come across bitchy and cold, partially because I barely speak or smile. I don't care about the haters at all and I'm known to have an attitude. I've sassed many customers at work and I'm quite blunt, so it's not rare for people to have an issue with me. In the first place, I barely work anyway because I just want free time to do things I enjoy.
* My biggest fear is becoming fat and manly because those are things I really can't stand on other people. I have to be as girly and skinny as possible. I'm not interested in dating, but if I were to date, I'd want a guy to spoil me with gifts, treat me like I'm a queen, and do things my way. I have expensive taste and like the finer things in life. I think expensive designer items like Chanel, YSL, Celine, Prada, Louis Vuitton and more are so gorgeous and I aspire to collect many of these items to make people jealous. Also even though I don't drink, I think going to expensive, fancy restaurants with champagne and expensive red wine is classy and chic. One of my friend's mom has many designer items, loves fine dining, and lives an extravagant life. I wish she was my mom instead. I love the Kylie Jenner lifestyle, minus her body because she's plastic. I hate surgery. My ideal place to travel is anywhere people view as classy, chic, and girly like Paris.
* My idol is Ariana Grande because she's so girly and successful, yet she's still a feminist who knows her worth and will put people in their place for disrespecting her. Even though I barely speak, I also really like attention and praise. If I'm feeling more extroverted, I sometimes will talk a lot but if the conversation isn't in my interest, I don't want to speak at all.
* I hate having my picture taken because I have to know how I look at all times. I can't risk having a bad photo where I end up looking fat or manly or whatever because I have to look perfectly girly and pretty at all times. Some people accuse my voice of being fake because it's really high, but I'm not faking my voice.",1584941939

Apologies for anyone who dislikes this sort of thing, just go ahead and move past this post. (Also disclaimer I am aware that everyone is different, these won‚Äôt apply to every single person of a type and blah blah blah you get it)

Let me start with, you all are one of my favorite types. The outgoing nature that you all possess seriously helps this socially awkward fleshbody typing this out. You all do the talking, you are engaging, and I get to listen and feel more comfortable.  

You all are so much fun and generally just good people. No matter what the situation is, you all seem able to adapt and always appear comfortable in your environment. The human embodiment of go with the flow and live life to the fullest. You all are so vibrant in character can make anyone comfortable, which I will elaborate on later. Bottom line: you all are so friggin awesome I love it.

The welcoming part is where I want to elaborate. You aren‚Äôt welcoming in a ‚Äútraditional sense‚Äù I guess. It is more of an acceptance maybe? Anyone can feel comfortable around you without changing a thing. It is the coolest thing. You all never seem to shut anyone out because they aren‚Äôt like you, you can pretty much mesh with everyone.  

You all are also deeper than a lot of people realize. You all aren‚Äôt all this ‚Äúparty animal, never read a word‚Äù idiot. You have a deeper side. It seems like you all have this sort of natural understanding of people where you know how to lighten up the darkest times. It‚Äôs like you guys can read the individual and know just how to draw them out of their shell. Thank you guys for being so incredible.

When I first took this personality  assessment, I was INTJ. I‚Äôve been lurking the forums and saw that they found a connection with childhood trauma and INTJ, especially with nParents or narcissistic parents you grew up with.

My dad is an ENFJ.
Together they made an ESFP.

- Assertive
- Straightforward nature 
- Practical
- Difficulty expressing emotion

Traits I got from my ENFJ dad:
- Outgoing
- Creative
- Charisma/diplomacy
- Enthusiasm

Conflicting feelings I experience due to the mix:
- At work, I need to know where I stand (ESTJ). I ask often for constructive feedback. However, it takes a lot of energy not to take it personally (ENFJ). 
- I focus heavily on people (ENFJ), I can read their emotions like a maestro, but since I don‚Äôt let their pain burden me (ESTJ) I struggle with empathy. In a nutshell, I can read them but I can‚Äôt help them without getting angry.
- I can be demanding and critical (ESTJ), but since I cherish harmony (ENFJ) I tend to sugar coat my feedback to a fault. If I‚Äôm stressed or in a hurry, this is not the case - which can hurt people‚Äôs feelings.

ESFP,"ISFP (F) here, and I‚Äôve just been confused about this guy I‚Äôve been talking to for a few months now. When we first met he seemed so all in and interested, we texted and talked constantly. Then one day a couple weeks later, he just made a complete 180 overnight.

Within 12 hours his texts suddenly became short, indifferent, and dismissive, and he was the same in person too. I honestly don‚Äôt know what happened, and we never got around to talking about it due to circumstance and him avoiding me. We were still pretty new to each other so I kinda just let this happen and figured we weren‚Äôt right for each other, but then by chance we met somewhere at an event and he ended up kissing me out of the blue (there was some alcoholic influence).

After this though, we talked, and he said he didn‚Äôt know what he wants but that he still wants to be friends. At this point I still wasn‚Äôt that emotionally invested so I said that was fine. I had already figured we wouldn‚Äôt work out so I was t really let down.

Over the next few weeks though, he paid a lot of attention to me and showered me with a lot of care and I‚Äôll admit that what was just a little crush before turned into me actually liking him. I put it aside because I knew he didn‚Äôt feel the same though.

At some point he again suddenly stopped talking to me and growing distant again. I felt that for myself the healthiest thing to do this time was to let it happen and not question it, because I didn‚Äôt want to be at the mercy of my feelings for him anymore, and he‚Äôs clearly truly unsure of what he wants.

This was going fine, but he again did a complete 180 one day and had come back to showing me a lot of attention and concern. I‚Äôm just really confused and tired at this point. I‚Äôve heard ESFP‚Äôs can have a lot of thought buildup sometimes which causes this seemingly sudden but not so sudden decisions.. But is it really normal for an ESFP to have such wild changes of heart SO suddenly?

For me all of these choices he makes are pretty major and not something I could flip my personality around within a 12 hour period about.

ESFP,"Hello,

I (ENTP) am coming here because... I really dont know how to talk to my dad who I think is an ESFP.

I really have trouble communicating with him. 

I am used to people just saying out loud whatever they think but that is not his way. He is always silent and its incredibly difficult to know what he has in head. His emotions are always written on his face though. 

He seems to be keen on meeting me almost everyday to talk on phone or drink a coffee and then looks half asleep in the midst of the ""discussion"" (though I know he is awake because he knows exactly what I say).  

I am more of the type that will spend months not talking to you, then spend 3 days with you non stop which puzzles him to no end as he would always be tired/cold after 2hours and go home asap.

I havent spent much of my childhood with him so I am guessing that these meetups are for the sake of getting closer but... how am I supposed to get closer to him if he barely talks about his thoughts &amp; feelings?",1583008402
ESFP,"I know I can just ask him, but I kind of want to guess because I feel like it helps me learn more about the Myers Briggs and the various functions. I have a new friend who feels like either an ENFP or ESFP. I myself am an ENFP and at first I thought he was an ENFP too because we'll sometimes say the same thing at the same time and that often happens with other ENFPs. But recently we've been hanging out more and I've noticed that physical things seem to come naturally to him (like we went bowling and he just had this very natural form and we met climbing). It didn't initially occur to me that he would be an ESFP because the ones that I know are noticeably better at sports/physical things, but maybe that's just not his thing? He's doing a master's in flute performance, which would be hard to imagine my N self doing. Also, last night we were talking about how we visualize counting sheep and I said I just saw some generic white fence in the middle of nowhere and generic cartoon sheep jumping over it in a rainbow arc. But he said that he saw the details of that fence and the dirt under the fence where it's a little messed up because of when you open the gate and he saw real sheep, not cartoon sheep (he grew up near a lot of farms). It was cute.

\-Don't post anything negative, they already had enough negativity through all this.

\-Don't post like ""XXXX showing my suport for ESTJs"", that's just drawing attention to your own type. We're here to support them, not to promote ourselves.  
\-Even if you don't think you have anything to dedicate to them, just go there and upvote some of their posts, karma is something that we can all give and it's free.

ESFP,"I am an INFJ and I was dating an ESFP for three months. Ninety percent of our relationship was fun, positive and enjoyable although we had some differences in our communication styles -- for example when we'd text, I could text him a huge paragraph conveying all my feelings, details about my day, etc., and he might respond with ""cool!"" A couple weeks ago, we had an argument over text about this communication difference (it took him several hours to respond to something important and it was really brief). After a brief heated exchange he immediately said via text ""maybe we are just better off as friends."" I was shocked that he would throw in the towel so quickly after one sign of conflict, when literally the day before we'd been cuddling on his couch talking about how much we liked each other. The next day I asked to meet up in person and after five minutes of talking we ""got back together."" I was again shocked at how quickly he could go from ""let's be friends"" to ""let's date again."" For me, I would never end something until I've given it a lot of careful thought. 

Fast forward two weeks and we were doing great, at least from my perspective. Hanging out every day he asked me to be his valentine, meet his family, book a trip together. He'd say things like ""I really really like you."" He purchased a bed for my dog at his house. He purchased puzzles on Amazon for us to work on while we watched TV together. Then, he had a  meeting with his therapist and they talked about our relationship in depth. Apparently the therapist told him that our communication differences would never work. My boyfriend called me after the meeting and told me that he had to cancel our plans that evening (about 20 minutes before I was supposed to meet him, no explanation except he'd ""had a day""). I tried to reach out that night to find out if he was OK and he responded hours later with just ""I'm OK thanks."" The next day, I hear nothing. I finally reach out and ask if everything is OK between us and he finally tells me that he's questioning the relationship. We go back and forth, and he seems to be really undecided about it still saying several times ""I'm a mess and all over the place."" When I try to talk some more he says ""please please stop I can't talk about this right now."" I give him space and assume we can talk more when he's feeling better. Instead, he texts the next day and says ""I think we should break up for right now."" 

Here are my questions: Literally the day before all this happened, he did a lot of things like asking me to be his valentine, talking about going on trips together, etc. that indicated to me he was investing in me. Then, he does a 180 literally in one day. Is this an ESFP thing? Going back and forth? Also, he seems to really avoid the difficult conversations. He'd rather say ""My brain is all over the place"" or end things than to have a difficult conversation about an issue we're having. It's like he'd rather run away from the problem than face it head on. Is this also an ESFP thing? Just would like to understand this type better to get a better sense of what was going through his brain.",1582042211

ESFP,"I'm an ISFJ, He's an ESFP

We'd been dating for 2 weeks and since day 1 he's been asking me to go to his house and have some ""fun"". As an ISFJ, I want to first fully trust in an relationship before sex because sex just makes me more emotionally attached to the person and I don't want to risk doing that early in a relationship.

He tried to confront me about this and said a man needs to have his sexual desires met so they know that their feelings are valued and asked me for the reason of not going to his house. I said I want my boyfriend to make me feel loved, I want to see him putting an effort for me. He asked for examples and I said I want my boyfriend to take me on dates, buy me things and in general spoil me (I had a very hard time articulating these but I thought it'd actually help him understand things clearly and our relationship will actually be strengthened)

We'd been dating for 2 weeks and he had only taken me on 2 dates. Apart from those I'd just meet him in his car and he'd do a lot of touch/kiss with me which I absolutely enjoyed them cause I loved him. 

After I told him those he was like ok no problem but became distant and dropped me off near my house without a kiss (I even asked if something was wrong and he said no)

Note that we come from a country where gender roles pretty much still apply in here. 

30 minutes later he sent me this text message: ""we are not compatible with each other, I wish you had told me all that earlier so I wouldn't continue with you. You should look for a sugar daddy instead""

As an ISFJ I just want to be appreciated and my top love language according to the 5 love languages theory is gift giving (being spoiled in general)

I don't date to use people and actually on behalf of ISFJs I can say that a little effort will satisfy us a lot. I just see these efforts as a sign that my bf loves me and it helps me with my trust issues. 

I've been crying these past few dates. He actually ended things in a way that it's all my fault and I actually fell for it. No matter how hard I try not to blame myself but ISFJs are very past oriented I keep saying that if I hadn't said it that way, if I hadn't brought it up, if I had just waited for him to realize that himself, he'd still be here.

ESFP,"Hi.. INFP here.
I've joined the subs of various types to get over my pre-concieved biases and judgements... offcourse it's a lot harder than it sounds... especially since I'm doing this only online.

My preconceived judgements are going to be... pretty much offensive. I'm very sure they are ment to be that way by design considering they mostly come from anxieties. So if you are offended and feel like getting aggressive about it.. I am totally okay with that. I won't hold it against anyone.

Anyways.. to the point. My conceptualisation of ESFPs is one of The Hedonist. And I don't mean Greek Philosophy.
I'm talking about someone with no or min values with complete priorities serving the material experience of desires. 

If you have seen the movie Spring Breakers, you can have an idea of what I mean here. 

Okay. You may now feel free to correct me.",1580834955
ESFP,"I wrote up a list of what I believe makes me an ESFP. Let me know if you relate to or disagree with any of the below!

1. Non Judgemental


ESFPs prefer to see the good in everyone. They are open minded and quite comfortable with accepting other‚Äôs differences, even if they don‚Äôt personally agree with them, as long as they don‚Äôt severely clash with the ESFP‚Äôs personal values. The worst thing to an ESFP is when someone tries to impose their values onto them. 


2. Social Chameleon


ESFPs have a talent for being able to get along with different types of people by reading a room and matching its energy. Whether it‚Äôs a party or a book club, ESFPs can change their energy/demeanor to one that fits appropriately to the setting.


3. Small Inner Circle


Even though they may have a large number of friends and acquaintances, ESFPs tend to only have a few select people they can trust and feel comfortable enough to share their most private inner thoughts and feelings. 


4. Alone Time to Recharge


ESFPs love people and social settings, but need time alone to process their feelings and the events of the day. ESFPs need quiet time to self-reflect on their values and review/refine them to make sure they align correctly with who they are.


5. Gut Feeling


An ESFP has no problem trusting their gut when making a decision, because their gut feeling is heavily tied with their moral code and values. If their gut says yes, to an ESFP, there is no doubt.


6. FOMO: Fear of Missing Out


The thought of missing out on something fun is almost painful for an ESFP. With every occasion comes the possibility of something awesome happening, and they don‚Äôt want to risk not being there for it.


7. Seeing Both Sides


ESFPs can have trouble making a decision or choosing a side when they are able to see the validity in both arguments. This can turn into an unhealthy form of analysis paralysis, and frustrate others as they perceive the ESFP as wishy washy.


8. Likes People, but Not Everyone


Others may see the ESFP as a people pleaser who likes everyone, but this is only partly true. Yes, the ESFP naturally enjoy making others happy and are accepting of others‚Äô differences, but they will not waste a single breath on those who offend or breach their personal values.


9. Sensitive to Rejection


ESFPs are sensitive to criticism from others, especially from those who they have no problem with, and will take it personally. They‚Äôll often become stuck in their heads mulling over what they might have done wrong  for others to not like them, and find it hard to accept that not everyone will like you no matter how hard you try.


10. Communicates Literally


ESFPs will say exactly what they mean and not beat around the bush. They can be frustrated when others take a long time to get to the point, are passive aggressive, or use cryptic wording that requires reading between the lines. 


11. Attuned to Other‚Äôs Emotions


ESFPs have a natural knack for noticing sudden changes in facial expressions and are sensitive to others‚Äô feelings. This skill is useful for when the ESFP is engaging others and reading the room. This may however become an issue when the ESFP‚Äôs intuition is actually incorrect, which can lead to misunderstanding and misreading the situation.


12. Great in Crisis


ESFPs are surprisingly good at staying calm and efficient under crisis. It‚Äôs as if they enter a hyper focus mode where nothing else matters except finding the most efficient solution possible.


13. Trouble Putting Emotions into Words


Although the ESFP can experience strong emotions and often make feelings-based decisions, they can have trouble putting these emotions into words. They can often recognize what they‚Äôre feeling but may need time to process why they‚Äôre feeling that way.


14. Picture Perfect Memory (Selective)


ESFPs can be scatterbrained and forgetful at times, but have the ability to recall and visualize important memories with incredibly detailed accuracy. They will remember the sights, sounds, and smells that took place in that moment. It‚Äôs hard for an ESFP to remember names, but they will never forget a face.


15. Hates Inauthenticity


ESFPs are commonly judged as fake because of their natural openness towards others and positivity. People may be turned off by someone who seems happy all the time, not realizing that ESFPs also experience negative feelings, they are just more private about them. In reality, ESFPs hate inauthenticity and are incapable of pretending to like someone they cannot stand, even if they were paid to do so. Acting in a way that is not their natural selves will trigger the gag reflex in an ESFP.",1580794394
ESFP,"I do!..... rarely. Only thing is it‚Äôs usually cheesy and makes me cringe.

He also shows he's very passionate about wanting to get very intimate with me but as an ISFJ part of me wants to give in too soon and the other part fears if I give him what he wants this early he might become disinterested in me after a while

ESFP,"Hello all, 

I have a new boss. Unfortunately, we can't seem to communicate well. 

I hear she is using my name as a reason for why she her stuff isn't done right.  I'm trying really hard to help her, but honestly, many people are having a problem communicating with her and are getting frustrated with her lack of organization and always looking to others for (group think) instead of having a vision and not feeling like a leader. 

I think she's also losing respect for seeming to be more about leading through her social game. 

I'm not out to get her, but she is obviously using my name to blame for things she isn't doing. The way you can tell this isn't true is that she doesn't come back and bring me in her office to tell me how I underperformed. I hear through other people what she is saying. 

The fact that she doesn't tell me, shows that she knows it isn't true. I'm just a scapegoat. 

That said, I'm not trying to go to war with her. I'm not trying to sabotage her. So how I can build better raport with her? We seem not to be able to connect on a personal level. 

We have opposite Hero and Inferior functions. INFJ Ni - Se, ESFP Se - Ni. When I talk i see her looking at me like she can't figure me out. I've been nothing but friendly and respectful. Yet she seems to regard me with suspicion. 

My fear in the end, is that I work hard to gain a rapport, yet she'll have no problem continuing to throw me under the bus when it suits her. 

If there is a way forward, let me know how you might see that possibility. I would rather not have to go into self defense mode, as there is always a chance self defense mode can turn into self destruction mode, or at least, mutual self destruction.

ESFP,"I'm an INFJ dating an ESFP. In general I love his easygoing and calm demeanor. The only issue is sometimes it comes across as indifference or I'll take it as being ""lukewarm"" about our relationship. I can provide examples but in general, he's not one to say things like ""I'm crazy about you,"" ""you are amazing"" or ""I'm so glad we met."" 

Also, he never appears to outwardly care too much if plans change, if I can no longer hang out, etc. This is a great quality on the one hand, the issue is that often it comes across like he just doesn't care that much. This is what I initially assumed, however today I told him all this directly and he was surprised. He said he cares about me a lot and he wants me to meet his mom and take steps toward becoming boyfriend/girlfriend. After this conversation I felt a lot better, but I just kind of want to know how his brain works. I dated an ISFP at one point and we had this same issue (it didn't work out). The difference here is that this ESFP and I are able to transparently talk about it so I'm hoping we can improve. Can someone explain why an ESFP wouldn't text their significant other with something like this: ""Hey I want to go do XYZ with you, let's make dinner reservations at 7 p.m."" or ""I'm so happy we are dating and I enjoy being around you so much."" I don't get it because these are things I readily say as an extroverted feeler.",1579739978

ESFP,"hi, an ESTPf here. just recently got to meet this young ESFP guy and until know i haven't really gotten to know any ESFP male counterparts, except like once when i was 13.. this guy i now know seems really interesting, though, and feels like lots of fun to be around, but what bothers me a bit is his immaturity with how he acts and deals with more official things that we have to deal with in our work setting. after hanging out with him for a while it seems to come from a place of being rejected/hurt, so i just really want to help him being more comfortable with who he is and that he'd feel accepted. it seems like his actions tend to make this spiral of creating rejection and him hating it right after, so it's not very easy. 

so i wanted to know a bit of how ESFPs look like when they are older and matured &amp; healthy, and if there are certain things other people can do to help them reach that a bit easier. i've seen the unhealthy adults of all types so it's not like it will all happen naturally. even then, my intention is not to change him, as it's not my responsibility, but i do have this kind of older-sibling kind of feeling towards him and want to help, if possible.

i know that he doesn't tend to like if i state/show my opinions towards his actions too bluntly (even if i do make sure that he knows it's not his personality/identity i'm talking about, but his actions) so i want to be more mindful of that. any advice would be welcomed!",1579016714

ESFP,"Hi, INFJ here :) I‚Äôm dating an ESFP guy and while I really like many things about him (e.g. he‚Äôs confident, smart, fun, understanding, open-minded, etcetc), there are also some things about him that worry me.

1) He doesn‚Äôt seem to think much about the practical aspects of his future, like work, and treats it quite carelessly, and he doesn‚Äôt seem to like commitment very much. It comes off as him being lazy/unmotivated to take charge of his life. 

2) In person, he‚Äôs quite present and interactive, but when it comes to texting, his responses tend to be short and missing depth. I also want to feel involved in his life, and this makes it harder. He says he prefers to talk in person, which is fine, but it‚Äôs an LDR so we don‚Äôt get to meet very often, and we can only call sometimes when our timings match, so text is the only way to really stay connected. Although he‚Äôs been trying a little more since I talked to him about this which I appreciate. 

I know he‚Äôs trying to get his life in order, because he had some difficulties previously, and I really want to be patient and supportive, but as an INFJ I really can‚Äôt help but overthink and feel upset when he seems aloof, and worry about his future because I know he‚Äôs so capable and smart but he just doesn‚Äôt seem to do anything about it. 

I guess I‚Äôm just trying to understand how ESFP think better, their needs, and how I can be a better girlfriend to him without stressing too much? Any helpful comments would be appreciated, thank you!",1578923019

One day she's telling me how special I am to her, that she feels like such a weirdo but with me feels so comfortable, that being around me makes her happy, texting me in the middle of the night how much she loves me, wrote me a love poem, and out of nowhere, without ever talking to me about things that were bothering her dumped me cold.

I thought things were going really well minus a few minor hiccups and she was very much in love with me and happy with me and excited to do things she talked about in the near term future with me.  I have no idea what happened.

ESFP,"I'm a female INFJ and I've been dating a male ESFP for about 2 months. There are a lot of things I really like about him. He's easygoing, warm-hearted, fun, sensitive, confident and a lover of life. There are just a couple things I am having trouble working through and I really want to make it work. Hoping for advice from some other ESFPs who might understand firsthand.

1. Talking about ""abstract ideas"" and such. I love talking about the meaning of something, why people do things the way that they do, basically anything involving the ""why"" of things. Sometimes it feels like talking to a brick wall. For example, we were watching a television show last night I said ""wow there are a lot of underlying political statements being made in this show"" hoping to start a conversation about the topic and get into a little bit of depth. Instead, his response was ""Hmmm"" and then he proceeded to make a goofy comment about the outfit that a character was wearing. Other times, he won't really respond until like five minutes later. So that makes me think maybe it takes him awhile to process? I just don't know how the ESFP brain works. My question here -- is there any way to coax more depth from him in these kinds of moments? As an INFJ I need a bit of this to feel like my soul is being satisfied. I love the goofy comments and such too, but I need the serious discussions as well. 
2. The value he places in social approval. For example, his friends were over yesterday and the discussion got a bit misogynistic at least in my book. He does not think that way himself (I know this for certain) but rather than lead the group to a different discussion topic, he let it happen without saying anything. It's hard for me to understand this. If my friends were making racist comments or something for example, I would at least say *something* to shut the conversation down. In other situations -- when we have big groups of people, he tends to leave me to ""fend for myself"" and seems more concerned with fitting in with the group himself. It just seems that being in the ""in crowd"" is really important to him and he is not one to stand up for his values the way that I am. I would be interested to hear an ESFP's perspective on this. Why is ""following the crowd"" so important? It is just hard for me to understand as an INFJ where I will literally isolate myself from society if I don't agree with it and I give zero fucks what ""cool"" people think.",1578358903

ESFP,"I‚Äôve had a crush on an ESFP who went to my undergrad for the past 8 years since I graduated. Back when we were students, he was a year below and pursued me first, but then I immediately graduated and that was the end of it. He‚Äôs so sweet and energetic I thought he was gay at first. Silly me. He‚Äôs just a thoughtful, sensitive guy with the widest smile and tons of positive energy.  Very popular and ambitious and always on the go. 

We recently ended up in the same town for work stuff and saw each other for the first time since college and there were freakin‚Äô fireworks. He asked me to meet up and get dinner together, so he found a place  to eat after the one I suggested ended up being close. We were vibing and he invited me to his place, and we ended up chilling/making out/sleeping together. Def not something I do regularly, but I was feeling it since he‚Äôs such a gentleman and asked me deep, thoughtful questions and tried to make sure I was comfortable and complimented me with the sweetest words I‚Äôd ever heard a man say.  It was like out of a movie and I was putty in his hands, but he was putty in mine too so it worked out nicely. 

He paid for me to Uber home (had to peace onto quickly to catch a flight home and he seemed sad) and has been messaging me ever since. I‚Äôm not moving to his city for six months or so, but he seems to want to stay in touch. He travels for leisure and his job all but a few days out of the  month, so not sure what potential is there for a relationship. Since ESFPs are here and now kind of people‚Äîlike us ENFPs‚ÄîI‚Äôm wondering what you guys think of him in terms of how he‚Äôs acting based on how you‚Äôve acted with those you‚Äôve made a connection with. 

I don‚Äôt know what I want yet, but he‚Äôs pretty cool and it‚Äôd be good to see him again. You ESFPs have that combo of idealism and being action-oriented which is super attractive to those of us who overthink everything. Feeling optimistic but not obsessive. It‚Äôs a peaceful feeling that comes from how proactive he‚Äôs been, and being considerably older and wiser than when we first met.

For me, I have mixed feelings toward them. I actually like looking forward to the short term things like going to a movie later etc. because I know I have nothing better to do and I don't want to miss out on a chance to have fun with friends. I actually end up getting a large amount of motivation from feeling like I got something exciting ahead of me instead of just living every day just bleakly with no guarantee I'll ever have fun any time soon. 

On the other hand, I have extremely strong feelings against tying myself down to one person for *life,* like that crap is permanent unless I want to go through a DUMB ass huge amount of tears, paperwork and emotional/financial damage, plus if you choose the wrong guy, you'll miss out on a lot from life, and even if you choose the right guy, who guaranteed that he's not gonna change or you're not gonna change and it just won't work anymore?

ESFP," (TL;DR: Question for the ESFPs. How do you deal with possible situations which would be bad at a specific time like an unwanted pregnancy?)

That was the short version, now in-depth:

I'm (32, ENFP-A, type 2 closely followed by 7) in a polyamorous relationship with my husband (36, INFP-T, type 4) and my boyfriend (25, ESFP-A, type 7). They are not romantically involved with each other, but are good friends. My husband and I live together. And there are shared visions of all of us living together.

Hubby and I are somewhat ready for a child but we're not actively trying, since we have a lot going on in our lives, well especially he. We've been together for 14 years now and have a very happy relationship. He and I are very typically xNxP types as we're often in our heads, think through patterns, future-oriented emotional thinkers.

BF and I have been together for only about 6 months now. We're extremely happy and we're both in for the long run. I can't believe the luck I've had to find two soulmates like this... but anyways, BF is very typically ESFP. Very much lives in the moment, happy-go-lucky, if something isn't a problem right now - don't waste worry on it kinda guy. I love this about him, even 'though it can lead to neglecting plans that might be important for his life and organising his time is quite a task for him. He is 7 years younger than I and is in the middle of his studies at university and doesn't yet know what he'll do later and if he ever even wants kids of his own.

Now, I'm not really asking for advice, since my situation isn't real yet, but it made me think how ESFPs generally react to stuff like that. I'm about to get my period, I hope, but for some reason a part of me is afraid of being pregnant. There was some light nausea and unusual cramping which confused me, but I'm probably not pregnant. It would be my boyfriends for sure. (We did use a condom, but you know..)

If the universe would only revolve around me I'd be okay with it. I told him quite early in the relationship that if an accident should ever happen and I was to  get pregnant, I wouldn't have an abortion, I'm just not at the age and life stage anymore where I'd want to. He knows that. And we talked about it a couple times. Husband also knows that and is okay with it.

But the universe does not revolve around me and I think  pregnancy right now would be a really really really shitty thing for both my men at the moment. So, that's why I really hope I'm not pregnant - it can wait, I'm in no hurry.

But it's interesting to think about it: My husband would flip, I mean he'd be so overwhelmed and directly dive into a spiral of ""ohmygods"", because it would mean a lot of changes in our lives and it wasn't part of his future plans...

And with my bf: Even 'though I think it would be the worst for him (young, still studying, doesn't know if he wants kids ever) I think he'd be the one handling it the best, because of his one day after another approach on life.

That's where I come back to my question: Do ESFPs generally handle situations like this well or are they either go with the flow or flee the scene types?

I'm really good at retouching high end photography but I just lose confidence and energy for freelancing since there's a whole lotta initial work with no signs of payoff. I just don't want to work hard labor like plumbing or working on cars but I also want to be able to afford living??

He's usually busy with college and work, so we hardly ever get to hangout, but whenever we do it's really amazing and fun.

It's so easy for me to read him when we're in person, but in text it's extremely difficult. I hardly ever have a problem deciphering how a person is through text, but with him it's like I'm always second guessing everything. Another thing is that we hardly ever text each other, and whenever we do, I'm always the one to text first. Is that normal for an esfp?

I deal with anxiety and depression, and I know that esfps find it difficult to deal with people like that cus it drains them, so I try to ignore it as best as I can, but I can't help but feel like my emotions and feelings are being caged up with no way to express then or tell them to him - someone I trust.

The reason I would sometimes class myself as an INTP is because I do enjoy solitude, theories, logic and spontaneity.

ESFP,"
Hi. My ex is an ESFP and I'm an ISFP. 2 weeks ago, he sat me down and spoke to me about how he feels the relationship had gone stagnant. Before we got together, we shared alot about our past relationships and i know the scars he has had from previous relationships. During the relationship, we both had our guard up because of our history in other relationships. When he sat me down for that conversation, I think i had my guard up and started analysing how because of what happened, maybe he couldnt open his heart up or he is afraid of repeating mistakes. I have been very nice to him and he couldnt stress that enough. We decided to take a break and he cried when i left and said sorry. i have been a big part of his life. i was calm through the conversation. Over the week, my mind went crazy and i started analysing myself and texting him alot. I think i was also having PMS. he said i kept going back and forth with what i want and that he feels i turn myself into what i think he wants and its not what he asked for. He asked me to think about who i am and what i want. i think due to my crazinesss, he made a decsion to end things. I have asked for a conversation but he asked me to do it over a phonecall. my last text to him was to apologise for how intense the last week was and its cool we chill for awhile. My friends have found him back on Tinder.
At this point, i feel that he has made me aware of what went on and that I needed to fix myself. I still feel i would like to have a conversation with him to apologise for the further damage i have done to him by using his history against him. I would like to do so after I have fixed myself and not feel like i want him back anymore. I guesss my question is, how long should i take for him to be less angry about everything that has been said. I would sill like to have him in my life because he has been positive for me and ive supported him through therapy. How should i approach him. I have been reading abt his personality type and understanding that i shouldnt talk more about the past. What is a good way to apologise to an ESFP and how long later. Thanks for that.",1573958517

i loved berlin so much i even went as far as looking for an apartment over there, but i ended up coming back last week. things like this aren't much of a big deal to me as i've been moving around since i was 18 years old.

i have a really great job opportunity here in NY and if i just stay in one place for a change, success will come but i'm losing patience. i can't be where i am another minute. i cant have this same fucking routine and this same fucking life for another 6-8 months AT BEST until i have enough income to move out. realistically, i'm looking at a year from now until i can move out and i just cant do that. i want freedom i want to live my own life i want to be happy and i want to get back out there already and i can do so in berlin much much MUCH faster than i can do it here in ny. but if i stick around new york and finally reach that freedom, it'll be much sweeter than having it berlin. i'm so confused.

ESFP," I know what my ""possible"" type might be but I would rather you type me not knowing anything due to bias.¬†


I'm 21 years old and a female. I have always felt very different from others, misunderstood, underappreciated and in some cases walked over. (used to happen a lot as a child)


I'm empathetic, I care a lot about the underprivileged and about world issues although I know there isnt much I can do due to the established systems. I usually manage to chose who to empathize with, I think more in terms of sympathy rather than empathy. I always give money to the homeless.¬†


I can express my feelings in text, not in person. When I write I dont write very literally when it comes to my feelings, but rather metaphorically. Sometimes I just dont understand my feelings or why I feel the way I do, am I overreacting to things? I cant make sense of my feelings, which is why I usually seek outside perspective, asking people about if my reactions are sensitive- usually it is in terms of anger and frustration when I talk about feelings.¬†


I am very talkative when I want to talk about something I really enjoy, science, philosophy, politics, anything that you think about- that makes you theorize. I love theories and I love philosophy. Although I am talkative, I can be extremely quit and shy. I seek humans sometimes for connection when I feel too lonely, the only person¬† I have is my boyfriend. I love meeting new people but I can get bored very very easily if the person is extremely predictable- I dont like predictable people but at the same time if I cant predict them I get too stressed. I need to know their motives and how they function and how they react in certain situations, which is why I sometimes ""test"" people.¬†


I enjoy debating, seeing things from other perspectives and understanding WHY people think the way they do and what makes them think the way they do, which is why I have a fascination with national socialism, why would anyone adapt such an illogical ideology when it doesnt make any sense, from a scientific viewpoint? If it did then I would understand. I have a hard time accepting peoples views if they dont make sense, unfortunately, and I tend to get angry and emotional when someone elses argument doesnt make any logical sense- and if it is only based on their opinion and understanding of the world- I need theories that are based on facts, on some reliable foundation.¬†


I love reading, I have a vivid imagination and I talk to myself way too much. I enjoy theatre I would think and I like poetry. I just like to write down my thoughts and ideas, feelings and such since I just cant express them in normal form.¬†


I am very very kind, sometimes too kind, especially to strangers. I treat everyone the same- thats not even a rule I have, it just happens naturally.¬†I can be selfish at times, quite a lot actually. Just more of a ""me"" attitude at times, probably because of my parents spoiling me. I grew up in a fairly religion family but as long as I can remember I've always, compared to my siblings, been the one questioning God. 


I am in my first relationship right now, and it is not going very well. My partner is insensitive, whenever there is an issue I want to resolve it immediately, since I'm very direct. I don't want to move on or talk about it later, I want to talk about it now, why should I leave a problem unsolved? I hate uncertainty more than anything, I need to know that we are good so I can be ready to settle down and plan for my future.¬†


I feel like a walking alien, living a life I have not chosen to live but am thankful for, trying to find my purpose in life every day, my passion, what I want to do forever. But since my Interests are wide I can't. I've always been the weird kid in school, the oddball but never really bullied- strangely so. I just have never felt in place in this world, and it feels like no one thinks the way I do. Everyone says that I think in a different way. I'm lazy but with ambition, I have potential to do lots of things and I am very optimistic about everything. I always wonder about things. So, I apologise for the long text, what time would you say I am, according to what I have written?¬†

Come to find out all of my clothes that were in bags because my father was redoing the floor in my bedroom are gone. Thrown away. Forever. The hundreds of dollars worth that I worked so hard to collect. I'm poor okay. 

I have a somewhat rocky relationship with my dad. He was overbearing when I was young. Had to leave when I was 12, came back 10 years later this June. I don't hate him, I understand him... I do however hate my aunt, she was supposed to be our foster mom/guardian.

I don't want to make this post too long (I have another one on my profile about him, titled Unhealthy HSP Parent) if you'd like to help. 

But I feel like I'm constantly teater-tottering on emotions with him. Can't use logic with him because it doesn't click. I love him but he's like a crackhead without the crack lol literally

He came back in June, maybe I have been spending too much time with my boyfriend? And the wedding through him off kilter? Him coming back is a huge deal and I guess maybe i should be staying at home more to avoid negative feelings? Is 2 weeks with my boyfriend pushing it?  I stayed home the whole summer... is that not enough for him ?

How can I know how to keep him balanced and in good spirits? I am an ISFJ by the way...",1571174130
ESFP,"I dont really have a say on politics, economy, etc. I have strong opinions on a handful of things, but when people discuss ""adult topics"", I'm quickly bored. Its not that I dont care - I just value my friendships more and know that whatever I think doesnt matter at all and wont ever make a change. 

I'm fine with this - its great not reading the news and not getting angry - but people tend to think I'm shallow because of this when I'm not",1570850798
ESFP,"Ok guys, I need to know how other ESFP stay at home parents manage.  I have been doing it now for 14 years and I am going crazy!!  I feel so claustrophobic, I feel like I have zero freedom, I feel like I have no contribution to the world, I also love being a stay at home mom because its so random and I do feel such a satisfaction that my kids have said they love having a stay at home mom to come home to.  Im just soooooo BORED!!!!!!  Like fuck, I am BORED!!!!  Going to kids activities do not help me either!  Those places arent entertaining to me, but my kid is happy and loving life.  Its so hard for me to stay positive sometimes and I often lose my temper because I just need to get away some times!  Please tell me I am not the only one that struggles with this!",1570726371

ESFP,"So my mum is a definite ESFP (I'm an INFP), but due to various life traumas is deeply troubled by self-hatred, guilt and what I can only describe as a complete fear of silence. She sleeps with the TV on, she talks CONSTANTLY and becomes visibly anxious when no conversation is happening. She's an alcoholic, her drinking is not as bad as it used to be because she very nearly died, but it seems to be worsening again. She has so many wonderful qualities and so much love to give but all of this is making her unbearable to be around.

She's basically unwilling to properly engage in therapy and has tried antidepressants but stopped taking them. I tried to get her into mbti and bought her a esfp self-help type book but it's as though she's afraid of any level of introspection. 

I guess I wondered if this subreddit had any light to shed on how I might be able to help her.

Thanks for reading.",1570124373
ESFP,"I was trying to see my siblings' mbti and I was analyzing my 11 year old sister's and I think she's and esfp for the following reasons:
. She's kinda weird but in a cute and fun way.
. Everyone loves her  activeness and energy.
. She has many friends and loves attention, always wants the spotlight to be hers.
. She's really creative, oddly she's bad at drawing but has many creative ideas in clothes and maybe dolls.
. She loved controlling people. Her infp twin brother always feels controlled by her, even I do. She always wants to tell people what to do.
. She's sweet and sensitive especially when others are sad.
Is my analysis right?",1570032044

Hello everyone on this subreddit! I am currently writing a story where one of my main protagonists has the ESFP personality type, and thought it would be a good idea to come here and ask for some advice. I want to explore more outside myself and talk to people who have this personality type to maybe establish my character to be more interesting or even gain some new perspective on her.

Here are a few questions I have and I would love some general advice too. Thanks : )

What are some flaws that you struggle with?

What would you say is your greatest strength?

Do you have any quirks or things you do that you feel are unique to yourself? /What‚Äôs a hobby of yours?

Is there any advice you want me to know personally about your personality type?

Thanks for the help!",1569911356
ESFP,"Growing up;

Mom - ENFJ - super sweet, so so naive!!  We fought a TON during my teen years. She never understood my freedom needs and my impulsivity. She tries to ‚Äúfix‚Äù everything but we are very close now. 

Dad - ISTP - Fierce temper, but we got along amazing!!  I felt like I was his clone and until we did personality tests, I was sure we could‚Äôve been the same type. His typing couldn‚Äôt have been more accurate though. He also saved lives for a living, so made sense. He taught me how to be super handy and helps me with projects all of the time. 

Older sibling - ISFP - Never have fought more with anyone like I did and still do with this sibling. We can‚Äôt seem to really trust or fully enjoy each other

Older sibling - INTJ - Super easy to get along with and I would say we were and are as close as you can be with an INTJ

Younger sibling - ISFP. As kids, we were very close and even closer as adults. We do struggle a lot with communication as he thinks I sap his energy. He says he can‚Äôt converse as quickly as I do and so with this info, it‚Äôs helped my communication with the older ISFP. 



Now with my own family

Me- ESFP - obviously the coolest type

Husband- ENTP - I find him fascinating and also incredibly boring. üòÇWe do things very differently but we have had a pretty awesome marriage. 

Child- INFP

Child- INFJ

Growing up we pretty well understood each other. I of course was so frustrated with being the ESFP because NO ONE TALKED in my family. Haha. So I was definitely the annoying one but we had some crazy shenanigans in this home with all of the sensors and the INTJ was probably the second most ballsy next to my ISTP dad. It was a wild and fun household. 

With the family I created, man alive I struggle sometimes as the only sensor!!  Everyone in my house is pretty cautious and stuck in their heads all of the time. The kids especially, yikes, so so sensitive!  üòÇ. It makes it very challenging for me to understand them and to curb my insensitivity sometimes. Also, any other ESFP‚Äôs stay at home parents??  I‚Äôve been one for 14 years now and it feels like a prison sometimes. If I could choose again, I wouldn‚Äôt be a SAHP but this is the life I chose and so I choose to enjoy it to the best of my abilities. The same routines and seeing the same walls all day every day is torture sometimes.

ESFP,"I‚Äôm 22F &amp; dating. I want to find love, but I think I mess myself up by having sex easily without having higher standards for myself. 

A big part of me just wants to sleep with people early on because I love sex and intimacy. However, I know doing so likely won‚Äôt help me find a good partner. Once I sleep with someone I don‚Äôt know very well, I don‚Äôt care to keep building a relationship with them. Maybe I have low standards or have a difficult time waiting until I care about a person and be vulnerable during sex.. unsure.

anyways, I ended up asking her to hang out outside of work.. and she said she's busy with her two jobs, so we agreed to talk on lunch break, and it went well!

two days later or so, I followed up and asked if she wanted to get coffee outside of work, WHEN it's a better time for her.. 

and no reply.. she then slowly backed away. 

next day at work (retail, different departments we work in), she thought I would be dramatic or act different, but I was very casual and respectful like nothing happened at all. I've been this way ever since, so about 5 weeks..

anyways, lately at work she will go out of her way to talk to me... 

like at the end of the night, i'll still be closing up my department, and she'll be on her way out.. she'll walk by and say ""bye (my name)!"", or say ""night (my name)!"", both with a smile.

She's an ESFP, i'm an INFP and the conversation went surprisingly well, we related in unique ways and even planned to talk on break at work!

For a few weeks, things went pretty well..

Then I began over-sharing, sending long msgs encouraging her etc and she slowly backed away..

I had a major breakthrough and epiphany, and my eyes were just opened to how wrong my actions were..

I told her this and sincerely apologized, and got no response from her..

Time past and I asked if everything okay, and received no response.

I never bring anything up at work and act as normal as always, am wry respectful..

It just hurts that I've sincerely apologized, probably even more
than I should... pour encouragement into this person and she won't at least tell me what's going on..

ESFP,"Hiya, I'm a ISFP/ESFP mix. Could you help type me? (I'm mildly autistic so I may not seem very feeler like)

I'm not all that introverted. I've always enjoyed socialising but I lose energy quickly and randomly which is pretty annoying. It doesnt follow a pattern either, so I could be out and I would suddenly fall very tired. Other times I can keep going for ages and really enjoy myself! I have pretty bad social anxiety which stops me from making friends, seeing friends, going out quite a lot. But without that, I know I would like making friends and just having a great time with them.
I'm definitely a feeler, but I lack empathy and quite a lot of emotion sometimes due to some weird emotional detachment I have which I've never been able to understand. I place more value on my heart than my head, and I've always loved making relationships. However, I'm not particularly loving, and I get angry when someone becomes too emotional or overreacts, like my dad does ü§¨ I also hate conflict, and I do remember lots of times when my parents or my friends would argue and I would just have to run away with a face full of tears üò∂ I still do that. I enjoy expressing myself and standing out, i cant be a nobody!! I struggle to be creative even though i enjoy it because i have issues with imagination. I dont do much creative stuff anymore because it hurts to know I'll never be able to properly. I'm quite hurt when I make mistakes.
I'm pretty flexible and spontaneous but not as much as I know I want to be. I need some order in my life, I need a little bit of routine to get me through. But I prefer to make decisions that can be changed and I hate commitment too.

ESFP,"[MBTI was inconclusive between a few types](https://www.reddit.com/r/MbtiTypeMe/comments/co7jp8/please_type_me_im_so_confused/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app) so I'm trying to find input to see which one fits better :-)

**1) What do you yearn for in life? Why?**

I really just want to have the freedom to live the way I want. If I want to sit on the computer and look at memes until 3am then I'm free to do so, if I want to eat out and eat junk food then I'm free to do so, etc. Large commitment like marriage and having kids and stuff like that makes me extremely uncomfortable and even a bit pissed thinking about it because you can't do anything or hang out with your friends because you're constantly cleaning and fighting and changing diapers etc. I want to be able to get involved in activites and community revolving around my interests and I'll end up skating around anything and everything that prevents me from doing that

**2) Think about a time where you felt like you were at your finest. Tell us what made you feel that way.**

I felt on top of the world when everything seems to be going right, all my favorite online communities are alive, my grades are fine, I'm on my parents' good side and we go out a lot, nobody is 'on my case' and trying to monitor everything I do, my friends invite me out, and I have events to look forward in the coming days. I feel happy when it's like that because I can enjoy myself and not have to worry about anything and have something to look forward to as well. It's a really happy feeling.

**3) What makes you feel inferior?**

When I try to speak up in a group of people and they all just stare at me stoicly and show this contempt that gives off this ""f you"" vibe. This happens especially with random adults that I try to talk to since I'm young. Or when I say something or do something and someone yells a varient of ""who do you think you are"" or ""who do you think you're talking to"" that makes me feel very small too. 

**4) What tends to weigh on your decisions? (Do you think about people, pro-cons, how you feel about it, etc.)**

It depends.. if I'm choosing a short term thing like maybe an area to hang out at, I would probably base it off of ""hey the vending machine actually works there"" or ""yeah that other place has a lot of mesquitos"" or ""they have faster wifi"" etc. But if it's a long term thing like a college, I'd choose based on what they have available, what kind of people I would make friends with there, how close it is to the city, and am I going to be able to do the things I love there etc. 

**5) When working on a project what is normally your emphasis? Do you like to have control of the outcome?**

If it's a school project 99% of the time I'm not even going to want to do it lol. So I'd probably procrastinate a lot and then when I finally start doing it I'll put a lot of emphasis on what's required of me and the specific instructions and what I need to do to not fail and get that done as fast as possible and then if I'm actually remotely interested in it I'll go back and add more quality. If it's a group project, I just sit my booty on my phone until someone tells me what I need to do to contribute and help out and I'll do that and then be done lol. 

**6) Describe us a time where you had a lot of fun. How is your memory of it?**

I went to a large dinner with like 30+ people and I had some margaritas and took a lot of pictures, ordered a ton of desserts, told stories and laughed a lot and those 5-6 hours only felt like a few minutes to me because one funny/cool thing after another kept happening and it was like a non-stop stream of awesomeness and I never wanted to leave. I still remember it very well since it was an extremely significant event in my life. It changed my perspective a lot, it gave me a lot of faith in humanity and showed me that holy crap I didn't know people could be this nice and fun.

**7) When you want to learn something new, what feels more natural for you? (Are you more prone to be hands on, to theorize, to memorize, etc)**

It really depends what I'm learning. If im learning how to cook a meal I remember it better if I watch someone do it in front of me or do it myself. But if I'm learning something like the world maps, I tend to link the country names to something important to me (my friend was from X so now I'll never forget where it is on the map). If im learning how to use a new software then I'll start trying to find the basic features (how do I save? how do I set my profile picture? can I see my friends list?) and then familiarize myself like that. It reaaaaally depends though and I don't learn everything exclusively with one style

**9) How organized do you to think of yourself as?**

I only organize the things that matter to me I've noticed. Like, my locker can look like a landfill and my clothing drawer has no system to it whatsoever, but I also have folders and discord servers and photo albums that I've spend hours designing and making it organized so I can find everything in 1 second and it looks satisfying. But I can only find the energy to do that if its especially personally relevant. Everything else is a tornado

**10) How do you judge new ideas? You try to understand the principles behind it to see if they make sense or do you look for information that supports it?**

I think I tend to figure out how it works first?  like for MBTI I went straight to ok what do these letters stand for, what do they indicate, how do you decode the letters into a cognitive function stack, what do the cognitive functions stands for, how does this add up with me, etc. I really have no idea (I spent like 45 minutes on this question lol üòÇ)

**11) You find harmony by making sure everyone is doing fine and belonging to a given group or by making sure that you follow what you believe and being yourself?**

I think I definitely feel more at peace with the latter, I don't think I really pay attention to if everyone in the group is feeling fine and even if I did notice I wouldn't have the slightest idea what to do :/. On the other hand I feel very at ease when I'm allowed to express my excitement about an interest or a value and if I'm being critised or pushed down for it I consider that to be 0% harmony

**12) Are you the kind that thinks before speaking or do you speak before thinking? Do you prefer one-on-one communication or group discussions?**

I'm absolutely a speak-before-think person. To this day I still get dirty looks after blurting something out and regret it. It's a big issue since my childhood and I barely think things through and I've gotten screwed over many times. As for discussions I find groups to be a ton more fun, I feel like I'm not wasting my time when I speak (((assuming they're listening, and assuming the group didn't just break up and start a bunch of one-on-one micro convos))). And when my mind goes blank, I can rely on other people to prevent the awkward silence, and generally I feel more excited to speak up. Whereas one-on-one can be beneficial depending on the topic or if it's really personal or something, I just think it would be kind of stale if I had the choice between that or the group.

**13) Do you jump into action right away or do you like to know where are you jumping before leaping? Does action speaks more than words?**

This was a tough one for me and I actually had to ask a good friend who knew me very well about this lol. They said I'm definitely more of a leap first person and I don't do much thinking but this could very well just be my age. I'm p young. Also I think words can have a lot of meaning, I know that when I screw up I write apology essays and I know if someone writes one for me, I'll definitely acknowledge it and be touched by it. Actions are important too, I try to make sure I don't contradict my words but when I do and then the other person loses trust in me I dont blame them. They both have weight but just for different purposes. 

**14) It's Saturday. You're at home, and your favourite show is about to start. Your friends call you for a night out. What will you do?**

This actually happened to me the other week lol!!! I was about to binge watch the office with a bowl of cheese balls when my friend called and wanted to go shopping. I was extremely hyped and jumped right out my chair to go meet them. There's no way I'm turning down an invitation to go out. Netflix is always there for me later

**15) How do you act when you're stressed out?**

When something bad is *actively* happening, for example my parents going through my web history or going through my room, during that kind of stress, my stomach physically feels sick and I really just start shutting down yet feel jerked awake at the same time. I can't do anything so I just stand there, actually physically shaking, feeling helpless because there's nothing I can do, and I start thinking bad things like ""Did I forget to clean my history?? They are going to find my X account, and then they're gonna dig around in my email and force the password out of me and go on a tangent and then find everything I've worked for and take it away from me and I'm not going to have a phone or Internet connection ever again and I have to buy a computer in secret somehow and run away and I'll be living life against my own family just to get my crap back"" and just go down that rabbit hole and start thinking what can I do to get out and if I can't get out I'll feel hopelessly trapped. All this turmoil and on the outside I'm simply unmoving, sweating, and have a straight face

**16) What makes you dislike the personalities of some people?**

I really really hate it when people are aloof and judgemental and indifferent especially when I'm being really excited about something or just simply trying to talk to them. I've met people who give off the impression of a snobby cult leader, and every word just seems to be going up their ass and it's a waste of time to talk to them. It's the kind of vibe that would make you feel like saying ""F*** YOU TOO"" even if they didn't say anything. Their body language and responses say it well enough. So stoic and stand offish.

**17) Is there anything you really like talking about with other people?**

I looooooooove talking about funny stories with people. Like I'll tell them about the time I sprayed some random crap and ruined the wall as a child and they'd tell me about another story about their experience or what they did as a child too. Just laughing at situations that weren't funny at the time haha. I also like talking about things that I'm interested in, like cats and what my cat does and what theirs does etc. If Im lucky I'll find someone who heard about MBTI but they're rare and they usually don't even remember their letters 

**18) What kind of things do you pay the least attention to in your life?**

I don't pay attention to how I'm pervievd by others. This applies in a lot of ways. I don't care about my appearance, if I want to wear a T shirt and jeans they are comfortable for me and I don't care if I'm looking formal or impressing anyone. Of course I take care of my hygiene and don't want to smell bad but honestly I'm not a big fasionita either. I also shout blunt stuff sometimes like if someone hands me their business card I was like ""OH this is the company that screwed me over!!"" and then they're kind of offended. Also little things like dropping the entire spoon into the soup bowl and not noticing that the next person has to dig it out etc. I'm kind of a jack ass like that but I'm working on it

**19) How do your friends perceive you? What is wrong about their perception? What would your friends never say about your personality?**

A couple of my friends have said that I was very quiet at first, but then I started being talkative later. I think I was quiet mostly because my parents were closely watching and I was scared to get in trouble or say something that would get me screwed, or because I was face-in-phone and really absorbed in what I'm doing. Another group of friends see me as very vulgar because when there's absolutely no boundaries I start making really dirty jokes lol. One of my friends commented that I see the beauty in everything. Another friend sees me as polite and give more than I take. And my parents see me as outgoing, aware of my surroundings to an extent, and sometimes inappropriate and imposing and interrupt a lot. Somebody called me a lazy sloth too lol. It seems like the different people have different perceptions. But they all never seem to describe me as thoughtful or reserved or authoritian or anything like that.  

Edit: I asked around some more and people said that I was idealistic (like for example I go to an extremely crappy restaurant and somehow still think it's awesome even when it was obviously dirty and customer service was poor lmao)

**20) You got a whole day to do whatever you like. What kind of activities do you feel like doing?**

I would probably go downtown and eat out and sit on a coffee shop's wifi to chat on reddit or something and browse memes, or spend time with my friends and buy a bunch of junk food that I can never finish and use my phone a lot. It depends lol",1565715895
ESFP,"Greetings fellow typologists.

&amp;#x200B;

I am running an experimental Discord server around the idea of putting a limited number of each type together and just having discussions and interactions and seeing what happens. Though deep knowledge of typing systems or theories is not required, there are several who enjoy talking about it, and socionics is our most popular interest. 

&amp;#x200B;

We've been going for almost 2 months now with a small group but it's time to grow and attempt to fill out each type. I'm looking for 3 new ESFPs with the requirements that you are active enough to post several times a week and keep things civil and chill. Debates and discussions of all types are fine, but attacks upon others or anything that is done purely to troll or be divisive will not be tolerated.

&amp;#x200B;

Message me directly if you're interested, I will screen people somewhat but it will mostly be first come, first served.",1565659872

Neither of them completely describe me, but they‚Äôre both the closest to the mark. I personally don‚Äôt think labels like these really matter because you are who you are and you don‚Äôt need a label to define that, but it gets on my nerves when my friends ask me what my type is and I‚Äôm left to shrug.

ESFP,"Hello ESFPs, so I am curious to figure out a few things about ESFP friendships. Mainly, what makes you want to become a friend with someone? And most importantly, how do you maintain your friendships or how do you show your friends that they are important for you?

Interested in personal opinions, experiences, approaches. Tell me everything!",1565473766
ESFP,"Hi everyone!! I answered the questionnaire at 

1. I‚Äôm a 22 year old woman, I‚Äôm relatively short, in decent shape, and I really like wearing make-up. My natural hair color is brown, but I‚Äôve had purple, blonde, and red hair at different points over the past year or so.
2. I have ADHD that I take medication for, and mild Aspergers, I don‚Äôt know if that necessarily affects my mental stability though.
3. I‚Äôm an only child, and my parents divorced when I was 4. My mom had primary custody, so I lived with her and visited my dad every other weekend. Both of my parents remarried when I was relatively young. I have a complicated relationship with both my parents, they both have a lot of emotional problems that they never resolved or got treatment for. I‚Äôve been in weekly therapy for 4 years, so I‚Äôve been working through childhood trauma and I feel pretty at peace with everything. 
4. I‚Äôm currently entering my last semester of my bachelors degree, and I‚Äôm getting a Bachelors of Arts degree in music. I‚Äôve been a singer and performer pretty much my entire life, and that‚Äôs what I intend to do as a career as well. I write my own music, and I‚Äôm currently working on my debut commercial album. I broke a 3 year writers block a few months ago, and I‚Äôve been creating a lot since then. Music, art, and performing are my ultimate passions in life, and I love dedicating time to them.
5. If I had to spend an entire weekend by myself, I think I could go either way depending on the kind of week I had before. If I‚Äôve over-extended myself a lot prior to that weekend, then I‚Äôd probably be fine with hanging out by myself and just spending time in my own head. I tend to get under stimulated as well though, so if I wasn‚Äôt active enough the week prior, I would probably have a lot of pent up energy. If I could go out and exercise and be outside and burn off some steam though, I would be fine being by myself all weekend. I tend to get stuck in my head sometimes though, and if I‚Äôve been there too long, I have a hard time being by myself.
6. I love reading, writing, traveling, skiing, riding bicycles, hiking, learning new things, watching movies and documentaries, working out (although I‚Äôve been out of the habit for a while), and watching music videos and interviews. I ran cross country at the beginning of high school, but I wasn‚Äôt very good at it. I‚Äôm not super into sports, I prefer to exercise and spend time outside in an unstructured setting. I tend to get cabin fever in the winter because I get a lot of pent up energy when I‚Äôm inside and inactive too long. I‚Äôm pretty sensitive to heat and humidity too, so when it‚Äôs really hot out for a few days, I get cabin fever from being inside and inactive as well.
7. I consider myself a very curious person. I love learning about and researching new things, but I tend to overwhelm myself with information. A lot of the time, I learn about something just because I think it‚Äôs interesting, without any initial plan of doing anything with the info. I like to talk about interesting things I‚Äôve learned with my boyfriend, and I love sharing that info with him. I love books and I have a ton of them-I order a lot of them from amazon prime and I have a pretty big library. I love reading biographies about people who have made an impact on the world, mostly in the entertainment industry. I like to learn about their lives, and I try to figure out what made them successful, and what mistakes they made. Basically, I try to learn from their experiences. Most of the things I learn about are for my own self-growth. I love MBTI and the enneagram, and I used to spend a lot of time learning about psychology. I don‚Äôt really spend much time learning about technology, although I do like to predict how it may affect general life and the music industry. I‚Äôve pondered existential topics like spirituality, reincarnation, and philosophy, but if I go too far with that I end up with a lot of anxiety. I‚Äôm interested in how the universe works, but I‚Äôm not very good at math, so I usually focus on the theory end of science.
8. I‚Äôm not sure if I would enjoy being in a leadership position. I think I‚Äôd enjoy motivating people and helping them reach their potential. If someone pisses me off or crosses a line with me, I don‚Äôt tend to be super tolerant of BS, but I‚Äôm generally a patient and understand person.
9. I‚Äôm not really a coordinated or uncoordinated person. I‚Äôve never broken any bones or been seriously injured, so I‚Äôm not particularly clumsy. I don‚Äôt consider myself super graceful either though. I like playing instruments, so I‚Äôm good with my hands in that sense. I‚Äôm not very good at drawing though, and I don‚Äôt really enjoy tinkering with machinery.
10. I‚Äôm very artistic. I write and perform my own music, and I like to come up with visual concepts for my music. I‚Äôm drawn to dreamy, kind of surrealistic imagery, I love old movies(black and white or technicolor). Color is really important to me, I‚Äôm profoundly affected and inspired by aesthetics.
11. I tend to not think about the past unless there‚Äôs something I can learn from it, or unless I‚Äôm writing or creating something about what happened in the past. I like to make the most of the present because of the general uncertainty of the future. I try not to worry about the future, I‚Äôd rather do my best in the present.
12. I have a hard time saying no when someone asks me for help with something, but I‚Äôve learned how to do that I can maintain my own sanity. I won‚Äôt help somebody if what they want me to do would enable them to be unhealthy. 
13. Yeah I mean I guess. It can be frustrating when stuff doesn‚Äôt make sense.
14. Productivity is important to me in the sense that I like to work towards my goals. If I don‚Äôt care about something, I don‚Äôt care too much about being productive and efficient.
15. I‚Äôd like to think that I‚Äôm not a controlling person, although I can be if I super stressed out. It‚Äôs usually pretty indirect though, I can be rather passive aggressive.
16. The activities I listed in number 6 are pretty much all my hobbies. Music is in there too.
17. I suck at the whole standard academic structure. I have a hard time turning things in on time if I‚Äôm taking a full class load. I get really overwhelmed and burnt out pretty quickly. If I don‚Äôt care about what I‚Äôm learning about, I just don‚Äôt really do it, which isn‚Äôt great. I kind of just need the freedom to do things in my own way in my own time. I can‚Äôt have anyone breathing down my neck and pressuring me either.
18. I‚Äôm not very good at breaking things down into pieces and prioritizing them. I just do things in the order that makes sense to me in the way that feels right. I just go with my gut for the most part.
19. I really want to make an impact on the world through music and art. Personally, I want to feel happy and fulfilled. I want to be intellectually and creatively stimulated. I want to give love and be loved.
20. I‚Äôm afraid of going insane, that‚Äôs a big fear of mine. Living a meaningless life and wasting my time and potential is another huge fear. I hate being bored, feeling stuck and uninspired, and feeling like I don‚Äôt have the option to live life the way that I want to.
21. The highs in my life have involved positivity, acceptance, excitement, creative inspiration and productivity. There‚Äôs been a lot of positive spontaneity, and I‚Äôve been surrounded by like minded people who I‚Äôve bonded with.
22. The lows in my life look like pretty much like the opposite of my highs. They‚Äôve been filled with depression, anxiety, boredom, a lack of creativity, and crippling loneliness.
23. I tend to do both of those things. I‚Äôm aware of my surroundings while I daydream, usually my surroundings have some influence on my daydreams.
24. I‚Äôd probably wonder how I go to that room and why I‚Äôm there. I‚Äôd probably just observe and take it all in, and then figure out what I should do, if anything.
25. It depends on what the decision is. I‚Äôll usually consider and weigh the options and pick the one that makes the most sense. I usually don‚Äôt change my mind after I‚Äôve made an important decision because I trust my gut in picking the right path.
26. I take a really long time to process emotions because I sometimes have trouble knowing why I‚Äôm feeling something, or what exactly it is that I‚Äôm feeling. Emotions are important to me, but I have a love/hate relationship with them. I don‚Äôt like being bogged down by negative emotions and being unable to get out of that rut.
27. It depends if it‚Äôs worth it for me to agree with them. Sometimes I‚Äôm just so over it with a conversation that I‚Äôll agree just so the person stops talking. If I enjoy the conversation and the person I‚Äôm talking to, I‚Äôll express my actual opinion on the topic, whether that‚Äôs in agreement with them or not.
28. I‚Äôm not a huge rule breaker, I‚Äôve never been in trouble with the law or anything like that. But if the rules are corrupt, then I think it‚Äôs okay to break the rules for the sake of the greater good. If the authority is corrupt or ignoring thhe will or wellbeing of the people, then I think that authority should be challenged.",1565472828

ESFP,"so last month I began messaging this woman my age (mid 20's)... we had been coworkers at this retail store all year, and because work in different departments, we never really talked much..

anyways, we learned thru messaging that we have lots in common.. she actually began opening up to me a bit, and there seemed to be a mutual appreciation for our unique parallels.  

last week things were really tough, and I reached out to her and asked if we could talk sometime... sent a somewhat long msg explaining, and no response... 

she blatantly ignored my text about me reaching out, and I really took it personally. 

and before that I asked if she wanted to meet up outside of work, and she told me she's busy with her two jobs... so I politely asked about when it's a better time for her, when she's less busy.. and she ignored me.

we seemed to connect over how tough our lives currently are last month when we began talking, she clearly showed appreciation for that just like I did... and it just hurts that she wouldn't at least give me a response? ignoring is worse than a ""no"" to me... 

and I've told her she can be totally honest with me, to not worry about hurting my feelings etc... she just so blatantly ignores those messages.

she doesn't seem like a hurtful, mean person at all... i know she's not, so what's up here? is she just maybe trying to not hurt anyone's feelings, doesn't want to be there for me in this way which would lead to us growing closer etc? 

She is going thru a very tough time, she's told me that when we first began talking...

Why would she do this? being ignored hurts a lot. I want to believe that she means well.

she's an ESFP btw.",1565454945

My ESFP girlfriend is having trouble understanding and we've been arguing which we never have before and with my birthday being just 8 days away I'm really struggling to try and smooth things out. Any advice helps thank you,1565411379
ESFP,"so a few weeks ago I began talking to this girl my age (mid 20's)

as we talked online, we learned we have lots in common, appreciated talking to one another..

We talked on a lunch break at work, went well..

a few weeks later my life got very tough, so I reached out to her and asked if we could talk sometime outside of work...
no response..

a few days later I tell her how tough things are, and she replied with ""why do you feel that way?"" and wrote a sentence about what helps her in tough times... but she blatantly ignored my long text where I was reaching out...

she just blatantly ignores my text when I  ask her this, or when I let her know she can totally let me know if she wants some space, etc. Always ignores.

She is going thru a very tough time, so maybe there's a reason why she's ignoring? 

Maybe she sees how fragile I am atm, and doesn't want to grow close when we're both vulnerable, doesn't want to hurt my feelings, isn't sure etc? I've been very adaptable and selfless with her..

She basically shuts down when I say things like this... 

Why do you think she's this way?",1565288761

ESFP,"I know it's a weird combo, but it's def real and def a curse. I've seen a few other ESFPs who struggle with it and it's pretty awful, so I'm wondering if anyone here has some experience to share! Most of my issues come from being extremely isolated growing up homeschooled k-12, I had no friends by ""high school"" and only saw people once a week at a church which had really fucked me up already, and being transgender. So I'm extremely aware of how people perceive me and how many will avoid or hate me because of my expression. Often times it causes me to shut down and just avoid people, but then that also absolutely destroys me as an ESFP. It's something I'm trying to improve, but my self confidence is just so low it's often a struggle to even order food places. So if anyone has some experience or advice I'd love some :)",1564896928
ESFP,"I‚Äôm a lesbian ISFP and tired of reading how much the stereotype of ESFP women is like, ‚Äúairheaded hedonistic sorority women‚Äù or some crap. It‚Äôs just edgy misogynistic bullshit devaluing skills and talents that aren‚Äôt stereotypically NT or SJ. Which is something that I also face as an ISFP on MBTI communities. I really value and admire aesthetics and people skills, and I think ESFP women are talented, attractive, and brilliant. I used to work for a retail operation in which I was a back end customer support position for front end salespeople and it was pure joy to work with those ESFPs. I am so enamored with ESFP women tbh.

ESFP,"Hey guys, I sometimes type as an ENFP, I sometimes rarely type as an ESFP. I have tested as an ESFP on 16 Personalities, on the Big 5 test (SCUAN) and I took a cognitive functions test and I have high Se but also high Ne...I think it might seem like I have high Ne because of my severe ADHD, which causes me to be all over the place. I'm a 279 sx type

Some things that think I'm an ESFP: 

I'm not often stuck in my head, though I can be...when I was working at WalMart (hellish job btw), I would listen to audiobooks while stocking shelves and I would listen to audiobooks of lectures...I sort of would end up thinking and discussing things about the book in my head, I think. This was a while ago.

I know how most parts of a car work simply by reading about them, and I can explain it to you. I have trouble actually working on cars, though I can do basic stuff. I can also explain how nuclear reactors work simply by reading about them.

I'm super expressive with my emotions...if I'm sad, I have to talk to a friend or I'll go insane.

I don't like abstract concepts like the universe or the meaning of life or that bullshit. I have more important things to worry about.

THINGS THAT MAKE ME THINK I'M AN ENFP:

I can plan for the future well...I was told ESFPs don't really do this. I have the names of my kids picked out, the fact that I will be married and happy. I don't know where my future is but I get my joy and connect to people by talking about what we will do, not what we have done.

I'm scatterbrained. I'm random. Make strange connections in my head.

Two of my favorite authors/actors, Mark Twain and Robin Williams were ENFPs...

&amp;#x200B;

Things that go either way:

I like knowing and thinking about how things work, not why they are the way they are. I want to know how the car works, not why it works. If I know how it works, I can figure out why it works. For example: Cars, other machinery, etc.

I flirt with literally everyone and LOVE flirting with people...I know I'm doing it too.

Super impulsive.

1) Has your significant other/your relationship ever made you feel contained/held down? If so, what was going on that made you feel that way? Did you try to talk about it/work through it?

2) Have you ever felt like your partners happiness was/is dependent on you? Or that they were sucking out your energy in a reliant way?  If so, what was happening that made you feel that way?  Did you try to talk about it/work through it?

3) If there was something your partner was doing that was irritating you or something in the relationship wasn't working for you or there was something you needed from your partner to make you happier in the relationship have you spoken to them about it or tried to imply/hint at it?  Or did you feel like that would be changing the person and you didn't want that?

4) Ever feel like your partner loved you too much?  What was going on that made you feel that way?  Was that a negative in your mind?  If so, how did you handle it?

5) Have ever dumped a significant other with no prior conversations/warnings/anything of the sort and it was a complete shock to your partner, what happened? What preceded the break up (feelings/thoughts/circumstances)? Why didn‚Äôt you try to talk to your partner about whatever it was that wasn‚Äôt working/that you needed?",1564407350

ESFP,"Hi I'm going into my second year of undergrad but my GPA last year was rather depressing. I know that it's primarily due to my lack of commitment to something once it becomes boring. I feel that if I study by myself, I have a good chance of slacking off somehow. On the other hand, with others I tend to be more distracted because of the high possibility of socializing about some non related topics. Anyway, what are methods do you have to keep your mind focused on the books?",1564271780
ESFP,"Dear ESFPs,

You are all geniuses of the physical realm. I have never met a healthy ESFP that wasn't willing to see the best of things or try to have fun, no matter how difficult life gets. I've been fortunate to have had an ESFP partner for 4 years who has treated me with kindness and grace, nonjudgemental as he pushes me face-first into the grindstone of life and tells me to ""LIVE, dammit, LIVE!""... and I think we all need someone like that in our lives.

INFJs frequently tout them/ourselves as wanting to save or change the world in significant ways, and I see ESFPs as being the goal of what people should be as a result of changing the world: In the present, utterly expressive, shameless for oneself and nonjudgemental toward others. A 'live and let live' approach that also welcomes (kind!) others with open arms.

I love how inactive your sub is, if only because I have a gut feeling most of you are out experiencing life rather than ruminating over it. All I can say is *thank you* for those beautiful, rare moments you take a moment to talk to withdrawn and aloof-seeming folks like myself, and make our days brighter with your kindness, empathy, and unshakeable desire to enjoy yourself and your life.

Thanks for coming to my TED talk, you're all beautiful people!

Sincerely,

ESFP,"Some of you may know this story, but there was this ESFP guy who I liked a lot and who told me he liked me a lot...he is the closest thing I've felt so far to a soulmate connection. It ended up not working out between us because he had been so hurt by a previous break-up that he didn't want to be in a relationship and he wasn't doing well in school and really wanted to focus on that. It was a really bad ending for us - I was super dramatic, he was super avoidant, etc. Fast forward two years later and I run into him as he's graduating. We hug and I congratulate him and he says he's moving to my neighborhood. He tells me that we should hang out, go climbing together etc. I say ok, am in a bit a shock.

I don't reach out for months because I didn't really have a need or want to. I finally did a few days ago and just asked him if he was settling in ok and if he had started working yet. He never replied. It made me feel really stupid and self-conscious when I had no intention of being anything more than friends since I am dating someone that I really like. 

I saw him from far away tonight, walking his dog and it just made me pretty upset and hurt that he never replied. Why do you guys (or this particular ESFP) do this kind of thing? Why even tell me you want to hang out if you don't? :(",1564106888

Ever since she‚Äôs come back this summer she seems to be pushing me away. I don‚Äôt know what I did. I was so looking forward to her coming back this summer cause I wanted to spend more time with her and just become a better friend. But it‚Äôs like I don‚Äôt even have a chance to do that.

I‚Äôve just been feeling so neglected by her. And I‚Äôm becoming so lonely cause I have like nobody. And she knows that to. She once said that I was her only friend that she actually liked hanging out with back here at home.. but now I‚Äôm starting to feel like that‚Äôs not even true. She‚Äôs been hanging out with her friend/ at church more then me. It just sucks cause she‚Äôs finally back home for the summer. She‚Äôs literally 20 minutes away and I still don‚Äôt even see her.

Later that day she posts on her snap story that she‚Äôs at the fair with her friends... didn‚Äôt even ask if I wanted to go when she knew that I wanted to hang out with her.. like thanks for making me feel even lonely.

im an esfp. my dad is an esfp. two of my close friends, one male and one female, are also esfp's. (my BEST friend is an esfj tho hahaa).

its awesome with my dad, he gets me more than my mom and he has the same zest for life. we love going out and sightseeing, getting food and coffees.

i had a mad crush on my male esfp friend and we ended up fooling around for a bit. it was intense and ended pretty quickly bc we decided it was better for our friendship, and its kind of insane but now we're completely back to normal and platonic, even though theres like... i guess a bit of underlying sexual tension still going on.

my esfp lady friend is awesome. we have similar energy levels and totally understand each other's frustrations. however i feel like since we're so similar, sometimes we just don't really... click? its great having someone like you, but you get what i mean-- i feel like we're constantly competing for the spotlight, consciously or not.

run down i thought itd be cool to talk about esfp-esfp interactions in a parental, romantic and friendship dynamic. 

is it awesome? yes.

is it also not so awesome? yes.

we vibe off each other, its an amazing feeling to find someone so much like you, but simultaneously we have flaws and weaknesses that are harder to fix when we're together. e.g. like two drug addicts doing crack together (obviously not that destructive but its a metaphor!!) feels hella good but also feeds into the issues

my bestie is an esfj and i love that because i feel like she knows where my weaknesses are at, and i know hers. we're very similar but not completely alike to the point when we're blind to each other's weaknesses.

ESFP,"Hi fellow mbti nerds! 

I have always scored, and now score again, as an ESFP. But I have always recognized my way of thinking more in ENTPs, probably because I have an abnormal intelligence (&gt;150 IQ, graduated a master at 20 last year, graduating a top engineering this year at 21). 

Indeed I had a deep introspective time during which I was scoring as an ENTP, mainly because I double checked everything I was feeling and seeing by thinking it through, doing research and stuff. As far as I know it was more a self confidence drop/social anxiety peak. 

But now that I start working in engineering/consulting environment, I realize more and more that I don't give a golden shit about all the bullshit every one around me sees as essential to do their job. I want it to be here and now, and people centered. 

Probably I am going to have to undergo some radical career change but before I do that I want to know : where are the guys like me at ? Hiding in a crowd of seemingly less intelligent people (don't get me wrong, just more SF people) ? Hiding in a crowd of seemingly less naturally social and easy going people (like me with engineers)?

ESFP,"So there's this guy (20 M ESFP) who I've known for about six months now and it's getting blatantly obvious that he has a crush on me (18 F ENFP). This guy is a lot of fun and I enjoy hanging out with him, but I've never really developed feelings for him and I hadn't thought about him like *that* until I realised what was going on back in May. You guys are so over the top and usually I love it, but now that all that energy is being directed solely at me it's beginning to freak me out a little. I know you guys are naturally flirty (we ENFPs are too!) but I'm about 110% sure this guy likes me. The touching, the teasing, the fact he manages to sit next to me every time the squad hangs out, the 1000000 not-so-subtle compliments I've received, the fact his IQ drops down to about 5 every time I walk in the room and he seems unable to form a full sentence whenever I'm near him. The other day when we were leaving he jumped in the back of my car, moved my stuff, put his seatbelt on, and was fully ready to come home with me and my two friends. He wanted to go to a lookout or something? He just wanted to hang out some more I think. I had to very clearly tell him no about three times before he actually got out again. He tried it again the next time we hung out and I was like NO before he even sat down and I think he got the message. 

I don't know what to do with him because he hasn't actually asked me out yet. I feel like I can't just go up to him and be like please stop liking me, I don't reciprocate. He's probably aware of it. I've told him to please stop hugging me, please move over a bit so I have some space, please stop randomly *getting in my car* and he's listened, but without fail he always manages to find some new method. Me being an ENFP means I'm always just a bit too friendly with everyone and I've tried to tone it down a lot with him but when I'm in the moment I'll completely forget that I'm trying to tone it down and I go back to super friendly ENFP mode. 

Anyway my question is, what do I *do* with him? No one has ever been this forthright with me before and to start off with it was kind of adorable but now it's getting annoying. I really did try my best to see if I could develop feelings for him but I just... can't. There's no spark on my end. The rest of the squad thinks we would be cute together and I'm not getting any sympathy or help from them. If anything they're just making it worse by trying to set us up all the time. I'm moving away in two months, but I'm stuck with him till then. Is there something I could do or say that would be a massive turn off for him? When you've fallen for someone how do you turn it off? Is my best bet to just avoid him till I leave?

I do not know what to say or to do when he does that and he does not say a word either. That is so not his typical behaviour and I think it is kind of annoying. I do not want him to be different that he really is. What is that? What can I do (to make it stop)? What does he expect me to do?

I will share the information on [r/MBTI](https://www.reddit.com/r/MBTI/)when I have gathered enough data. Take the survey here: [https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/GJ668ZD](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/GJ668ZD)

Thanks in advance yall",1562770582
ESFP,"TL;DR Background: guy friend of 6+ years and I are heading off to college. I have feelings for him and was going to tell him but I‚Äôm almost 100% sure he doesn‚Äôt feel the same way. 

He never showed up to the event I hosted, so I got nervous and ended up not telling him how I felt. He also hasn‚Äôt contacted me at all this summer. He asked me to give him a hug at graduation and so I assume that‚Äôs what he figured was the last time I‚Äôd see him for a while.

I guess I should‚Äôve expected this, all throughout our friendship we‚Äôve never texted or hung out besides just in school, and even then it wasn‚Äôt much. I know he cares because he says he‚Äôs missed me a lot in the past and even talks to his family about me, but whenever we hang out he treats me like a sister or ‚Äúone of the guys‚Äù. I feel like an idiot for allowing myself to develop feelings for him when I‚Äôve obviously been friend zoned. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do now. ): I could ask him to hang out one on one, but I know I‚Äôll be a nervous wreck. Is it likely that I have been friend zoned?",1562642495
ESFP,"To put it short, I sometimes hate being the type I am. I also have learnt to appreciate and even be perhaps jealous of the skills and abilities ESFPs have in life.

But rather than just brood and pity myself, I figured I'd try to be productive and inquire from you: What impressions, weaknesses and flaws do you see in ENTP people most often? If there were a few things you would tell an ENTP person to learn from you to perhaps learn a bit how to be more succesful in life, career, women, friends, etc, what would you suggest?

Thank you for your time and comments in advance.

Have a good day/afternoon/evening.",1562395168

ESFP,"I love you people, especially my best friend. Thank you for spicing things up and keeping things interesting in any and all social situations. Thank you for caring about your friends and loved ones. I appreciate the work that y‚Äôall put into your crafts (whether it be your makeup, your music, art, outfit, home decor etc.,) 

I adore you people.",1562276212
ESFP,What do you think about that? (Probably nothing) How does it feel to be so superficial? How can you people look in the mirror? How does low intelligence feel like? Is there any honesty in yourself? Why do you smear make up on your face.,1562214112

ESFP,,1561833816
ESFP,"I've noticed depending on who I'm talking to, I kind of alter what I talk about. In that with some of my friends, I have very deep existential conversations with them, with others its politics, and there of course the shallow convos about celebrities or tv shows and whatnot. I realized I have a basic knowledge of a lot of topics, more than anyone else I know. For instance some of my friends dont know anything about current events so I can't talk to them about that but they do watch a lot of the same mainstream shows as me so instead we talk about that. Is this an esfp thing? Or I guess I like reading a lot so I do spend my free time learning a lot of random stuff on the internet lolol",1561720187

ESFP,,1560910945
ESFP,"Hi, could you tell me which type I belong the most?

‚Ä¢ How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.

22, Male, Business Student. 

‚Ä¢ Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?

I don't think I have any problems, at least as a child I was hyper active and didn't like sitting for too long, but it happened when I was with other people and not at home if I was alone with my parents.
Perhaps I was also looking for attention. 


‚Ä¢ What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?

I‚Äôm a Business student and I chose this degree because I‚Äòm interested in an important role at managerial level.

‚Ä¢ If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?

If I have any goals or interests to reach I would have no trouble spending a few weekends alone, but after a while I would need to go out, working out, play sports or something else. 

‚Ä¢ What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?

Before the University I played football every weekend, but then I stopped.
Now I go to the gym.
I don‚Äôt like mountain trip or something like that unless I have a strong interest. 

‚Ä¢ How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?

I'm curious, I like to inform and know, but only if interested in the topic.
I could spend many hours in research, have maximum 3-5 ideas, it depends on the topic and they arise after doing research and having thought about it, generally I tend to ‚Äúimprove‚Äù what I find more than ""inventing"".
As a child I liked to draw, but more than inventing I copied what I saw.  When I played the piano I was asked to compose a song, but I wasn't very good at inventing from nothing.
I was very curious about nature, animals and science and spent many hours looking for information and I also had encyclopedias.  Even during adolescence I tended to look for topics of my interest and photocopy the pages to put them in a binder.

‚Ä¢ Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?

From an early age I always wanted to be at the center, to feel like the leader and still today I want to be at the center of decisions, I was and I am very stubborn when it comes to deciding something and it often bothers me if others don't do what I want.
Sometimes I immediately make this clear, while sometimes I avoid it if it's not really necessary, but during childhood and adolescence I was prone to anger more often.
I think I'd be good, maybe I inspire confidence, but at the same time I could be a little too much ‚Äúmy way or nothing‚Äù.
Sometimes I could satisfy the needs of others, but at other times I am very firm about my decisions.

‚Ä¢ Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?

On an athletic level yes, I always liked running, playing soccer and doing bodybuilding and bodyweight, but I'm better at a physical level than in team sports because I often played in an individualistic way to be at the center.
I am very competitive, I want to win and if I lose I could act childish.

‚Ä¢Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.

As a child I liked to draw, I didn't invent but I copied what I liked.

‚Ä¢ What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?

I have always thought of the future, setting a goal and ""dreaming"" of reaching it.
Sometimes I imagine future scenarios and I think about how to act in those cases.
I could enjoy the moment when I‚Äôm in company, but I prefer to think of the future rather than the past.
Especially now. 
As a child I already thought that I wanted to become a doctor and at secondary school I had already decided to start the Scientific High School to have a good foundation for the University.
After a short internship I realized that I didn't really want it, but I preferred to be in a higher position and I decided to study Economics.

‚Ä¢ How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?

It depends what they ask me and if I'm busy doing anything else.
I could be ready to help or it could irritate me. 

‚Ä¢ Do you need logical consistency in your life?

Yes I rely on facts, I‚Äôm stubborn and skeptical and I don‚Äôt change my mind if I am not given a good reason to do so.

‚Ä¢ How important is efficiency and productivity to you?

When I want something I inform myself and try to have it as soon as possible.
I hate wasting time and it could irritate me if I slow down especially if one thing interests me.
But I always procrastinated when it came to studying.
Until secondary school I was a good student, but then I started procrastinating. 

‚Ä¢ Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?

It depends.
If we have to do something I want it done in a certain way.
I could let them do or give them directions, but it irritates me to know if they don't.

‚Ä¢ What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?

Sports and gym.
I played soccer, but it hasn't been a passion since childhood like many I know.  I started at age 13 and dreamed of becoming a footballer, but when I realized that it wouldn't happen, I immediately abandoned.
I started gym inspired by Bruce Lee, I started doing research on his training and I followed him for a year, then I decided for a more muscular physique and I did other research and I wrote my own workout.
I don't like it when I'm not training and I thought this was a passion, but I realized that it's more a means to reach my goal.

‚Ä¢ What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?

It depends on the subject.
For Sciences, Literature, History and Philosophy I prefer to read and then be able to express myself, while for Mathematics I prefer concrete examples.
I don't like to memorize, I want to understand ‚Äúwhat‚Äù and ‚Äúwhy‚Äù and I don‚Äôt like to study just because it‚Äôs imposed. 

‚Ä¢ How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?

I like to think of a strategy, even in football I played that way and told others what to do: a kind of player-coach.
I also really liked Risiko, a board game based on the military conquest of the territories.  Even in the gym I follow a workout in a precise manner and it is designed to do the result I want.  At school I like it less, but I try to organize myself.
I don't really like improvising and I prefer to have an initial idea or base to start with.
I could be able based on the situation, but I often get irritated when something goes wrong.

‚Ä¢ What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?

As a child I wanted to be a doctor and already from secondary school I decided to study Scientific High School and then Medicine.  I don't know why, I liked science and studying the human body and maybe I also liked the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãbeing able to treat people.  During adolescence with a passion for football I started thinking about becoming a footballer, but when I realized that it was not possible I left.  At 18 years after a brief internship in hospital I decided to leave because I realized that it was not for me, but I preferred a different place where I could organize and coordinate others and have a more important role at managerial level, Aldo inspired by figures like Steve Jobs, and now I‚Äôm studying Business.

‚Ä¢ What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?

Being useless, not exploiting my potential and failing my goals.

‚Ä¢ What do the ""highs"" in your life look like?

I wouldn't know exactly.
When I get what I want, when I reach a result even if just reached it becomes ""insignificant"" and i think I want more, when I play soccer and when I go out with friends.

‚Ä¢ What do the ""lows"" in your life look like?

When I want something but I can't get it or when I fail in somenthing I really want. 


‚Ä¢ How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?

Sometimes I imagine the future, what could happen, I think about my goals and imagine what it would be like to reach them.
Or I just think about what could happen and think about what I could do.

‚Ä¢Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?

I don't know and it's not something I‚Äôm interested in thinking about.

‚Ä¢ How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?

I like to inform myself, learn about the various alternatives and come to a conclusion.
If it‚Äôs a very important decision I could think about it for a while, but I would like to come to a conclusion right away.
The same thing happens when others are thinking: I am impatient and I want to get to the end.
When I make a decision I‚Äôm quite determined and stubborn even at the cost of making a mistake.

‚Ä¢ How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?

Difficult subject, I wouldn't know what to say and I rarely stop to think about it.  During a relationship it‚Äôs difficult for me to express emotionally, perhaps I tend to impose a logic while trying to express myself.
I could become attached to someone, but losing it never caused me any major problems.
I have always been reserved about it and rarely talk about it. 

‚Ä¢ Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?

I was told that I‚Äôm very stubborn and that I always want to be right and often I also lost my temper and I was prone to anger. 
Sometimes I almost don't realize it, for me it's normal to do so.
A few times I decided to bite my tongue to avoid arguing: in those cases I preferred silence or I left.

‚Ä¢ Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?

I follow the rules, but I'm ready to break them if I find them stupid or if I want to obtain something.
I respect authorities, but at the same time they must earn this respect.",1560861049

ESFP,"I‚Äôm an ISFJ. I like him as a friend, though I have always been attracted to him but never thought he felt the same way. In my opinion, I think he thinks of me as a sister. 

Here are the issues:
1. He‚Äôs moving to a different state for college.
2. I have a strong relationship with his family and don‚Äôt want to ruin it.
3. I don‚Äôt think he likes me like that. In the chance he does, I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôd want a relationship due to point #1. 

I‚Äôm pretty sure he thinks of me as a friend, he talks to me like a sister. We don‚Äôt talk daily or anything like that, or hang out alone unless he‚Äôs driving me somewhere. He definitely cares about me though, he‚Äôs always been there for me and speaks up for me when I‚Äôm too nervous to. When I hadn‚Äôt seen him in a few months, he said he really missed me and even told his parents that. And the other day, he told me to give him a hug for the first time ever, but then it was super awkward because he didn‚Äôt hug back (although I did it super quickly). 

So I‚Äôm pretty sure he thinks of me as a sister, since we never hang out alone and don‚Äôt talk except for only occasionally. We have had a few awkward moments recently like the one above, but other that that nothing.

ESFP,"Me: I just wanna be the most hyper and edgy kid amongs everybody.. tbh i am just another attention seeker. I am nothing but a person with high ego, and low self-esteem. In real life I wouldn't be as confident to act like i do online.. I guess that's a good thing from keeping me out of trouble. But the drive is still there, my desire to be noticed by people is far from gone. I've acted hyper irl several times, and it never ended well. I got ignored, ridiculed, persecuted, bullied, and even confronted for what they call as misbehaviour. I might not be an INTP, but i just can't help but notice how the INTP chat is much more loose and tolerating towards people like me. I want something to be proud of, yet lack the ambition to get it. So i started dwelling on my internal side, trying to convince myself that i have something to be proud of, like a high iq. I also seek much more things from the material world than most intps, and i also like physical affection a lot more than verbal affection.. i might just be an esfp, i guess from now on i'll adjust myself from being a hyper edgy androgynous nerd into something society itself is familiar with. As much as i want to stand out, life for me won't be as smooth sailing if i don't be a normie.. 

I've been bullied by the smart kids at high school for being too 'shallow and tacky'.. I just wanna be noticed and admired

I live in a third world, developing country where first world countries like the United States is most admired by people.I then faked being an american by doing stupid stuffs like speaking english on a daily basis, scrolling through us political pages on Instagram, or scrolling through Yahoo News just to get noticed by my classmates for how 'American' i am compared to them. I have really little interest on actually reading and understanding the news, but much more on 'what others might perceive me as'. Although I know deep down that my classmates aren't really interested nor impressed by my things, i just can't help but to satisfy my desire... And in the process i feel a bit uncomfortable and a bit embarrassed because i know that my classmates would just perceive me as 'someone dumb who wants to get noticed for being out there'

I am used on 'American' things now
For example, I have zero interest on keeping up with news of my country's, because i consider most of them to be barbaric and uncivilized in nature, too chaotic and close minded etc... So i am a bit behind when it comes to what's currently happening in my own country.. People call me ""unpatriotic' and 'picky' for that

I guess im a sensor knowing im the type of person to choose a car solely based on it's look

For a sensor who loves physical affection and material things, i surely am not intrigued by my 'close surrounding'.. it's true that i basically underestimate anything 'local'",1557797748

I know there is something im doing wrong, but i can't figure what exactly. Its not like I can force anyone to like me so I accept it but this shit is way too depressing.  How can I figure out whats wrong?",1557027844

ESFP,"Hi guys! 18F Enfj here! 

I'm wondering if you could help me with some insight on an ESFP guy friend of mine! So, here's the situation: 
We met at the beginning of this semester in college and he was actually the one to initiate that we hangout sometime (he did this 2x, actually) after meeting for the first time and chatting a bit. He embodies the ESFP so acutely: He is charming, talented (he taught himself to play the piano and he does so splendidly!), he is adventurous, spontaneous, good at reading people, an intellectual, etc. 
So over a period of 3-5 weeks, we got really close. He was inspired to to take a year off college to do some traveling around the U.S. and ultimately go to France to learn more about the culture/language/people. 
I had my suspicions that he liked me more as a friend, but he has also had some petty high school drama with girls so that's why he hasn't taken much interest in them in college. He actually called me his only girl friend here at college. Here are some other signs I thought he liked me (and please let me know if I'm reading these correctly): 
‚Ä¢ He compliments me quite a lot, saying that I'm an influencer and that I'm going to do big things, change the world, I'm a good dancer, have a way with words, good poet, good fashion sense, good at reading people (psychoanalysis is sorta what we do A LOT), etc.
‚Ä¢ He says I help him be better and since meeting him, I've seen him mature more as we talk and I express things that may be rude or irritating to others and he takes it to heart and works almost immediately to check himself 
- For ex. He would ask me a question but never let me say, in full, my thoughts. So I expressed to him in a tactful way how that was rude and frustrating and he became very conscience of this since then and let's me say my piece.
‚Ä¢ He says he never gives hugs but he knows how much of a hugger I am so he made an exception 
‚Ä¢ I was going through some tough times with other friends and I think he tried to console me the best way he could: 
- hearing me out
- giving me the objectivity/sound advice I needed with my emotions being askew
- offering me whiskey (imma whiskey kinda gal, what can I say? üòå) 
- he was actually saving the whiskey for the boys, but gave me another glass because he felt bad and apparently I looked like I needed it
- he talks to me about whatever is on his mind, whether it be the latest idea he has, his family, his upcoming trip to France, etc.
- he seems to trust me enough to want my opinion on things, whether it be on clothes (he actually had me go to the mall with him to pick out a wardrobe) or my thoughts on people
- he actually let me pick out his outfits for the day a couple times
* I could say more, but you get the picture
Anyways, so I tell him how I feel about him in two forms: a long message and a poem (which really showed the hopeless romantic in me) 
I'm quite nervous I might've scared him off because he's been more distant with me (we actually haven't hung out since my confession). We have texted but his are always brief so I match his style when texting back. He basically told me that I was a good poet and that he's not looking for anything right now, which is fair. I just can't help but wonder if he doesn't want to initiate something given his past drama with girls (though he has admitted that I'm a ""smart"" one and mature)? I also wonder if it has something to do with him leaving next month? 
He's just demonstrated in so many ways that I'm unique to him or at the very least, he cares for me. He wishes to just stay good friends but he's the one making it awkward. 
To demonstrate that I'm cool with his decision, I asked to hang out along with some other messages and he replied to all of them (in short, concise messages, of course) but that one. I also made sure to add that I wasn't expecting for us to be a couple or anything with titles. I just wanted to continue on the trajectory of our friendship by doing what we always do: talk, listen to music, go on spontaneous trips/walks. I acknowledged that I wanted to be closer to him, but only of he wanted it too. I told him time and time again that I have no intention of keeping him from setting off on his journey and that I am, indeed, happy and excited for him.
In my poem, I asked him in several ways to please not do what he's doing now: not letting me know what's on his mind or how he truly feels. I feel he's being very objective, kinda cold, but still composed and cool in demeanor like he usually is. Has he caught feels for me and is freaking out about it? Or am I just delusional and overthinking it? 
Any advice is helpful. I know I'm asking a lot. 

TL,DR: I, a female ENFJ, told my good guy friend who is an ESFP that I had feelings for him and now he's being distant. We hung out all the time but now our communication has been reduced to brief concise texts. I'm not making it weird, but he sure is. He said he just wanted to be friends and I respect that, but I cannot help but think he's probably scared. For a guy that's never at a loss for words and gives frequent monologues, he's awfully closed in sharing his thoughts with me on this whole situation. Though he has expressed in many ways that I am a pretty awesome girl, he hasn't told me how he feels about me aside from just wanting to be friends and that he's not looking for anything right now. 

- Sorry! That was longer than I anticipated üòÖ",1556175788

2. Do ESFP forget their children too if they live too much in present. How they treat children?

&amp;#x200B;

 ***ESFP Strengths***

**ESFPs** are naturally friendly, outgoing, exciting, and flexible. **ESFPs** always try to make the most of each day, and enjoy doing new and exciting things.

&amp;#x200B;

 ***ESFP Weaknesses***

Because they enjoy living in the present moment, **ESFPs** can often have difficulty planning for the future. They may find themselves getting so caught up in the excitement of their day-to-day lives that they forget their long-term responsibilities.

**ESFPs** are constantly seeking out excitement, but if they are unable to find it, they get bored very easily. This may lead to irresponsible choices and risky behavior. This tendency may also cause problems in romantic relationships ‚Äî **ESFPs** may be afraid of commitment because they are afraid of being trapped in an old, boring relationship. There is nothing **ESFPs** are more afraid of than losing that ‚Äú*spark*‚Äù in their relationship.

**ESFPs** love for aesthetic beauty and poor planning skills may result in irresponsible financial choices. **ESFPs** may find themselves focusing on the short-term benefits of their purchases, rather than the long term consequences. It may be challenging for **ESFPs** to set budgets in general, and they may be frivolous or materialistic.

**ESFPs** often seek out the opinions of others, but may have a hard time accepting criticism. They may become reliant on others‚Äô approval to validate their self-worth. Others may view **ESFPs** as overly-sensitive and emotional.

&amp;#x200B;

 ***ESFP Parenthood***

**ESFPs** are very fun-loving parents. They are constantly looking for fun and exciting activities to do with their children.

When their children try and fail, **ESFP** parents are always there to help pick their child back up, encouraging them to try again.

**ESFPs** certainly do have rules, but may have a hard time enforcing them. **ESFP** parents do not like feeling as if they are strict authoritarians. In addition, **ESFPs** do not like conflict and are especially hurt when their children are disrespectful. It is important for **ESFP** parents to remind themselves that sometimes you need to enforce the rules ‚Äì the rules are there to help and protect your child!

&amp;#x200B;

 ***ESFP Romantic Relationships***

**ESFPs** are free-spirited and fun, an energy they naturally bring into their romantic relationships. **ESFPs** do not want to slowly get to know someone, they want to skip ahead and experience all the excitement that life has to offer! They are constantly looking for new and exciting date ideas and getaways with their romantic partners.

Because **ESFPs** are constantly seeking out excitement, they may have a difficult time committing and staying in a long-term relationship. **ESFPs** dread falling into a boring routine, so anyone dating an **ESFP** must keep things exciting and fresh.

&amp;#x200B;

 ***ESFP Friendships***

**ESFPs** make very loyal and kind friends. They are always there for a friend in need. At other times, however, they will make sure that everyone is having a great time! You will never have a boring evening with an **ESFP**.

Many people are naturally drawn to the charismatic and friendly nature of **ESFPs**. In turn, **ESFPs** are accepting of all others, even those who have very different personality types than themselves. They often make great friends for introverts, who don‚Äôt mind sharing the spotlight.

&amp;#x200B;

 ***ESFP Work Habits***

**ESFPs** are very giving and are willing to help others when needed, and this is apparent in the workplace. **ESFPs** are great team-players. They enjoy working in groups, and are both flexible and practical when doing so. **ESFPs** are often described as hardworking and willing to help.

While **ESFPs** can get along with most people, people who enjoy a great deal of structure and routine may find it difficult to work with **ESFPs**. They may view **ESFPs** as too free-spirited and irresponsible, and will quickly get frustrated.

People with this personality type have trouble dealing with conflict, and will to go great lengths to avoid conflict. Although they may seek affirmation from others, they are very sensitive to any negative feedback.

&amp;#x200B;

 ***ESFP Career Paths***

**ESFPs** thrive in careers that allow them to be creative and interact with others. They often are well-suited for careers as artists, actors, sales representatives, social workers, designers, consultants, or photographers.

ESFP,"I recently found out that I'm not an ESFP or ENFP, as long as I thought I had dominant Se justifying it as ""taking things as it is,"" it also came with a whole other set of traits that I don't relate to in the slightest, including things like [being assertive, concerned with aesthetics, and great at taking charge,](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/ay3hgu/comment/ehxz14q), and this kind of thing has been popping up [everywhere,](https://www.reddit.com/r/ESFP/comments/aygosi/comment/eijn8ru) and has been [following me around for as long as I can remember.](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/b6qz91/comment/ejp8q8e) You can clearly see me trying to overlook these for a long time, but after awhile it starts to feel like I'm forcing a puzzle piece. It came down to, if I'm not an ESFP, then I'm not an ESFP. 

After being lowkey rejected by ESFPs, I figured I was ENFP, especially with [posts like this,](http://imgur.com/e1BDWDZ) and [posts like this,](http://imgur.com/Pu6LNeO) and [posts like this,](http://imgur.com/gpeyCZI) lmao. But then I go and read about [dominant Ne](https://mbti-notes.tumblr.com/post/120104389987/how-functions-work-dominant-ne-entpenfp) and [intuition in general...](https://www.google.com/amp/s/funkymbtifiction.tumblr.com/post/156783898500/types-and-intuition/amp)

[... it sends my running for my dear S.](https://youtu.be/KjDtm-l2FSI)

My cognition simply isn't dominant Ne. I'm not constantly [shooting out ideas ](https://www.careerplanner.com/8CognitiveFunctions/Extraverted-Intuiting.cfm) or [having hunches while drowning in possibilities,](https://www.google.com/amp/s/funkymbtifiction.tumblr.com/post/175761323775/the-trials-and-tribulations-of-a-ne-dom/amp)

[Where are y'all seeing the intuition?? LMAO](https://youtu.be/KKBLmMB70DA)

So I found a good middle ground at ESFJ - And to confirm it, I was verified over a video chat and got typed as an *obvious* ESFJ, and  ESFJ pretty much accounts for everything. My massive Si tendincies I'm always talking about, the resteraunt stuff and the nostalgic recalling dates from the past, and I tend to base my descisions off the past too, like if I knew that this particular resteraunt has some nasty broken soda mechine, I won't order soda there, things like that. ESFJ also has Ne, just not dominant, but it's there enough to explain why I kept getting barraged with ENFP typings lol. And the inferior Ti would explain why I'm pretty bad at logical consistency, people have pointed that out to me a lot too. 

**But about the Fe.** People have pointed out that in my questionnaires I mention appreciating a good social atomosphere, that's lively, cheerful and accepting, and accepts me for who I am, and it sounds very Fe. Wanting to interact with people especially on discord, caring about twitter followers, wanting to be chill and not control anybody - sounds like Fe. 

But the thing I don't relate to, is Fe being good at creating social circles, reading the room, being good with social cues, and being well liked by most. I am a cringelord for crying out loud, ever since elementary school I've been kind of lowkey outcasted, because I'd always overdo it with expressing my obsessions or meme references or whatever. My family also gets on my ass a LOT about acting socially inappropriate, and I've actually been banned from some places. I'm trying to work on that, but my point is it doesn't come *naturally,* like a dominant function should. I'm far from a popular social butterfly, the closest thing I'll be to that is typology discord lmao. I believe that everyone has the right to live their life their own way, we're not here to control each other, nobody is less than as a human, the world (especially cities haha) is a beautiful place, and I see no need for social games, gaslighting or any form of malicious manipulation, I just want to live my life with people I love and do what I love. Does this support or go against Fe? They seem to be very big traits, just like how Se dom have these big traits, and I would just like to know if it's that big of a deal to worry about, or if they actually end up supporting my type.

I‚Äôm going to be a floor advisor next year and I‚Äôll only be 20 so if I go out I‚Äôll lose my job and free room, and I‚Äôm also graduating so I won‚Äôt have another chance to go out on st Patrick‚Äôs day. I haven‚Äôt gone out on saint Patrick‚Äôs day before and I really really want to experience it and this years my only chance. Now in addition to that there‚Äôs a rave next Friday that I‚Äôve been planning on going to for literally a year. The problem is the shows also on that Friday and the other props assistant is completely incompetent and I don‚Äôt want to leave all of the responsibility on the props master who is also one of my close friends. 

I made these commitments and even though I didn‚Äôt realize how much it was going to be, I should really stick to it.  But I‚Äôm also doing this purely for extra curricular, and everyone else there is theater majors/minors and getting class credit for all of this. Skipping out for parties would be selfish and the entire theater department would be pissed at me. However if I skip out on the parties my other friends will be pissed at me, I‚Äôll be out the $30 for my rave ticket,and I‚Äôm really going to regret missing them. I live for these sort of life experiences and they make up a lot of my favorite memories. 

No matter what I do, I‚Äôm going to feel guilty and a lot of my friends are going to be upset. I figure that means I might as well do what I want to go and actually enjoy myself, but that would also make me a bad/selfish person. I‚Äôm young and want to embrace the chance to be irresponsible and have fun while I still can. I don‚Äôt know what to do :( 

TLDR:  I made a commitment that‚Äôs way more time and energy than I expected and means I have to cancel plans for two days that I‚Äôve been planning for a very long time and really looking forward to. I don‚Äôt want to be selfish, but canceling my plans also doesn‚Äôt seem worth it. I‚Äôm torn between enjoying myself and being a good person. 

ALSO I KNOW THIS IS A REALLY DUMB PREDICAMENT but all of my friends are so stressed about it that it‚Äôs making me really stressed. ",1552523773

I really enjoy talking to people, but I also don't mind being alone if they don't enjoy talking to me. Memes, discord, reddit, etc are still fun. My social life could be more active, but everybody expects you to put on some kind of persona or else you'll be socially outcasted. Online, you can socialize just fine and not have to deal with all that garbage.

ESFPs tend to be stereotyped as being the class clown or like the pop star, but there are other less flashy, notable ESFPs who just know how to work a room. The politicians like Bill Clinton or Chris Christie are two examples.

I have been conducting interviews for many years (MBTI related) and this is just an extension of that, however, I want to discuss topics that the audience wants me to cover. Naturally, I'll come up with my own material but I would love to explore topics that others have in mind.

We do live far from each other ( around halfway across the world ) but I guess our bond is special or used to be. Since a few months she has been different, I noticed a pattern that there is one day everyweek when she will just ignore me ? Like I can spot that she is online elsewhere but will leave me on seen. Happened on Sunday but on Saturday she was like ‚ÄúLove you Chloek07‚Äù etc etc, I don‚Äôt get this inconsistent behaviour. I do understand she has other friends. She is modestly popular. I have told her if she can‚Äôt talk, then she can just let me know. But she never listens. Lately she has been dating a lot as well, it all started around the same time. She started going out more, I am a bit worried right now because there has been this change in her behaviour. She is out on dates every week, which is fine but it‚Äôs been a bit sudden. This and the inconsistent behaviour has me a bit worried. Also, she sometimes dodges my questions, I will ask her something and she won‚Äôt even reply to me. Just ignore my question.

ESFP,"The stereotype that we are all shallow people with zero inhibitions and care for others, makes me so mad. In person we're  likeable but on the internet (especially myerbriggs forums) we get torn apart and called all types of names. Players, party animals, flakey, all types of things that act as though we're a two dimensional character in some shitty book who lacks inner dialogue and actual feelings.

Of course I don't mean everyone, but do you feel like people think we're ""shallow"" because we dont wallow constantly on what is worrying and plaguing us? What constitutes someone as deep? Do you have to be someone who constantly talks about how you think life is meaningless, or what happens after death?? Do we have to make every conversation forcefully heavy and uncomfortable?? Maybe instead of spilling all our private and deepest thoughts to everyone, we like to keep it to ourselves!!! and only reveal it to the people we trust the most!!!!!! instead of laying all this shit on everyone else!!

Maybe the reason why we seem so fucking stupid and flighty is because we're torn between not wanting anyone to truly know us, to wanting to be understood and loved!!! maybe we're afraid of being truly known. maybe we're afraid of being hurt. why does everyone reduce us to something so surface level and shallow? 

I don't know, this is a stupid rant but it just hurts to think some people think we dont have any actual feelings, thoughts or depth. Because we definitely do. I know it. Sure we enjoy life's physical pleasures but it doesn't mean our heads are filled with sand! just because we dont spew all the things we feel out to everyone, doesn't mean we dont feel.

I'm tired of this stereotype. Like everyone, I want to be loved and understood. Not everyone can give you that though, so of course I'm not going to open up to everyone. I'm going to stay surface level with people who I believe don't connect with me on that level.

ESFP," I'm not sure why I have the urge to share this, but I just feel impulsive...forgive me ;) 

 I only know one ESFP for sure, and only because I forced him to take the Myers Briggs on a long road trip. That person is my dad! :)

 If I'm judging ESFPs based off of my dad's personality, I'd like to say that you guys really are awesome people!

 My dad is funny, spontaneous, brave, charismatic, loyal, forgetful, kindhearted, and always does what he feels is right. He can have a great conversation with anyone about anything (which I admire greatly, since I'm shit at small-talk.)

 My mom is ISTP. They've been together for 21 years and they still love each other. Definitely some communication problems! But they laugh when they both come home with a gallon of milk without knowing the other was buying milk (they've done this hundreds of times over the years and not just with milk.)

 My dad loves to go on drives to places he's never been, loves to play pranks, loves the new and exciting, loves a good joke, and loves his family. I love that about my dad. He's really a big sweetheart with a million stories. If someone doesn't like my dad, then I seriously question their judgment....but I might be biased (I'm totally not.) 



Tldr: From the daughter of an ESFP, thanks for being you! I'm glad you're out there in the world making life memorable for the ones you're close to. Continue being great and know you're appreciated!",1544619124

ESFP,"So, I don't know for sure, but he kind of fits the bill for it and I'm trying to gauge the best way to deal with our impending divorce.   


I'm an ENTJ woman; I've always been the bread winner, always been the one with high expectations, driven, pushing him to be better, helping him with college, the military (I got him enlisted because it helped me), etc. I'm pretty sure the pushing finally got to a point where he couldn't take it anymore and we both just started losing respect for one another and couldn't communicate anymore due to him always taking everything I said as criticism and it was to the point that I used the same tactic I usually do with discuss of divorce and told him to leave and he finally did. He had enough. He's done.   


I didn't realize he was really done though, so within a few days I'm trying to talk to him like we're just fighting per the usual, got us in counseling, we had some fights, and then 17 days after leaving, he was sleeping with someone else. Loyalty is a big deal for ENTJ's so this caused me to flip and go on the extreme aggressive side of things which included some vengeance, upping the ante, and of course none of that helped. But why - you ask - would I even want to bother with someone who is dead set on being done? Because we have kids. And part of what made me flip so hard besides the loyalty is that he wasn't really invested in seeing them during that time because he's too caught up in living in the moment.   


Well, that girl lasted from Oct 17th to roughly Nov 11 and the last I heard they saw each other was Nov 26. By Nov 28th, he met a new girl and he's only known her for all of 10 days but things seem to be going well there and he's been staying over there frequently. During this time, he has only seen the kids 6 times (Mainly in Oct) and that's on both of us (I got petty on some stuff and he decided to concede everything to letting a court handle the situation).   


I don't know if this is normal behavior for a ESFP type person but I do know he has a habit of basically hopping into a new relationship very fast to get over an old one and has a unique ability to just drop people when he wants. So I'm curious if this behavior fits the mold or if it's a different personality type. He's got great charm, charisma, likes to be the center of attention and is constantly changing his appearance to fit whatever job he's in (currently he's becoming more of a country guy and his new dig is quite country herself).   


And if he is ESFP - what is the best way for someone with a more aggressive personality type to find common ground? We both currently have an issue with trust, but I need to re-establish at least some basic level of trust in order to work towards co-parenting with him.   


We have a custody hearing on Thursday and until tonight, he and I hadn't spoken or seen each other in a month, but I'm the pushy type so I sought him out. With all the deep diving I've been doing into my own personality type, we were able to have a much needed civil discussion of my expectations that his ""living in the moment"" doesn't affect our children and that he doesn't let the flings ever take priority over them. He seemed to agree, assured me he could ""drop them"" if it ever became an issue, but was reserved to admit his habits of going out and partying all the time because he likely feels like it's something I'd jump on and criticize. Which I likely would because he also complains of not having money when he just bought a 2018 car and is funding the attorney since he's the one who filed for divorce.   


Either way - I just want to find the best way to move forward and understand him better so that I'm not causing the same waves I did with our previous relationship.

ESFP,"Hi, 20 yr old ISFP here. Guy is 22 yr old ESFP. (Long post and a little nsfw, sorry!)

 I‚Äôve known this esfp since may 2017. We met on Tinder. We were purely platonic friends for 2 months (he knew my past experiences with guy friends and sex were not good, so he said we didn‚Äôt have to have sex) before *I* was the one who admitted I wanted to have sex with him. He agreed to it. Best sex ever, each and every time since then. Sexual chemistry was crazy. 

Outside of sex, we just hunt out, talked about our current lives, went out to eat sometimes. When things were clearly getting rough for him, I told him that if he ever needed to talk to me, I‚Äôd be there for him. (That ISFP loyalty y‚Äôall.) He seemed to appreciate this.

By Christmas 2017 I developed mild feelings for him and gave him a small present. He was so grateful he almost cried, wouldn‚Äôt stop hugging and thanking me. I told him it wasn‚Äôt a big deal (because I didn‚Äôt want to get my hopes up) but he insisted it was a huge deal to him. He started kissing me and I was hesitant. But I fell for him, and we had romantic sex. After that I was 90% sure that he liked me. 

Then I confessed to him on Instagram and was rejected, in somewhat of a douchey way. He said I was just sort of boring. Ouch. I blocked him on IG hoping to never speak to him again.

He hit me up via text during summer 2018 (I forgot I gave him my number) asking me where I went and that he wanted to see me again. I frustratedly replied that HE was the one who said I was boring. He apologized and said he was depressed over a different girl at the time and took it out on me. 

When I saw him, and asked me if he wanted to tell me anything, he smiled huge and said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, it‚Äôs just really nice seeing you again.‚Äù

At that point I didn‚Äôt even really care how he felt about me, nor whether or not he was lying. I just wanted to sleep with him again. Every time we did it, he was SO good, always going the extra mile, and telling me ‚ÄúGod you‚Äôre so hot‚Äù, ‚ÄúYou just look so good, I wanna go again‚Äù, etc so I knew for a fact he‚Äôs attracted to me. We‚Äôd fuck like bunnies. So we just kept doing that until a few weeks ago.

I was afraid where this was going and didn‚Äôt trust him so I put a halt to the sex. I told him if he wants to keep hanging out with me as a friend that he can, but if he doesn‚Äôt want to then I‚Äôd understand. He said he‚Äôd miss the sex but would be down for seeing me as friends, and would make plans with me soon.

...I honestly didn‚Äôt expect a message from him after that. 

After 2 weeks since we last met, he messaged me today asking me if I saw this movie, and I said no. He asked me if I wanted to see it with him, and asked if he could come over tomorrow. (He actually wanted to see me today, but I declined because it was too sudden.) I said sure, but reminded him that I‚Äôd just moved and there‚Äôs still literally nothing to do at my apartment. He said he loves my apartment just the way it is, and said ‚Äúnot to worry‚Äù since he will bring multiplayer games. And yes, he was really nice about it. 

I‚Äôm just so confused. So he wants to hang. But didn‚Äôt he say I was too boring?? Does he feels bad or something ? Or is this a ploy to fuck ? What is going on through his head ??

P.S. I‚Äôm not expecting anything good to come out of this. I‚Äôm seeing a different guy later this week who I‚Äôve been crushing on for a while now. I just want some answers about this one. As an ISFP I‚Äôm always on the edge of making some cold decisions to protect myself but maybe his intentions are actually good. Help please. ",1543851638

ESFP,"*You didn't close the door*

*Left a crack open*

*I couldn't ignore the faint possibility*

*Of having hope in this insanity*

*. . .*

*But we're stuck floating in between*

*(*[*""Reflections"" by Misterwives*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_zgqlUutvM)*)*

&amp;#x200B;

Awhile back I determined that I was ENFP with the help of a lot of people.. but I feel like there's still a part of ESFP that's nagging at me and I can't help but question things again..

Last night, I had my friend who knew me for a long time read traits from [this](https://www.psychologyjunkie.com/2016/12/22/se-user-ne-user-difference-extraverted-sensing-extraverted-intuition/) Se vs Ne description (I copy and pasted the traits into a text document instead of handing them the raw article because they'll either be confused and/or biased if they read the words ""Extraverted sensor/intuition"" attached to the descriptions). I labeled Se DESCRIPTION 1 and Ne DESCRIPTION 2. The things I italicized are what they found apply to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**DESCRIPTION 1**

&amp;#x200B;

*‚Äì Are adaptable and easy-going*

*‚Äì Are realistic and down-to-earth*

*‚Äì Are practical and matter-of-fact*

*‚Äì Are excited by adventure and¬†thrills*

*‚Äì Live ‚Äúin the moment‚Äù and prefer to focus on the here-and-now*

*‚Äì Are fond of concrete facts and are aware of details*

*‚Äì Learn best from hands-on experience*

*‚Äì Seek stimulation by experiencing life in a hands-on, immersive way*

*‚Äì Have a ‚Äúlive and let live‚Äù mentality*

*‚Äì Tend to be impulsive and trust their impulses*

*‚Äì Are fun-loving and optimistic*

*‚Äì Pride themselves on being bold, unconventional, and spontaneous*

*‚Äì Prize freedom*

*‚Äì See all the details around them*

&amp;#x200B;

**DESCRIPTION 2**

‚Äì Are always thinking of possibilities and what ‚Äúcould be‚Äù

‚Äì Focus on the future much more than the present

*‚Äì Are original and independent*

‚Äì Love to start and initiate creative projects, but struggle with completing projects

*‚Äì Work in bursts of impulsive energy*

*‚Äì Hate routine*

‚Äì Seek and trust inspiration and are willing to follow it anywhere.

*‚Äì Tend to be enthusiastic and good with people*

‚Äì Love to inspire and motivate others

*‚Äì Find hidden patterns, possibilities, and potentials*

‚Äì See so many alternatives that they can have trouble focusing on just one thing

‚Äì Are open-minded and slow to form premature conclusions

‚Äì See things in impressions and focus on ‚Äúthe big picture‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

And based on this I was going ....uhhhhh, when did I ever believe I was ENFP lmao?

&amp;#x200B;

Because if we're going by the straight, basic traditional definitions of MBTI sensing/intuition, I don't really fall into the ""big picture focused, future-oriented, abstract"" category of intuition. If we just step back for a second, the [very first description I posted about myself on here](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/94v2ob/type_me_from_the_description_i_wrote_about_myself/), I'm not sure if it embodies what you would call ""stereotypical Ne traits,"" like what I mentioned above. This is a huge reason why I held strong to ESFP for 7 months, I am simply not intuitive under these terms and S/N was the absolute last letter I would've thought would change if I was mistyped.

&amp;#x200B;

But then we dig deeper into the functions. The Se traits of essentially taking things as they are and not really looking for a deeper meaning, just wanting to enjoy life and caring more about the present are about the extent of what I relate to. But the rest? It doesn't add up. Being adept with the environment, good at quickly taking action, good at and often asserts themselves socially, physically, wants material things to be happy, going out of their way to try new things, etc. Those may manifest in different ways and that's how stereotypes like partying, sports, skydiving etc are created. But the underlying motivation, which is what I'm trying my best to look at instead of the airhead stereotype behavior, does not add up.

[http://possibilitywarrior.com/the-tao-of-type/se-extraverted-sensing/](http://possibilitywarrior.com/the-tao-of-type/se-extraverted-sensing/)

&amp;#x200B;

These are just a few examples, but do you see that similar kind of trend? And that happens with almost all of the Se descriptions I come by, and even when people are talking about Se in the most non-stereotypical way they can I still can't relate.. The whole aura, assertive sort of ""hyped up"" nature of Se doms don't really fit me and I find that the less forceful but more like enthusiastic and excited, hyped up but in a more passive and fan-girlish way nature of ENFPs fit me infinitely more.

&amp;#x200B;

Plus, based on what I relate to for Si a lot of people agree that this rules out Se dom.

&gt;I have a tendency to order the same thing from restaurants, every single time, because I know it‚Äôs good and I don‚Äôt want to like ‚Äòwaste my trip‚Äô on something I might not like. I prefer comfort/stability over constantly trying new things.  Someone once asked me what my biggest problem in my life is. I answered this:  ‚ÄúI think the biggest issue in my life is not being able to really let go to certain things. I can‚Äôt let go of this certain part of my past, this certain group that the universe seems to be going out of its way to keep me away from them, and things that I‚Äôve gotten obsessed with, no matter how much it‚Äôs affecting my life there are certain things I just can‚Äôt let go.‚Äù  I am the most nostalgic person in my friend group by FAR. I have over 80,000 photos in my camera roll with countless memories and experiences I wish to cherish forever, and I refuse to delete ANY OF THEM. And if it‚Äôs an event that was especially important to me, I can easily tell you that we ate at McDonalds at this seat, I got bitten by fire ants on my right ankle, my friend X was there with a Samsung phone, all those details are crystal clear to me. I‚Äôm constantly going ‚ÄúOne year ago on this day X emotionally significant event happened‚Äù to my friends, I‚Äôve been doing it less lately because I realized that no one cares.. but no I don‚Äôt have a problem with memory at all. If anything it‚Äôs pretty good as long as I‚Äôm talking about something I care about. I also have a whole playlist full of nostalgic songs that take me back to the good old days, and I love listening to that sometimes.--  When I‚Äôm deeply involved in something, I find it really hard to take breaks to eat, shower etc. I know gross. I do get to it of course but once I‚Äôm doing something I don‚Äôt want to do anything else. Once I was walking downtown with my friends and because of my crippling FOMO I was holding in my need to use the bathroom for 5 hours and it eventually got so bad that I just had to haul butt over there. I feel pretty dumb sometimes because of that, especially when I get called out for it. ‚ÄúYou forgot to EAT?! How do you forget to eat????‚Äù And I can‚Äôt even give a reasonable explanation for it.  I don‚Äôt really have a problem losing stuff because I just shove everything in the same purse all the time.. but when it does happen, holy crap it is a mess. I throw everything out onto the floor and it‚Äôs just absolute chaos until I can find it. But thankfully that doesn‚Äôt happen too often.

&amp;#x200B;

Believe me, I have been trying for 7 months to hang onto ESFP and support it using only the basic things of Se I can relate to. But literally everything else does not add up. On the other hand, I find myself clicking and relating to more ENFPs than ESFPs, by fictional characters, internet, real life. After I started being more honest with my self description and included everything and not just the Se sounding parts, according to [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-P3cKWkEkgyWe4VsHQiQ_wwPCiAxZGqrUsFMZILyxbE/edit) the majority seem to agree that I don't have Se at all let alone dominant Se, and I'm more likely to be ENFP. After I thought about it, I realized that the Si, Fi, Extravert, and general nature just simply *fits* me all the way, and I don't feel like I have to write a certain way, only post certain traits, or twist crap around to relate to ENFPs, it just automatically *clicks* and just simply being myself is enough proof. My profile has a lot of evidence for this. I just simply don't relate to the intuitive part.

This is where I'm having trouble at this point, I'm not sure if the reasons for thinking ESFP outweigh my the reasons for thinking ENFP or vice versa.. I feel like they are both equally compelling arguments and both are just as likely and I don't know where to go.. I'd like to hear your thoughts on this",1543770029

ESFP,"Years ago when I was less confident about myself and had more self doubts, my personality was more leaning towards ISFP. But I started hanging out and became more extroverted to the point where I get energised from people rather than recharging alone. Now that I mature more, I would say I am both. More ISFP in relationships and a mixture of both when it comes to friendships Does anyone else here feel like they encompass the traits of both personality or transit from one to the other at different points of their lives? ",1541581941
ESFP,"I‚Äôm fairly certain that I have Fi, but unsure if it‚Äôs dominant or auxiliary. I wrote a description of myself awhile back that was based on how others saw me, traits I saw in myself, and tried to cover different areas in my life. I got mixed results, a lot of ESFP and INFP. I‚Äôve read about both and I can easily see myself as both, but I know I can only possibly be one, and I‚Äôm stumped trying to find out. 

I‚Äôll make my case for each and try to include my motivations as well.  

**My main reasons for INFP** are the Fi-Si loop: I‚Äòm sentimental and nostalgic about certain events in my past and love sharing them because I‚Äôm not ready to let them go, and I‚Äôd like to think those around me care as much as I do. I have a lot of photos and remember the specific dates of the events that were emotionally relevant for me, again because I don‚Äôt want to forget, I believe that they aren‚Äôt truly gone unless you forget about them. I don‚Äôt care about my appearance as much, I obviously take care of hygiene but I rarely deviate from my normal clothing style because it‚Äôs comfortable, that and because I freaking hate clothes shopping in general haha. I don‚Äôt display a lot of your average Se traits, I‚Äôm pretty clumsy and uncharismatic, and you could see my cringe-worthy and awkward movements from a mile away if you saw me in real life. I‚Äôm not sure if this would be attributed to inferior Te or not, but I‚Äôm pretty un-assertive and I don‚Äôt like taking the lead for random things just for the sake of taking the lead. It‚Äôs not that I dislike the attention, I just hate asserting myself and trying to act as an authority figure. I wouldn‚Äôt like being above people, I‚Äôd rather be equal and liked than higher and powerful, and plus the added responsibility and pressure is not worth it for me. If it‚Äôs something that I‚Äôm truly passionate about though, I‚Äôm absolutely the first to speak up and let everyone know, whether I not I‚Äôd really ‚Äútake the lead‚Äù that depends, but I definitely show a lot of excitement and enthusiasm if something I‚Äôm passionate about hits. 

**My main reasons for ESFP:** I feel like I‚Äôm too trusting and enthusiastic about the company of people to be an INFP. I‚Äôve gotten feedback about being very na√Øve and open to strangers even as a child. Canceled social plans just cut so deep for me, I can‚Äôt even explain the overwhelming disappointment when I‚Äôm looking forward to hanging out and then it just gets rescheduled or cancled. I love being with people, especially when they allow me to be who I am and let me show my real self. I love telling stories, making friends, laughing my ass off, and being well known in the community/social life. I feel absolutely furfilled and hyped after a fun social night and I can‚Äôt relate to needing to immediately go home and be alone to recharge. Whole I don‚Äôt mind my alone time, I usually just use it to watch shows or make memes or something, I rarely ever go deep into my thoughts and get extremely depressed if I do. Life is awesome and I think being existential and over-complicated makes things really depressing and weighed down for no reason. I‚Äôve never really seen myself as intuitive, in fact I‚Äôve even gotten feedback for not thinking about future implications, ‚Äúyou need to look at the big picture,‚Äù think about the long-term etc. I sometimes blurt things out without realizing the consequences and doing absolutely retarded things in the moment and then physically cringing at myself as I look back and reflect on it. It looks like a great idea and it looks like the best option at the time, so I‚Äôd go ahead and then it just blows up in my face. 

Based on my evaluation (and if necessary, my profile shows my previous type me posts), what would you reckon I could be?",1541521995
ESFP,"Any other ESFPs kind of bothered by the stereotypes of our type? Even before knowing what MBTI was, I spent a long time acting like an INJ type because I was tired of being assumed dumb, promiscuous, and shallow-- especially in high school. I'm a 22-year-old female ESFP, blonde (I'm sure that doesn't help with the stereotypes), and am interested in fashion and makeup. I like to look good, I enjoy reality television, and going out dancing. But I'm also interested in deeper issues. I'm extremely shy and struggle with social anxiety. I'm not obnoxious... except maybe sometimes around very close friends. :) I'm studying to be a psychotherapist. I'm interested in philosophy and the ultimate meaning of the world. I'm very existential. I write poetry and am a musician. I've had straight As since elementary school. I enjoy spending my time researching. I can hold intelligent discussions. I connect easily with NT types. All of this to say, these things aren't stereotypical of an ESFP, but they're true regardless.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm finally starting to embrace my actual type, and therefore my actual personality, despite the initial embarrassment and desire to avoid the aforementioned stereotypes. Being an ESFP isn't about (at least in my experience) acting irresponsible and stupid. It's about using the external world to absorb information and then using an internal value system as well as an external reasoning system to sort through that information.

It's unfortunate to see that this Subreddit is so quiet, but it makes sense. Anyways, just wondering if my fellow ESFPs feel this way at all. ",1541172269

ESFP,"I personally think it's mostly a load of bs from a judgemental intuitive lol what are your thoughts?

&gt;Extraverted Sensation Types

Extraverted Sensation is the easiest function to understand as it simply coincides with what we observe in the outer reality, usage of the body, force, where objects are located in life and biological factors as well as observation of societal tradition and ancestry.

This type's thinking and feeling are mostly guided by the objective reality in general. They are the most ordinary in society and live life by the standardized rules and regulations. Depending on the subtype, one's ethics (Se-Fi) or ideaologies (Se-Ti) may keep them from going overboard as far as hedonism goes.

Se dominants with Se subtypes are more hedonistic and have less developed auxiliary functions. (A few rappers belong to this type. Ted Bundy may have also belonged to this type and of course was an extreme case.)

Most MBTI blogs don't mention the portion of Se that observes and celebrates ancestral history. However, Jung, Von Franz &amp; Van der Hoop have brought this up. It is also a huge piece of information because it is why Ni dominants are said to at times worship ancestral figures or believe they are in ""spiritual communication"" with archetypes. (Feeling angels watching over them and etc.)

Se doms are very much interested in biological facts and scientific research based on dissection of plants, animals and etc

Se doms were the majority of western civilization during the time of Jung, Von Franz &amp; Van der Hoop.

[ Inferior Ni ] Se types are often good at writing Science Fiction stories or telling ghost stories for fun. The Sci-Fi movies are mostly based in fantasies that manipulate biology because they are aware they are absurd and have no chance of coming true. (As opposed to the Ni dom who is more likely to believe in things such as ghosts &amp; etc.) Paranormal horror films such as The Grudge, Idle Hands, Pet Semetary&amp; Sci-Fi movies such as Jurassic Park, The Fly and Tarantula are great examples of great extraverted sensing creativity in movies. (This isn't to say they are Se types but Se/Ni has been applied.)

They are the best at knowing how to use force, aggression and the body to reach their goals. This is why they are often said to be amazing athletes.

[ Inferior Ni ] -- During times of stress, they may deviate away from their normal mode of common sense and become paranoid that others are doing things against them

[ Inferior Ni ] -- In stress or considering people they dislike, they made attribute inaccurate intuitions about them

[ Inferior Ni ] -- May suddenly become interested in eastern philosophy , unconventional spirituality or become interested in basic forms of parapsychology such as the ""daily horoscope"" and such. However, they truly don't understand the concepts of such things and leave that to Ni doms.

One of the most efficient and happy-go-lucky types out of them all. They can be happy simply being alive and make the most out of the moment.

They may like a neat and aesthetically pleasing house, dress according to the weather and sometimes like to flex material goods.
[ Unhealthy Se ] -- They may have an intense ego if they are unhealthy and accumulate tons of money. They become flashy, extravagant, shallow, and egotistical. (Some rappers belong to this type.)
[ Unhealthy Se ] -- They may expect special treatment due to status and can be classist. They may set certain standards concerning who's ""allowed"" to be seen with them or not based on morals or ideas surrounding materialism. (The women from the movie Jawbreaker and Mean Girls are included in this type.)

Sometimes Se types confuse themselves with feelers because reflexive emotions are sparked with sensations at times and can be intense. ( A woman may get a sudden intense sensation during sex or a man when seeing a woman he is super attracted to.) However, emotional intensity is mostly caused by perceptive functions instead of evaluative ethics.

As for academics, Im currently on the failing edge in terms of academics, I don‚Äôt know man, maybe I just really don‚Äôt like the course of study I‚Äôm doing right now. But the thing is, if I quit halfway, how would my parents feel about sending loads of money only to fail after that.

ESFP,"Any personality type is probably capable of cheating under the right circumstances, and ESFPs have a reputation for being the flirtiest type, but I feel like they are relatively unlikely to cheat for a few reasons:

1. They would not stay in a relationship that makes them unhappy enough to cheat. They‚Äôre more likely to cut ties first. 
2. They don‚Äôt have the patience it would take to try to cover up their infidelity. This would require a lot of strategic maneuvering/planning that they‚Äôre not interested in. 
3. Because introverted feeling is such a major part of their being, they wouldn‚Äôt be comfortable with the ‚Äúfakery‚Äù that would be infidelity. In other words, they need to be themselves so wholeheartedly that they couldn‚Äôt bring themselves to either stay in an unhappy relationship nor sleep with someone else while being in a relationship. 

Of course, there‚Äôs the possibility that an ESFP‚Äôs impulsivity wins out, and they do actually sleep with someone but soon after regret it and realize how much they love the partner they‚Äôre with. Has anyone ever been in this situation? Some people need to test boundaries and experience something before they can understand it, and I think ESFPs are definitely that type. 

Also, what about sleeping with an ex? It seems like introverted feeling would stop them there as well. Obviously, you broke up for a reason, and introverted feeling tends to like emotional closure to a point where you wouldn‚Äôt have any interest in reopening that door. 

Anyone have any experience with any of this?",1540245533
ESFP,"my brother, an esfp, just had his heart broken by a woman he was deeply in love with. just this weekend he shared with us that he was going to ask her to marry him, and now this happened. i want to do what i can to help him through this, but i'm at a loss of what i can do. he's the only feeler in our family since our dad passed away, as well as the only male. and i know zero about relationships so i can't even give him any helpful advice.

if it was me hurting, i'd want to be left alone to think and process and analyze until i could make sense of what happened and how i feel. but i'm VERY aware that this isn't a method that works for everyone. 

i tried distracting him today with a new video game. we had a nice conversation about playstyles, battle preferences, and ranking franchises by the quality of their combat systems. it seemed to cheer him up, if just for a while. i also spent a few hours today texting him star wars memes. he loves those. even managed to find some he hadn't seen yet.

how am i doing so far? and any advice on what else i can do? i really am at a loss here.

ESFP,"Hey , 

I am an INTJ , I am here to ask your opinion on something. 

My best friend is an female ESFP , we have been really good friends since two years. Our friendship is online , mostly texting everyday , snapchat and sometimes talking over the phone or video chat. She lives far away. I have never let anyone as close to myself as her. She is literally my everything. I was in a bad situation when we met but she has been my closest ally. I would even go as far as saying that if I am typing this today , If I am living today then it's because of her. 

However , I am afraid I might lose her. She lives halfway across the world. While we plan to meet one day , it will probably be next year. I just feel like because of the distance I might end up losing her. I just wanted to know , how are ESFP's in general with friends ? For me personally , I don't intend to let go of people whom I have let inside. 

Am I overthinking ? Am I worrying too much ?   


All in all , I just wanna know how you would deal with situations like these ? ",1538595245
ESFP,"I have an ESFP who has been grieving the accidental death of a very close family member for over 6 months. She barely goes to work, can't sleep, confesses that she's always irritated at things that would never bother her before, and you can tell when she's thinking of her loved one because she tears up but then refuses to talk about it. It's almost like she feels embarrassed or ashamed. I think she has a lot of guilt/blame/regret over her last interaction with this person. What she did wasn't ill-intended or even bad, but I think she keeps thinking that if only she had done something differently anyhow, it wouldn't have happened. 

She had a brief period right after the death where she indulged in a lot of drinking and sex. That seems to have abated, but she won't go to therapy or a support group, and she won't go to the doctor and ask for medication. I've suggested some self-care things like exercise and writing but she dismisses those too.

I know the grief process can take years, but I worry that she's not coping well. Then again I'm very different from her, so maybe this isn't as maladaptive as it comes across to me. What do you guys think? How do you deal with grief? And what approach would be most helpful to her under these circumstances? ",1538445980
ESFP,"Hello I am an ENFP and I recently made a post wondering what was going down with my ESFP friend's attitude. 
She's been blunt, rude, quick to lie, ungrateful, and anti-social for the past several days. 
She's been like this before, but she always apologizes soon after and explains the reason why. It's usually related to anxiety. However, this time it's lasted for almost 5 days. 
The only times she has been normal are when she's back around her boyfriend. She randomly will be amicable and laughing but only when she's making fun of me. 
She's always been sort of pretentious, but always kind and complimentary. I know she's going through things with her family lately, and she can't go back home to see her family since they were affected by Hurricane Florence. They're all safe though, and last I heard doing fine. 
If she ever looks grumpy, or angry, and I ask her what's up, she gets frustrated at me. 
The other day, I gave her and several others a ride to a film festival 30 minutes away, and she didn't say thank you when the others did, and was a backseat driver the whole way. She was rapping along to her rap music, and I could tell got frustrated when I asked her to change the music because it was distracting. 
My question is, 
any idea why she's acting like this, and also what's the best way to approach her and tell her that she's hurting me (or if that's a terrible idea), or if you have any idea when she'll stop?",1538337259
ESFP,"I‚Äôve been studying mbti for a few months, and I‚Äôve identified as ESFP for the longest time. 

But to be honest, I‚Äôve been reading about the functions, and there are things about Se that I absolutely do not relate to. 

‚ÄúEye for aesthetics?‚Äù

‚ÄúGood at making an impact on their physical enviroment?‚Äù

‚ÄúEnergetic and aware of their surroundings?‚Äù

I‚Äôd be bullcrapping myself if I tried to even slightly pretend to fit into that stuff. 

I‚Äôve asked various people and they all agreed that everything that doesn‚Äôt apply to me for Se are really strong indicators and the fact that they don‚Äôt apply to me, well, it‚Äôs not my dominant function then. I shouldn‚Äôt have to shit myself to fit into something that‚Äôs seemingly my ‚Äúnatural process.‚Äù 

The only thing I can relate to for Se is living more in the present, and some of the inferior Ni stuff, but other than that I‚Äôm clumsy, uncoordinated, definitely not the life of the party, and damn oblivious, that alone eliminates Se lmao.

I know I have high Fi, and I know I‚Äôm an extravert, so default the only functions I could possibly have first is either Se or Ne, and since it ain‚Äôt Se, there‚Äôs only one other way it could go.

As soon as we left, she came across like she was almost upset with me even though I did nothing. I asked her about it and she said nothing was wrong. She‚Äôs been like this before, but it was when she felt anxious in a crowded environment and she directed her discomfort towards me because she knew I could take it.

I feel like I am very much an ESFP, and a turbulent one at that.

I started a job this year that kinda sucks. I sit at a desk 8-5 and type out code allllllll day. Sounds like torture for an ESFP - a fact I didn't consider when I was aiming for this industry. 

The job has slowly turned me into a monotonous, pretty unhappy guy. I feel like I have lost my spark that I used to have during the day, and it will only appear on the weekends again now. What makes it worse is I left a good job which had a good balance of social to it to come here (and better $$). I keep beating myself up for it, but also too scared to go find another job impulsively due to how it would screw people over here, and probably not look good by any means. Ontop of that idk what role to even go for (Full Stack Developer atm, definitely not that :P)

ESFP,"Some background (you can skip it if you don‚Äôt want to read it or you think it‚Äôll influence your answer):

&gt;!I‚Äôve always thought I was an ESFP but someone told me that I display more Fi than Se, which would make me an ISFP. In the mbti letters, ESFP makes perfect sense and I can‚Äôt really imagine being something else, but when the functions get involved I apparently have more Fi.!&lt;

So I‚Äôm going to try to give points that support both sides and I‚Äôd like to hear your opinions.

**ISFP:**

‚Ä¢ I always score the highest in Fi on tests, which aren‚Äôt really designed to show you your lower functions, just your first one, and they mostly point to Fi.

‚Ä¢ I can‚Äôt imagine being a se dom because extraverted sensing is portrayed in such a yOLO IDGAF sporty way everywhere. Se in ESFPs vs ISFPs are described so differently:

&gt; Dominant Se is what gives ESFPs that need for sensory experiences. [...] It‚Äôs what would drive them to be the life of the party, as indeed some are.

&gt; Auxiliary Function: Se - The next function in the stack is Extroverted Sensing (Se). ISFPs will tend to appear casual and laid back, as most Extroverted Perceivers do.

[Source](http://www.practicalmbti.com)

I definitely relate more to the open ‚Äúgo-with-the-flow‚Äù whatever approach to life in the ISFP description more than the ‚ÄúI need external stimulation 24/7 and can‚Äôt sit still‚Äù ESFP description.  

‚Ä¢ I do care a lot about my identity (which is why I‚Äôm even into MBTI in the first place haha), and if someone screws one of my values, depending on how important it is for me I‚Äôll stand up for it and stay true to it until the end. If it‚Äôs some piddly thing, I‚Äôm more likely to avoid the conflict because it‚Äôs not worth losing a friendship over, but if they are trying to force me into changing my views I will not budge no matter how much trouble it gets me into.

**ESFP:** 

‚Ä¢ I do relate to the inferior Ni tendencies like not thinking before I say/do stuff and it affects my social life too. Also feeling like my future is screwed over forever when I‚Äôm under stress and I noticed that I feel like it‚Äôs going to go in one specific path and then end up hopeless in the end. 

‚Ä¢ I definitely love social gatherings and chances to hang out with people. I do have social anxiety in certain situations but I tend to do better with people who are older than me. As a child I always jumped into conversations and pictures and my family never would have called me quiet and reserved. Although I don‚Äôt mind my time alone, I never turn down an invitation or cancel a plan just to stay home.

‚Ä¢ I never really cared to stand out by dying my hair or wearing excessive jewelry or wearing obscene clothing. I stick to a normal clothing style and just want to live my life day by day. I try not to overthink stuff and I try to ask for as little as possible. Wake up, do whatever‚Äôs necessary, and if something exciting comes up like an invitation I‚Äôll go. It‚Äôs really that simple for me. If I have the money, then yeah, why not? I‚Äôll pay for dinner. Just simple stuff like that.

ESFP,"I thought I was ENFP and am in the ENFP subreddit but someone commented I might be an ESFP because of all the things I want to do:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

""Unemployed currently but when I get a job I aspire to save money and buy equipment to start a YouTube channel to showcase my acting and humor and writing. I also want to act, write, and direct film and TV. And write books and comics (and draw comics). And be a comedian. Maybe a talk show host. A singer in a band or solo or both. A detective. A superhero (I legitimately was studying science in college with the aim to get a genetic engineering degree and make me super). Many other things.""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I have studied the functions and thought I was ENFP but now reading about ESFP and the differences between ENFP and ESFP I don't know! :O I seem to possess strong parts of both. I have strong Fi and can use Te pretty well too which are common between them but I can't figure out if I lead with Ne or Se. And as for Si or Ne I'm not sure I fully understand them to be honest.

&amp;#x200B;

Ne:

&amp;#x200B;

I have a basically unlimited imagination. I saw a test once where you had to name 5 or 10 other things you can use a fork for (or a spoon, can't remember). I can name 10 easily. I can name 50, 100.

&amp;#x200B;

I can think of something random like Godzilla waltzing through a city with a mop, sweeping all the people into the sea, but knowing in the prophecy this would happen dolphins built an underwater shopping mall that he people can shop and walk around in while they wait for Godzilla to die of exhaustion. Then they will rebuild their city in his bones and remember him with a traditional ceremonial needlepoint contest.

&amp;#x200B;

I can think of a solution to any problem, 10 solutions, more.

&amp;#x200B;

I love to read fantasy books. Regular literary books set in the ""real world"" seem boring to me.

&amp;#x200B;

I am always looking for new ways to do things. It sometimes is about efficiency which is very important to me because of Te but I can actually think of so many ways things can be improved or made faster, more efficient, streamlined, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Se:

&amp;#x200B;

All my sense are extremely keen. I'm a visual learner and I see something I can understand it instantly, as opposed to trying to read about it. I can always notice details and things no one else can, for example I always see hidden animals that no one even noticed. My ears are very sensitive to any noise and I can't sleep unless I have a fan going to block out any noise that might occur. I am a supertaster and find many things way too bitter to eat, like most vegetables and coffee, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I also have always been naturally extremely gifted at any artistic endeavor. I have always been able to draw very well even as a kid and was always the kid everyone wanted to draw pictures for them. I can paint well, sculpt well, do any kind of art well without training. I can see extreme details in art and when creating art.

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see I am also very interested in performing arts, acting, singing, comedy, dancing, improv, etc.

I also don't like philosophical conversations like ""why are we here? ""What is the meaning of happiness?"" ""What is good and evil?"" Something I've been known to say is that philosophy is just mental masturbation. It goes nowhere and has no point. It's asking questions with no answers, just opinions.

&amp;#x200B;

When I'm reading and see a description I can picture it very well, extremely detailed. If someone says something like ""chandelier"" I can picture the chandelier in extremely detail down to the decorative metal designs. I can picture the ceiling, the windows covered in velvet drapes, the color of them the texture. I can see the whole room and all the details.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

As far as focusing on the future and possibilities or the present I don't know. I don't know what I'll be doing in 5 years, 2, or even tomorrow and I like that but I still dream and imagine future careers and scenarios. I do sometimes talk about different ways the world is changing and will change in the near future. I don't often talk about people and what they doing, rumors, etc. but that may be because I have no social life (see other post about having no friends).

ESFP,"I‚Äôm in a relationship with an ESFP, and it has been great so far (for a year and a half), up until a few months ago. I took a new job several months after we started dating, and I told her I would only take the job if she moved with me. It wasn‚Äôt a dream job, but it was a small step up. The move was hard on both of us. I hated the job when I first started, she was unemployed for 3 months, and when she got a job she hated it. Yet she wouldn‚Äôt quit. We don‚Äôt have any friends in the new place, and it‚Äôs a small town, so it‚Äôs been difficult for us to meet people. 5-6 months after the move I noticed some changes in her personality. She was no longer bubbly and enthusiastic. When we first got here and I realized I did not like the job, she was a huge support for me and said I should give it a chance, find the best in it, etc. However, when I noticed her becoming somewhat depressed, she wouldn‚Äôt listen to the same advice she gave me. And she refused to quit her job because she didn‚Äôt want to seem like a job hopper. I also suggested that she see a therapist, but she said it wasn‚Äôt that bad and she didn‚Äôt need it. She finally resigned from her job but then has gone home for a little while to ‚Äúget help‚Äù and have some ‚Äútime and space.‚Äù I‚Äôm just so confused over her reasoning for doing this the way she did. 

As I see it, our situation here is very simple: she hated her job, and we have no friends here. That‚Äôs a very dark place for an ESFP to be. Why didn‚Äôt she take my suggestions to quit sooner and look for other jobs? I‚Äôve asked her if she wants to break up, and she says no, but at the same time she won‚Äôt let me help her. It‚Äôs like there‚Äôs a wall around her emotions (fear, insecurity, whatever) that she won‚Äôt let me break down.

Maybe this speaks to you the way it speaks to me :,) If not, oh well. It‚Äôs from a letter Jack Kerouac wrote to his wife: 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;‚ÄúI have lots of things to teach you now, in case we ever meet, concerning the message that was transmitted to me under a pine tree in North Carolina on a cold winter moonlit night. It said that Nothing Ever Happened, so don‚Äôt worry. It‚Äôs all like a dream. Everything is ecstasy, inside. We just don‚Äôt know it because of our thinking-minds. But in our true blissful essence of mind is known that everything is alright forever and forever and forever. Close your eyes, let your hands and nerve-ends drop, stop breathing for 3 seconds, listen to the silence inside the illusion of the world, and you will remember the lesson you forgot, which was taught in immense milky way soft cloud innumerable worlds long ago and not even at all. It is all one vast awakened thing. I call it the golden eternity. It is perfect.   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;We were never really born, we will never really die. It has nothing to do with the imaginary idea of a personal self, other selves, many selves everywhere: Self is only an idea, a mortal idea. That which passes into everything is one thing. It‚Äôs a dream already ended. There‚Äôs nothing to be afraid of and nothing to be glad about. I know this from staring at mountains months on end. They never show any expression, they are like empty space. Do you think the emptiness of space will ever crumble away? Mountains will crumble, but the emptiness of space, which is the one universal essence of mind, the vast awakenerhood, empty and awake, will never crumble away because it was never born. The world you see is just a movie in your mind. Rocks don‚Äôt see it. Bless and sit down. Forgive and forget.   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;*Practice kindness all day to everybody and you will realize you‚Äôre already in heaven now.* That‚Äôs the story. That‚Äôs the message. Nobody understands it, nobody listens, they‚Äôre all running around like chickens with heads cut off. I will try to teach it but it will be in vain, s'why I‚Äôll end up in a shack praying and being cool and singing by my woodstove making pancakes.‚Äù

ESFP,"Haven't found a lot of pages talking about this, so I figured it was high time for me to make one.  


So, recently reevaluating myself after coming off of my SSRIs, I realized the reason I started taking them in the first place; my true and utter hatred of Extraverted Intuition.  


Now, while I think Ne CAN be useful, and don't think it is a function that should be wiped off the face of the planet, I find myself shockingly antagonistic whenever I'm having to deal with it. For instance, when I'm hungry, I HATE it when 15-20 minutes are spent talking about ALL the possible places to eat in the area instead of just picking something that sounds tasty and then going; in other words, when Extraverted Intuition is unregulated by any judging function and allowed to run amok.  


Being an action/fantasy/sci-fi writer, I have been extremely envious of those capable of using Ne to generate fresh, new ideas (rather than doing what I do and recycling old ideas and then changing details so that they seem fresh). When I actively TRY to use Extraverted Intuition to generate a 'new idea', it often comes across as half-baked. However, whenever I go through being moody and insecure, my brain just naturally sets off on an unanchored journey through intuition-land; when this happens, I entirely disassociate and start to exhibit symptoms of Borderline personality disorder, jumping to conclusions, panicking, suddenly feeling like my identity and sense of self is being threatened by all the possibilities, what I COULD be.   


In one online source (forgot the link; sorry!), I read that Demonic Ne in ESxPs tends to manifest as ""confusing possibilities for realities"" or ""jumping to conclusions"". Many, MANY people over the years have accused me of ""jumping to conclusions"", and I myself in recent years have noticed I have a tendency to confuse people's ""might be"" with ""is/will be"", because with sensing there is often an ""is"" and an ""isn't"", and so I don't operate well on ambiguity.

She cared for me, showed it, and always helped me, and was there to make me happy. But something happened about 10 days ago. I approached her and she was irritated with my behavior. She said she found it annoying. I felt really bad. Like how could I ever make someone so lovely feel like that. And I didn't understand it either. And then later, she apologized for her behavior and said she just wasn't feeling well. On that same day, I'd approached her asking about how she was doing and if anything had happened. She didn't say anything. She said, she was alright. Even though she clearly wasn't. I'd spent more time with her than usual on that day because I was leaving for a vacation. And later, when she apologized, she told me that she hated that attitude of hers, the attitude that made her lie, and she felt really bad that she'd made me worried. After that day, I went on a vacation with my family. And since then, in texts, she has stopped giving me her attention and affection like she used to. She still says she loves me and misses me but her actions don't match her words.

My best guess as to what's up is that, she's losing her respect n trust for me and she still has love for me but doesn't want to hurt me. And we don't text each other as often as we used to because she just doesn't respond much. She won't talk about it either. She really won't talk about anything. She only responds to what I talk about. Or what I need her for. I don't know how I can help this problem. I've tried not texting her and paying much attention to her n doing my own thing. I've tried telling her how much I do love her and showering her with my attention. I've tried asking her about how's she doing. It all ends into nothing. 

I'm not afraid of losing her. Because I know I won't. But I just don't understand it. Did I hurt her when I told her that I'd felt bad that I annoyed her? She said she never wanted me to feel sad or bad or anything in this relationship. And that she wasn't good for me. I told her it didn't matter if she felt that way, because I'd fallen in love with her n I didn't care if she thought she wasn't good for me. I would keep being there for her. I said all this. But it only pushed her further away from me. That's how I feel. ",1531240765

ESFP,"I honestly don‚Äôt mind it. I‚Äôm not going out of my way to be alone, and I‚Äôd much rather not be, but if I absolutely have to be alone in my room all day because no one is available or some other circumstance is preventing me from going out, I don‚Äôt mind it.

I‚Äôm not the kind of person who goes outside to play sports or wanders around the house aimlessly or ‚ÄòADHD-ishly.‚Äô I don‚Äôt get restless when I‚Äôm alone. I don‚Äôt mind just relaxing in bed watching funny vines or interesting YouTube videos. I stay in one spot doing things on my phone or computer and the time just flies right by. If I don‚Äôt have any internet or any computer/phone, I will sleep the day away, also killing time because I would get super bored if I had to stay awake the whole day doing nothing in a room. 

I have to admit though, as much as I don‚Äôt mind being alone for long periods of time, it makes me a bit feel groggy and unaccomplished and sometimes irritable. It‚Äôs easy to forget about it when I‚Äôm laying in bed playing fortnite or something, but when I get back out there it‚Äôs like ‚Äúdamn I missed so much‚Äù and my head feels cloudy. This actually might be unrelated to this topic all together and it‚Äôs happening because I‚Äôm staying in one place for a long time and I‚Äôm just making a foolish mess out of myself, but whatever, I‚Äôm just sharing this to see if any ESFPs or any other type for that matter experiences this too. 

On the other hand though, when I‚Äôm spending the day with my friends and riding around in the car and doing stuff, I don‚Äôt feel cloudy and weighed down like I do when I step out of my room after being alone for a day. I feel much clearer and less like a fat slob. Like I said, probably completely unrelated to mbti but I just felt the need to share this.

ESFP,"#**MBTI**

I‚Äôm very sure about being ESFP. I relate to most of the descriptions, I made a couple of type me posts [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/8dxs0c/yet_another_type_me_post/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/8hy2xz/type_me_questionnaire/) and got ESFP pretty consistently. I also feel like I line up with the esfp functions (mostly). I know for sure I have fi and inferior ni and the Se description doesn‚Äôt sound too off (apart from being physically graceful lmao). I considered ENFP and ISFJ at one point during this confusing mess but they don‚Äôt match nearly as much as ESFP does. 

Here are some Mbti ESFP descriptions that resonate with me: 

&gt; ESFP is definitely a spontaneous, optimistic individual. They love to have fun. If the ESFP has not developed their Thinking side by giving consideration to rational thought processing, they tend to become over-indulgent, and place more importance on immediate sensation and gratification than on their duties and obligations. They may also avoid looking at long-term consequences of their actions.

&gt; The ESFP is a great team player. He or she is not likely to create any problems or fuss, and is likely to create the most fun environment possible for getting the task done.

&gt; Utterly social, ESFPs enjoy the simplest things, and there‚Äôs no greater joy for them than just having fun with a good group of friends.

&gt; There‚Äôs nothing that makes ESFPs feel quite as unhappy as realizing that they are boxed in by circumstance, unable to join their friends.

&gt; ESFPs sometimes ignore and avoid conflict entirely. They tend to say and do what‚Äôs needed to get out of such situations, then move on to something more fun.

&gt; #**Authority and social status are secondary to feeling like they‚Äôre an important part of a team that gets the job done.**

&gt; Sounds like a great idea! They don‚Äôt even care where they are going, as long as they get to hang out with friends and have a good time.

&gt; ESFPs hold values of sympathy, tactfulness and care toward their peers. ESFPs can appear casual, flexible and easy-going, but when they feel something or someone they value has been slighted, they will stand firm and stubborn.

&gt; Se-doms can be emotionally triggered in a variety of ways, such as: being judged as immature or superficial or incompetent, feeling that others doubt the legitimacy of their talents or achievements, not receiving positive feedback for their work, being criticized when they have put out a lot of effort, spending too much time with overly serious or impractical people, working with inflexible/cynical/uncooperative/incompetent people, being pressured to make long term commitments, being pressured into making decisions that can have a major impact on future developments, feeling as though alternatives or options are being closed off, being forced to work in excessively structured environments, enduring rigid routines or procedural work for long periods, feeling pressured to conform to other people‚Äôs rules or schedules, tight deadlines or onerous supervision, feeling a lack of stimulation or variety, feeling disorganized or mentally clouded, feeling unable to solve problems quickly and efficiently, being overwhelmed by too many duties or a heavy workload.



#**SOCIONICS**

Now that I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not mistyped in mbti, I went on to read some of the socionics descriptions and see what it had to say about ESFPs. 

I found a whole ton of crap like 

&gt; SEE ‚Äì ESFp ‚Äì Napoleon (Leader)
&gt; The SEE is characterized by the drive to expand his influence, by the desire of authority and glory. In order to realize these goals it is necessary to learn how to control people, by manipulating their weaknesses and avoiding their strengths so as to never be conquered.

&gt;  Se doms tend to use the physical aspect of power to sway others. This includes but is not limited to intimidation, gaslighting, persistence, among others. Some dial up the charm, knowing that a lot of ppl respond to easy going ppl sometimes more drastically than the intimidation route. These are the aw shucks types that seem to always be down to do things with others, hoping their charm will convince others to comply.

&gt; ""I - the most powerful man in the world, rookie."" 
&gt; It is very self-confident in their own abilities, he believes that can do everything. Often the impression voluntarist: I think it's right, then it should be good for everyone. It produces an impression of a strong man, he seemed to always have enough space around, ""like a bull in a china shop."" If he is physically strong, that despises ""wimps"", if the opposite is weak, then all athletes - ""redneck"". Often good handle money, but these issues are either too conservative or too cocky. Life is perceived through the prism of power ""who is who"". In order to be heard by them, you need to force yourself to respect in any way. Any weakness of man perceived as a disadvantage, so often they can use it, not seeing anything wrong. Always do something, developing skills. Usually, their strength is visible to the naked eye, but it lacks flexibility, rather it is something monumental and conservative. Always try to be just the first in any case, if this does not work, something very angry. If their strength and ability to question, it should also be a flash of aggression. Potentially - excellent athletes, but a constant re-evaluation of their own forces is fraught with injuries. Preaches the cult of power and skill, confident in their external data. It asserts its exclusivity, uniqueness. He does not consider it necessary to get someone on the approval of this or that act, and the decision is made ‚Äã‚Äãby a very arrogant. Do not hesitate to use force anywhere. Angry, annoyed, if someone it ""contradict"" and is externally visible. 

&gt; SEE - this is a strong, domineering personality. A girl of seven years creating a lot of problems to parents: she fights with anyone who contradicts her in something. And most importantly, that she wins even in a fight with the boys.

&gt; Even he likes to control people, or rather, it is in the blood. The chief-SEE everything must be subordinated.

&gt; The individual feels at home among people who are actively doing something and interacting with each other directly (visibly), and is able to organize people, move them around as necessary, and guide them in achieving a specific goal. He or she likes obedience and even subservience in others, since it allows him to ""make things happen"" more effectively.


#Geez, what happened?!??

I know if you‚Äôre on r/mbti you‚Äôve probably gotten sick and tired of me obsessing over this stuff. But seriously. I can relate to jack squat in socionics but I‚Äôve never been more sure of being ESFP in mbti. 

I posted threads similar to this in r/mbti and they concluded that I‚Äôm actually an ESFj in socionics. But that‚Äôs still confusing, because I thought the p and j were only supposed to switch for introverts?

I came here to see what y‚Äôall thought. This is very confusing and I‚Äôd appreciate if I could get this clarified. Thank you for taking the time to read this. ",1528819266

ESFP,,1528518735
ESFP,"So, here is the whole story (I'm really sorry in advance for any grammar mistakes or misspellings and really sorry for really long text):

I was seeing some girl, I‚Äôd love to call it dating, but she‚Äôd always say ‚Äúwe‚Äôre not dating yet‚Äù. So, it all started at the bar, I was going out a lot back then, I was trying to get over my previous relationship and honestly, as soon as I met this girl I completely forgot about my ex. This girl was sitting on the couch at the patio with her sister. I approached them and asked them if they‚Äôre Mediterranean they said no, they‚Äôre Mexican, We started talking about various things, everything went well and even my friend came to wingman me talking to her sister. I remember I even told the girl that I‚Äôd love to take her out and that I‚Äôm not playing, I really liked her and later when me and my friend went outside we saw from the far some dude kinda bothering them I went to them with my friend and took the guy off. Specific interesting moment from that moment was that I just came and stood next to her and when the guy asked ''how do you know her?'' she said ‚Äúwe‚Äôre dating‚Äù and I repeated after her ‚Äúyeah, we‚Äôre dating‚Äù and that was such a good feeling for me, because I didn‚Äôt expect her to say that, I was even afraid that she will reject my help to handle that guy. But everything went well, we started walking all (me, her, her sister, my friend) together to the parking lot holding hands. And it turned out they live at the same apartment complex that I live in and their building is right by mine. But she actually doesn‚Äôt live in the same town that I live, she lives 3.5 hrs away but she comes very often on weekends to visit her sister. So anyway, we reached that apartment complex, her sister and my friend walked away with her sister, kinda leaving us alone. And this girl came to me after getting off from the car and started making out with me, I didn‚Äôt even initiate that, she started kissing me. That was also very happy moment for me, because I had very low expectations, I didn‚Äôt think that she really likes me, because she is above average in my opinion and I thought she probably gets a lot of guys like me hitting on her and I‚Äôm no different (later, I found out that she actually participated in some beauty contest during her undergrad and she took the 2nd place, I never imagined that kind of girl would be into me lol). And then we walked and sat in front of their building and she came to sit on my knees, that was so sweet. Honestly, at that moment, I felt like I sealed the deal, that she‚Äôs mine, that we‚Äôre gonna date and stuff. And then I got her number and snapchat before I left. And then after that night, the next day we went to coffee place (I invited her). I tried to kiss her there, but she covered her face with her hands and laughed and said ‚Äúyou‚Äôre making me shy‚Äù. But then after coffee, before leaving I told her something like that I‚Äôd want to date her, but then after seeing her kinda confused facial expression, I tried to fix my mistake, briefly I just messed it up, but she asked ‚Äúyou mean you‚Äôd want to see me again?‚Äù and I said ‚Äúyes, exactly‚Äù. Anyway, after all this, we were talking for some time through Snapchat. And the first thing she told me was that she was engaged for some time and she was supposed to get married last summer but then she called it off (she didn‚Äôt tell me what the reason was) and she told me ‚Äúshe was deeply in love‚Äù and ‚Äúimagine frustration coming after that‚Äù and she offered to be friends. And first I rejected that saying something like I would not play games with her, it‚Äôd either be relationship or nothing. Then the next day I agreed to be friends. I know, I know, I messed it up a lot, I‚Äôm embarrassed. Then we‚Äôve been talking for some time, and I need to be honest, although she was randomly snapchatting me but we were never really talking about something and at the beginning she wouldn‚Äôt even accept my invitation to go for a lunch or smth even with her sister. Again, I have to be fair, at the beginning I was feeling pretty unhappy about how much we were communicating. But surprisingly, over the time, it got better, but to be honest I felt like it‚Äôs all because I was kinda pushing it. I started trying to keep her interested, sending her snaps/text that would make her laugh or make her interested or make her just to reply me with something, then we went for a dinner (me, her and her sister); then we hanged out few times, and then I even invited her to Coldplay concert (I payed for her). We went to that concert, that was probably the peak of my happiness. All the time we were together, we were making out during the concert, then we were making out all night after the concert at the parking lot by the building I live in. I don‚Äôt know if all this is very usual thing for her, but it was new experience for me and I felt really happy.
Then, after that, things get messed up, once when we were talking on SC, somehow we ended up talking about commitment and stuff, and basically, she was saying that she has no commitment with me and she can‚Äôt promise me that now, and I was being very frustrated by that and almost kinda judging her that it‚Äôs wrong that after all this to think that ‚Äúit‚Äôs okay to see other people‚Äù. Anyway, there were few other small fights again because of the same commitment thing. And then I did something that now, I think, was very immature and stupid: like 2 or 3 times I posted snaps with girls (like each time with one different girl). I did that trying to make her jealous. I don‚Äôt know what she thinks about it. But, anyway, the main reason she‚Äôs been mad at me because of trying to control her or make her not to talk to some guys. After that, I asked her to block me on SC (she didn‚Äôt want to do that btw) and I deleted her number and I didn‚Äôt talk to her for 4 months.
Now, after 4 months, although I deleted her from all social networks, somehow I still had her on my Whatsapp, so I texted her first asking how is everything and stuff and she replied. Then like a week later I saw her at the bar but didn‚Äôt even approach her and didn‚Äôt even talk to her, but looked at her few times, to be honest I felt like she was deliberately standing nearby just to be able to see me, but we never had an eyecontact. Anyway, few weeks later I texted her saying that it was pretty sad that I saw her but couldn‚Äôt even say hi, and she replied ''yeah it was a little weird'' and I replied that I just didn‚Äôt want to disturb her. Then few weeks later, I texted her again asking if she‚Äôs coming to the university X (university I‚Äôm studying at), and she replied (this time she replied fast, right after I texted ‚Äòhey‚Äô she said ‚Äòhi‚Äô) and she said that yes she already is living in town Y (the same town I‚Äôm living in) and then sent 3 more lines about how she‚Äôs looking for a part-time job and stuff and I replied saying that I'm glad that she got admitted.
So, probably you guys will criticize me on how much I messed it up and how pathetic I sound and that I should move on. I realize that myself too, but it‚Äôs easy to say than actually to do that, I tried to move on for 4 months, but somehow I ended up remembering her again.

So, anyway, dear ESFPs, I need advice from you, is it possible for me to win her back? I believe the only way I can run into her is some bar in my town that we both like going.

ESFP,"ESFP's have been a reoccurring love interests in my life.
&amp;nbsp;

I've been in love with this one ESFP since the very start of High School, at the beginning I thought she wouldn't even notice me, but for some strange reason we actually got pretty flipping close. Hugging, Pecking each other on the face every chance we get etc. etc. But I've always been conflicted about if I should make the move. The main reason is that I LOVE that caring, loving, compassionate side of here, where we just do nothing but hold each other, but I always feared that I would let her down if we were to get into a relationship. She loves to go out to parties every single weekend, and I absolutely HATE such crowded places. It's the biggest part of her social life and I just feel like that's going to be a big disconnect. Heck we even went out on 2 dates, to which SHE asked ME to, and I probably wasn't ever going to do it because of me being so conflicted. She's told everyone about me, like I used to be a pretty unknown figure around town, but she's talked to everyone about me I feel like 70% of the city that's our age knows about me now. She used to say that she loves how unique I am, how I have my own opinions and don't change them for anyone, how I'm not a person you meet everyday, how I have my own beliefs and values etc. And she used SOOO MANY signs that she likes me and wants to be with me, and she probably thinks I didn't notice any of them, but Oh I did, I noticed every single one of her body language signs I'm just a flarking idiot for not doing ANYTHING about it.
&amp;nbsp;

And now, I've lost her... And I don't blame her, she got tired of waiting on me she just got into a new relationship. And I convinced myself for a very large portion of time since then that I didn't care. Because the previous ""crushes"" I had that got into relationships always ended with me having big emotional outbursts, and I didn't have any when she got into a relationship. I just said to myself that we weren't for each other anyway because of how Extroverted she is, and because of how much I don't show emotion and just hold it all inside.
&amp;nbsp;

And with having her out of the picture I started noticing that I still have crushes that are ALL YOU! ESFPS! MY CURSE! I'm Cursed with loving creatuers that I can't have. I discovered this other girl that's a year younger than me that actually SAID that she likes me just from how I look and brief moments of her overhearing my conversations. But I sure as hell ain't gonna do nothing about it BECAUSE I'M A FLARKING INTROVERT THAT DOESN'T OPEN UP TO ANYBODY!!! (I'm not that introverted, I'm actually pretty talkative and whenever I take the online tests I usually get a good 54 to 46 percent Introversion to Extroversion, it's just that it doesn't matter how talkative and fun I am, I just don't show my inner emotions towards people and it's holding me back). And even tho this new girl is pretty cute and I'd really like to be with her, I still feel like the previous one is a 100% the perfect match for me. Sure she has a pretty extroverted social side but that's just 1 disconnect between us, we have so much in common, and we got sooo close to the point that we spent whole days close to each other.
&amp;nbsp;

But, maybe there's another option. Maybe I didn't actually love her truly, I think I just enjoyed having that closeness to someone. I've never been in a true relationship, and If anything I'd say that this relationship is the closest thing I had to an actual relationship because of that physical connection. She started the hugging and the kissing and I just enjoyed it to it's fullest. I don't know if I'll ever get to do that again. That's stopped now, we've stopped talking as much and the most physical connection we have is a quick hug... And I think that's what I miss the most.
&amp;nbsp;

Ok, I finished venting and ranting. I needed an outlet to just get it all out of me. I really, REALLY hope she doesn't get out of that relationship because I know as soon as she does she's gonna get close to me again and I'm gonna be destroyed. At least now I don't feel as strong emotions as I did when she was single, and if she gets single again we are a 100% gonna start hugging and kissing again and I  don't know if I can take it. I just know I'm not gonna do anything about it again and if I do it's going to be disappointing. If she does do that again I think the smartest option for me to do is to just say that she needs to stop being so physically close to me, that way there's some distance between us and I can fully get over her.

ESFP,"Does this sound like esfp

- I don‚Äôt mind listening to your ideas, but if don‚Äôt have any intention of putting them into action I‚Äôd rather not waste my time. 
- I focus on the present but occasionally I get nostalgic.
- I get bored if you try to talk about my future. I try to waste as little time on that stuff as possible. Things don‚Äôt stay the same and more often than not you‚Äôre going to end up adapting to the changes anyway.
- I find that the emotions of the people around me influence me a lot. If I‚Äôm around someone who‚Äôs cussing at their phone or someone else, I feel uncomfortable. If I‚Äôm around someone who‚Äôs always laughing and talking and making jokes and stuff, I feel encouraged to do the same.
- I feel awkward when I‚Äôm alone and I‚Äôd rather be around a lot of people. 
- I find myself needing a lot of affirmation.
- I find myself focusing on the details in the real world more than details about myself.
- If it doesn‚Äôt have a deadline, it isn‚Äôt getting done unless it‚Äôs actually important to me.
- I‚Äôd rather spend time having fun and being happy as much as possible than doing chores and dwelling over stuff that doesn‚Äôt affect me right now. 
- When I‚Äôm cooking, I‚Äôd rather have an actual recipe with proportions so I know what the heck I‚Äôm doing. 
- I‚Äôd rather rely on facts that are confirmed and true than fluffy theories that may or may not be accurate. 
- I don‚Äôt care if plans change at the last minute. It happens. It just opens up more options. 
- It‚Äôs very important to me to be accepted and liked in my community. 
- I think drama is rather exciting and fun to have in my life. But when it goes too far and starts to screw things up, that‚Äôs when I start to get really nervous. If it gets to that point I‚Äôll try to act happy and upbeat and try to make others feel the same way and maybe make the drama less threatening, but if it obviously isn‚Äôt helping I‚Äôll just sit there and shake with anxiety. 
- I find that commercials and ads with an emotional appeal have more of an effect on me than ones with a bunch of numbers and percentages. 
- People are always telling me to think before I speak but I never do that. 
- If something is important or significant to me, I‚Äôll remember a lot about it. 
- It makes me feel sooooo awful when for whatever reason I have to stand far away from a group of people. I‚Äôd much rather be among them.
- I hate relying on strict plans because I‚Äôve never seen one work out the way it‚Äôs supposed to. *Things change.*
- If I feel strongly about a subject, I have absolutely no problem expressing my feelings about it. But if it‚Äôs likely that it will cause a conflict or a giant argument, I‚Äôll just keep my mouth shut. 
- I can say something with confidence for once: I‚Äôm a procrastinator. As I said in my previous post, if it isn‚Äôt affecting me or my loved ones right this second, it doesn‚Äôt matter. I‚Äôll only do it if I absolutely have to, and most likely I‚Äôll start it the same day it‚Äôs due. 
- I can‚Äôt take criticism. It comes across to me as an insult and makes me feel like crap. 
- If I‚Äôm being disrespectful, I‚Äôm not doing it on purpose. I‚Äôll most likely apologize if you bring it to my attention.
- I love assignments and essays that allow me to express myself. 
- If someone has a suggestion that we are able to act on *right now,* I‚Äôm always the first one to jump out of my chair and go. If it‚Äôs a suggestion that may or may not happen in the future, I don‚Äôt waste any time or energy on it. Because I know from experience that those lovely little ‚Äúpossibilities‚Äù and ‚Äúideas‚Äù never work out if it requires too much planning in advance. 
- If I do something foolish that causes me to be ashamed, I‚Äôll try to distract myself from it with other things. If I‚Äôm unable to do that and I‚Äôm left alone with my thoughts, I feel like garbage.
- If I ask someone a question and they don‚Äôt answer in .00000000009 seconds I assume they didn‚Äôt hear me or they‚Äôre ignoring me. 
- I feel like I can go forever without being alone and that would actually be great lol. 
- As much as I want to keep your secret, more times than not I‚Äôll spill the beans without even realizing it. 
- I don‚Äôt mind a loud environment. I think it‚Äôs really awesome.
- I‚Äôll tell a complete stranger pretty much everything that‚Äôs going on in my life and how I feel about it. I‚Äôve gotten into a ton of trouble because of that. 
- I honestly don‚Äôt like being in control or in a leadership position lol. I‚Äôd rather let someone else take care of that stuff and I can just go with the flow.
- If I do end up making a to-do list I‚Äôll never follow through with it. 
- When I‚Äôm at a restraunt I tend to order the same thing because I‚Äôm comfortable with it. But if someone suggusts something to me, unless there‚Äôs a really good reason not to get it, I‚Äôll try it. 
- When I visit someone‚Äôs house and it‚Äôs cluttered and messy, I actually admire it. It comes across to me as they‚Äôre living their life to the fullest instead of gushing over how everything is displayed. As long as you know where everything is, it doesn‚Äôt matter at all. Why waste your time on that stuff? It makes no difference.

Below is an overview of the Big 5 for those who are unfamiliar.

-----

[*From wikipedia:*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits)

&gt; * **Openness** to experience (inventive/curious vs. consistent/cautious)  
Appreciation for art, emotion, adventure, unusual ideas, curiosity, and variety of experience. Openness reflects the degree of intellectual curiosity, creativity and a preference for novelty and variety a person has. It is also described as the extent to which a person is imaginative or independent and depicts a personal preference for a variety of activities over a strict routine. High openness can be perceived as unpredictability or lack of focus, and more likely to engage in risky behaviour or drug taking. Also, individuals that have high openness tend to lean towards being artists or writers in regards to being creative and appreciate the significance of the intellectual and artistic pursuits. Moreover, individuals with high openness are said to pursue self-actualization specifically by seeking out intense, euphoric experiences. Conversely, those with low openness seek to gain fulfillment through perseverance and are characterized as pragmatic and data-driven‚Äîsometimes even perceived to be dogmatic and closed-minded. Some disagreement remains about how to interpret and contextualize the openness factor.

&gt;* **Conscientiousness** (efficient/organized vs. easy-going/careless)  
A tendency to be organized and dependable, show self-discipline, act dutifully, aim for achievement, and prefer planned rather than spontaneous behavior. High conscientiousness is often perceived as stubbornness and obsession. Low conscientiousness is associated with flexibility and spontaneity, but can also appear as sloppiness and lack of reliability.

&gt;* **Extraversion** (outgoing/energetic vs. solitary/reserved)  
Energy, positive emotions, surgency, assertiveness, sociability and the tendency to seek stimulation in the company of others, and talkativeness. High extraversion is often perceived as attention-seeking, and domineering. Low extraversion causes a reserved, reflective personality, which can be perceived as aloof or self-absorbed. Extroverted people tend to be more dominant in social settings, opposed to introverted people who may act more shy and reserved in this setting.

&gt;* **Agreeableness** (friendly/compassionate vs. challenging/detached)  
A tendency to be compassionate and cooperative rather than suspicious and antagonistic towards others. It is also a measure of one's trusting and helpful nature, and whether a person is generally well-tempered or not. High agreeableness is often seen as naive or submissive. Low agreeableness personalities are often competitive or challenging people, which can be seen as argumentativeness or untrustworthiness.

&gt;* **Neuroticism** (sensitive/nervous vs. secure/confident)  
Neuroticism identifies certain people who are more prone to psychological stress. The tendency to experience unpleasant emotions easily, such as anger, anxiety, depression, and vulnerability. Neuroticism also refers to the degree of emotional stability and impulse control and is sometimes referred to by its low pole, ""emotional stability"". A high stability manifests itself as a stable and calm personality, but can be seen as uninspiring and unconcerned. A low stability expresses as a reactive and excitable personality, often very dynamic individuals, but they can be perceived as unstable or insecure. It has also been researched that individuals with higher levels of tested neuroticism, tend to have worse psychological well being.

[*From a peer-reviewed paper:*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0191886996000335):

&gt;The NEO-PI Agreeableness score was correlated only with the thinking-feeling (T-F) dimension; the NEO-PI Conscientiousness score was correlated with both thinking-feeling and judging-perceiving (J-P) dimension; the NEO-PI Extraversion score was strongly correlated with the extraversion-introversion (E-I) dimensions, while the Neuroticism score from the NEO-PI was not related to any MBTI subscale score. The openness dimension was correlated with all four especially sensing-intuitive.",1521979807
ESFP,"If an ESFP was very close (relationship) to you, and carried you in a way as if you meant the world to them, always cared for you, and wasn't afraid of showing you that they love you, and said loving things that went beyond the limits sometimes, and always made you feel special, would it be appropriate to doubt their feelings? I don't think so. But would it?

But when I see that something is definitely not good, and they still say it's good, I can't come to a conclusion whether what they say is actually true (not a lie) or they're just saying it to make me feel better?",1521201374

ESFP,"I have a good friend who is an ESFP. Before I get into my problem with her, I'll say this. She's kind, she's thoughtful, she's hilarious, she's wonderful as a person and I value her friendship deeply. Our friendship means a lot. She's genuinely special to me and I'm only asking the following questions in order to preserve our friendship. 

So. My problem. I work with her. At the moment, I work a little above her. She is on a team I am responsible for. And, though I love her in informal friendship settings, she is incredibly immature and unprofessional in situations that require professionalism. We're meeting with investors at the moment, as we need funding for this project. She is manic, bordering on panicked in these meetings. It's genuinely embarrassing to be in a meeting with professionals with her- she stresses out in front of them, scrambles for the answers to questions, has no sense of order when presenting our case, scatters notes across the table, interrupts me frequently, despite me being midway through a presentation. 

I am also struggling with being technically 'in charge' of her. She is really quite unreliable- she struggles to meet deadlines, and if I ask her for something more than once she takes it personally. If I ask a question to understand what she meant by something in her notes, she takes it personally. She has a specific expression and tone that I know well; it means her feelings are hurt and I may well hear about it later. If I take a moment with someone else on the team, she asks me later why she wasn't included- well, because it wasn't your area and had nothing to do with what you're working on. 

I love her, I care about her, but I'm getting very frustrated with her. How do I gently ask her to be professional at work? And how can I help her stop feeling like she has to... I don't know, fix things with me? She's also getting to a point where she can absolutely sense my frustration and as a result is trying extra hard. I really don't like it when she tries so hard, I like it when she's just herself- but lately she's been forcing humour, trying to be funny rather than letting it come naturally as it usually does to her, messaging me twice as much as usual, asking me if we're okay almost every day, and it's driving me a little insane. I just want her to be a little more professional at work and know where the line is. 

I don't want to hurt her feelings, but she seems to be so easily offended at times. It's getting to the point where I'm starting to get irritated with her in non-work settings just because her behaviour is reminding me of what she's doing at work. 
I'm sorry if this sounds judgemental, I really do care about her, but I'm getting so exhausted with balancing her and work. ",1520818333

ESFP,"as there are a lot of silly stereotypes and weird typing-questions, im a bit confused because i tested as many types before, enfj, enfp, isfp, infj and well, now as esfp, which feels more right than the others.
maybe you are able to help me being sure ( hope it won't be getting too long).
most questions are somehow misleading, i have a perfect memory, live in the now but am also pretty much intuitive about certain things.

but let's start at the beginning, some relevant memories:
as a child ive been adventurous and curious,jumped headfirst into our pond because i wanted to see the fish in their environment instead of looking at them from a distance, that i couldn't yet swim being 2 didn't matter to me.
sometimes being a bit impertinent and reckless, loved doing parodies if i felt that something was ridiculous (which very angered my teacher in elementary school because I even did them during class).
actually fought with the boys in my class in breaks instead of just enjoying being chased around by them as opposed to all the other girls just giggling and be girly like. in return they let me play football ( soccer) with them as the only girl in both teams.
protected a boy in my class no-one liked, they threw his clothes into the girls changing room after swimming class and i was the only one being appalled by such behaviour, took them, marched over to him, gave them back and yelled at these idiots for being insensitive idiots. that's been also the first time when i thought that the others all just were a bunch of hypocritical asses, because even those who judged my parodies negatively because you just don't do that( norms, weird perceptions of what's allowed to do and no go's in society, *sigh) laughed their asses off at the expense of this lonely, shy boy.
even though i was a very active and demanding child, i needed alone time and the quiet, spending it with drawing or playing nintendo games.
at the age of 3 my parents decided that i should learn to dance, maybe because i was too active? don't know for sure.
so i wound up dancing competitively solo for 18 years, but despite training 2 to 3 hours per day, i took riding lessons, played football with the boys, in my teens i even jogged 15 km AFTER my daily dance training of 3 to 4 hours then.
sounds insane and it was.

then at the age of 10 something happened that turned my world and myself upside down.
had high fever for about 2 weeks, nearly died, had visions of angels and such like.
so after that, i was diagnosed with hashimotos syndrome, which blessed me with severe brain fog, anxiety, not being able to concentrate for long, a depressed state of mind/feeling and and and.
additionally my father chose to be an alcoholic and made my teenage life more miserable by shouting at me, telling me that i would never accomplish anything besides many other niceties.
only now, nearly 32, i found a way to selfmedicate and lift the brain fog, being depressed, the anxiety.
after years of no contact my father stopped drinking a few years ago.
im finding my way more and more back to my true self, but for me it's not going back but forward.

sorry that it's gotten so long, im a bit feely right now and had to get it off my chest.
so what do you think?

ESFP,"Hi! Female INTP here.

I‚Äôm in need of advice. I‚Äôve been working closely with an ESFP for more than 15 years. Of everyone on our team, she‚Äôs the one who I‚Äôve never been able to click with. It makes me sad because I admire her and hate feeling tension around other people.

We‚Äôre a similar age, and met in our mid teens (both early 30s now). 

All I want is to understand how to interact with her. But it seems like every time I see her she shows a new face. Some weeks she‚Äôll seem eager to talk and be friends, other times I feel like I‚Äôm being bullied and ignored in favour of the cool kids. Some weeks she‚Äôll be aggressively show-offy; other weeks I can tell her walls have lowered and she wants emotional support or connection.

I am sure that she‚Äôs deeply sensitive. She had issues with her weight and looks growing up which she‚Äôs overcome but still seem triggering to her. She can get really angry at work superiors, but it‚Äôs usually when she feels an injustice. It hurts me to witness that, because it seems like she ignores other people‚Äôs feelings and just assumes the worst in their motivations. I wonder if that‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening between her and me.

This sounds cocky, but I do wonder sometimes if part of our issue is that she‚Äôs jealous. If she feels like we‚Äôre getting too equal, it‚Äôs like she has to lash out and destroy the equilibrium again.

In the past she‚Äôs been nicest to me when I‚Äôve expressed genuine admiration of her. But she seems to have an internal idea of exactly how much praise she requires, because too much or too little and she‚Äôs back to being mistrusting of me.

Do any of you identify with this? How can I find a way of working together that doesn‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm being gaslighted half the time? Quitting isn‚Äôt an option- it‚Äôs our dream job. I don‚Äôt care if we‚Äôre friends or enemies or have an unspoken agreement to not talk unless our job requires us to.... it‚Äôs the not knowing that is hard.  

I‚Äôm willing to say what I‚Äôve just written to her... but I just have zero idea if it would help or hurt.

I would argue ESFPs are way more misunderstood especially in MBTI. IRL too, people assume we're dumb because we're happy.

Hi! I‚Äôm a student from Seneca College doing a small research study for my major on the connection between personality and the amount of text that people post online. If you have a few minutes to fill out this survey (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdECFEzijDjqQAM4swbns4rWZM6mG38xFKZjoJpsUnVED_ThA/viewform?usp=sf_link) I would be very grateful! NO personal information is requested.

The survey is a Big Five inventory that will give me some personality information. I ask for your username so I can run it through Reddit‚Äôs API in Python to get your comment history, but after associating it with your score I will DELETE YOUR USERNAME and will NOT use it in any way in connection with your comment history. I am also only going to look at usage information from a distance, like how many comments you have over what time period and how many words you average per comment. The reason I need your username is so I can connect a score to a comment history so I can look at that meta-information, but everything will be kept totally anonymous!

My goal for now is just to look at correlations, but maybe I could eventually build this out into a cool analyzer tool like this: https://atomiks.github.io/reddit-user-analyser/

ESFP,"I've been seeing my esfp girlfriend for about 2.5 months now. We met through a friend and hit it off right away. We live around 30mins away from each other. I'm a student while she's a flight attendant. For those of you who aren't aware, flight attendants have insanely tough work schedules which can wreck havoc on your sleep and health; plus the physically intensive work and long work hours can be stressful. But she loves her job and seems to have abundant energy always.

The 1st month was great. We'd meet around twice a week (which works out great for both of us considering she gets only 1 day off a week and me being ISTP) and had terrific chemistry. We have similar values and I even had an awesome time with her friends.

The next month was terrible for her. Her work schedule was crazy hectic, she lost her credit card and had to shift to a new place. As I was busy with classes during the day and the only free time she had was spent by her running from place to place to sort things out, we had absolutely no way of seeing each other. She had night shifts, day shifts all over the place and things were chaotic. I tried to supportive throughout asking if she needed any help with things. My texts and calls would often go unanswered, and I had no way of knowing how she was doing. She'd get back to me at times and tell me about how exhausted she was and that she'd see me soon but well, I haven't seen her in a month now. Due to the crazy communication breakdown happening (no texts and calls from her side; I'd initiate contact always now, and she'd respond very rarely), I was losing my patience and said I needed a break from things if communication was going to be one sided like this. I wanted to be there for her and help her out but she just seemed to shut me out completely from her life. She got back to me once saying she wasn't ignoring me but it was because of work and her issues that she hasn't been able to talk. I still can't understand how that's an excuse to not be able to drop a one-line text reply a day. 

There have been days when she wouldn't take calls at all and just disappear from the face of the earth only to get back to me 2 days later. The last text I sent her, she didn't respond at all for 4 days. I just left her a text afterwards saying that she didn't have to do everything alone and that I was here for her to open up to. I just reassured her that I cared for her and she just needed to reach out. I haven't heard from her in 2 weeks now.

I've done every bit to try and be supportive but she just seems not want any of it. I don't know if she's in an Ni grip kinda situation or if she's ghosting me, but I've decided to fade out of this. If she reaches out to me, we can talk this through. Otherwise I'm done.

Do ESFPs always shut down like this under stress? Is it because of aux Fi? My friend through whom I met her says she has always tried to project an image where she wants everyone to think she's got all under control even when there's a crisis inside of her.

Hello. *waves awkwardly* I'm an INFP. I don't belong here, but I seriously need help so whoop here I is. 

I've known an ESFP for 3 years now and I adore her more than I've ever loved anyone. She's nothing like the narcissistic, elusive, party-clown stereotype you'd read about on a tumblr description. We were always drawn to each other but were basically strangers. Then over a month ago she broke down crying in an emotional moment and I was the one that held her. I'm still the one that holds her. We've texted every single day since then and haven't broken the streak, plus we volunteer at the same facility so I see her up to three times a week. In the beginning it was quite like the rush of burying deeper in depth, holding your breath in anticipation of what's under the waves. She would text me the second she'd wake up and we'd talk and laugh until she fell asleep. She'd visit me at work and I'd bring her gifts to her work. We clicked on all the things we had in common and were amazed by our differences. She laughed at mah sick memes, would constantly say she loved me. 

Now it's just not the same. She still texts me when she wakes up everyday but the conversation fizzles long before the afternoon, and I'm usually the one trying to chase the spark. She doesn't visit me anymore, or care what I think about things, doesn't laugh at my jokes as much, rarely says I love you. I feel annoying and worthless, I fear I'm losing her.

 In person, the last time I saw her I held her as she cried again, but that doesn't mean we really click when we talk. Mostly we just vibe. I'm very boring when we're not working on something or listening to her play music. I'm two years older, so maybe she sees me as a

He asked to hangout last weekend and we did. We had sooooo much fun. Went to a food festival, watched a movie, hung out with his group of friends at a resteraunt and drank. They all wanted to go to the bar afterwards but he just wanted to stay home to hook up. We ended up doing so. In the morning he dropped me off at home. We talked a bit but hes usually always out doing something so hes barley on his phone ever. He messaged me a few days later and asked what I was doing on Saturday, i said ""why, you wanna do something?"" He was like ""yeah well i do owe you a kiss"". So we ended up hanging out on the Saturday and of course, was an amazing time. We flirted constantly, he kissed me so passionately, we hooked up a few times, he stares at me, puts his hands through my hair, cuddled me all night. Told me he could make out with me all day. I said i was hungry and he said we'll go for breakfast and then he'll drop me off. Hes very affectionate but he has told me that hes never had a girlfriend before, never been inlove. He said its partly because he was shy and nerdy as a teenager and partly because he doesn't want his freedom revoked. I can see myself wanting to be with him in the future but idk if he feels what I feel, or wants to just hook up and have fun. I cant even remember how it got brung up but i said something,  and he was like ""You think i dont like you?"" And he had like a sad look on his face almost, maybe offended or turned off, not sure,  but i started becoming unclear and said well obviously you like me but like like me i mean idk, yoyou're kind of a player. He just smiled and started to kiss me and stuff which gave me the vibe that he just wanted me to shut up and hook up. Not even sure lol, i really like him and hes so fun and wild, always down to do anything, very affectionate and sweet.",1499056510

ESFP,"So I met my colleague when I started my new job about a year ago. We became friends quickly, although we took longer to become close friends. I'm ENFP, he's ESFP. Basically we started hooking up together really gradually - probably a bad idea because we work together, but it seems to suit us. He always told me he doesn't want a relationship, and I've never tried to change his mind on this. But recently, he's been ignoring me a little bit and acting withdrawn, as if our friendship doesn't matter to him, when it's always seemed to matter hugely in the past. He's always been really private, so I know there's no point asking him to explain what's going on. But basically, I don't understand why it is he doesn't want a relationship when we get on so well as friends as well as, y'know, the other stuff. Also, why the brush-off? Am I just too needy? Wondering if I should just break it off... Jeez. I wasn't expecting to get upset over all this, but well, I actually kind of am. Any advice or potential explanations very welcome.  ",1497121865
ESFP,"Hey there, hope you don't mind me attempting to pick your brains for a minute - I got good participation levels from other MBTI groups so I thought I'd extend it to all groups and try to get a more representative sample. FYI - the study is not collecting personality type information.

My dissertation for my masters in psychology is looking into one possible explanation for avoidance behaviours in forming intimate relationships. If you are 20-35yo and keen to contribute to my study then you can do so by following the link below. Any questions give me a shout, also I'm happy to discuss and hear your thoughts on the subject off the record if you want! It should't take too long but you're free to stop at any point anyway. It may cause some emotional distress as it involves some self evaluation so if you experience any discomfort and would like some guidance please get in touch.

I will leave the survey open until the end of this week.

ESFP,"Kinda a weird thing to ask, I guess, but I wanted to see what like minded people's responses would be!

Anger, more often than not, is marked down with negative societal connotations. It's seen as irrational, unnecessary and generally a bit shit. 

I have always used anger as a focus point. Making the connotations a bit more muddy, for me - as in they're not wholly negative. Anything that made me feel unsure or insecure - anxiousness, indecision, confusion, uncertainty - I've funnelled into anger, as in the past I wasn't quite equipped with the mental patience to properly deal with those separate emotions individually.

Now this doesn't mean that every time I felt these things, I would break out in a blind fury and release the beast within. It's actually the opposite. I used it to focus myself. I used anger to motivate myself and spur myself into action to eradicate the source these feelings. 

Hell, I even used it get through my high school exams.

I definitely am not the only person in the world who feels that anger isn't a wholly negative emotion - that you can manipulate that vigour to benefit yourself. 

Brings me to ask, what is anger to you? How do you experience anger?

ESFP,"Ok, so I'm an INFP (I know one of those lol). Anyways, I recently reconnected with some guy who I share a mutual friend with. We hung out in group settings and flirted/talked a couple times a while ago. Then it led to this. 

So, we've been ""seeing each other"" for around 3 weeks now. Probably hung out around 4 or 5 times. The dates weren't really traditional though, which i get since ESFP's prefer ""doing things."" I'm confused though. We did sleep together the second time, he tried the first date but I didn't want to. I've come to see he's just a really physically affectionate person, and he's said that too. 

The thing I don't get is what's going on I guess? I know 3 weeks is short and I'm probably overthinking. It's just when we hang out it's so great and it feels like we're so connected. He alludes to doing things with and for me in the future. He seems to genuinely care, but gets kind personal and pushy with questions tbh. But overall I would think he likes me?? But, in between we hardly talk. He would take hours to answer texts, which I think is normal for him. But still. Now, I haven't talked to him for like 5 days. Almost a week. The last time I talked to him he responded quicker which was weird. Anyways, not important. 

What I want to know is should I just try and be more casual? Do you think it'd be better if I back off and let him chase me more. Or would he take it as a sign I'm not interested. I don't think so but still. I'm just confused and don't want to scare him off. I'm ok with taking things as they are I just don't want to trust him if he's not interested. Deep down I feel like I know he is but I just don't know for how long.

I know this is long and probably really dramatic. But any input or advice from the few ESFPs here??

(Note: for this summary, we will be using the term ""[extravert](https://www.mrexcel.com/forum/excel-questions/808744-exporting-chart-via-visual-basic-applications-sometimes-gives-empty-file.html)"" as used in clinical analysis initiated by Carl Jung instead of the popularized spelling, ""extrovert."" )

# Introduction

The Movers &amp; Makers company is engaged in ongoing research about introverts, extraverts, age, occupation, and communication preferences. The original hypothesis was that introverts, or individuals in introvert-friendly occupations such as STEM, were more adverse to having a phone call disrupt their time, with some exceptions. In contrast, extraverts, or individuals in extravert-friendly occupations, were more open to phone calls. Our formal interviews showed this hypothesis to be incorrect and revealed a trend based more on age and occupation than temperament.

As an informal triangulation of our data, The Movers &amp; Makers research team decided to conduct surveys on popular social media and internet forums. The research has not yet concluded, but ""Phase 1"" of these informal surveys are complete and we'd like to share the results of these surveys. The results of this informal survey coincided with our formal research and also contradicted the original hypothesis. This summary is not an analysis of our hypothesis, our formal research, or of the informal research. This summary is only a brief overview of the informal survey results.

# Summary

In addition to essential demographic questions, the questions of the survey took the form of ""I work for a company that has never done business with you and I'd like to introduce myself."" The possible answers included, ""Call your phone number,"" ""Send you an email,"" ""Send you an SMS,"" ""Send you an MMS,"" and ""Send you an IM."" We also asked two, somewhat open-ended questions that emphasized the positive and negative consequences of the communication preferences.

## Overall Preferences

Our initial observations, which initiated our research, were that there are some people that don't like to be called on the phone and would prefer to be contacted by other means. This survey supported the observation with less than a third of respondents preferring  a phone call (31.3%) over alternative methods. Email was the preferred method by half of the respondents (49.6%).

[Overall Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/UmRoBq3)

Granted, the spectrum of scenarios may have been biased toward phone-call-aversion, so this is not an absolute reflection of preferences, but merely a summary of the preferences reflected in this survey. 

### Introvert-Extravert Preferences

Breaking down the data between introverts and extraverts yielded an insignificant difference between the two temperaments. Introverts preferred a phone call in 30.61% of responses. Extraverts preferred a phone call in 31.41% of responses. This is a difference of only 0.8% and is much smaller than we anticipated.

[Introvert Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/p7S4Djk)

[Extravert Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/9eww0um)

The similarities between introvert and extravert coincide with our formal research and are also reflected in the breakdown of most of each questions that follow.

#### Ambivert Preferences

While ""ambivert"" is not a part of some personality/temperament models, many contemporary research make allowances for ambiverts. In our case, we are including the term because people that identify as ambiverts seem themselves as distinct from both extraverts and introverts and they may have a distinct profile. However, the number of respondents describing themselves as Ambiverts is too small to comprehensively study and we recommend a more in-depth study of ambiverts and communication preferences.  Still, as a note of interest, we'll include the results here, though we caution against drawing any conclusions. Ambiverts responded with a preference for email at 54.6% and phone calls at 19.2%.

[Ambivert Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/5CHYPha)

### Male-Female Preferences

Our original hypothesis did not account for sex or gender. We allowed for the selection of ""sex"" in the survey to satisfy any curiosity of biological temperament selection. As we suspected, there isn't a large or significant difference in correlation of sex to communication preferences as borne out in our formal research and reflected in these survey results.

[Male Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/VeC5EeV)

Overall, male respondents selected a preference for a phone call in 34% of responses with females selecting phone calls in only 28.6% of responses. Email was the preferred response for both males and females in 49.3% and 49.7% of responses respectively.

[Female Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/Npq6ZeS)

#### Gender and Non-traditional Genders

We specifically did not include the word ""gender"" in this survey because the study of gender is outside of the scope of our current research. We allowed for the answers of ""Prefer not to say,"" and ""Other"" with an open field to promote the completion of the survey, but this survey is not equipped to tackle gender. Even with this allowance, only 0.1% of respondents answered with a non-traditional sex. Of that 0.1%, some of the respondents showed open hostility to the survey in their comments, indicating that this answer was not truly reflective of the respondent. The answers from these respondents were removed from our analyzed results.

That does not mean, however, that we do not value research regarding gender. We believe that the identification of gender and that correlation to communication preference might be quite significant. It is simply that we have not begun to tackle the question at this time. We would openly welcome input or recommendations from anyone with knowledge or expertise in this area.

### Generational Preferences

The first of two areas with distinctive responses is the difference in generation. The age groups that we call ""Millennials"" are the least resistant to phone calls, with 31.6% of responses, and yet 48.4% of the Millennial responses prefer email. Millennials were also more open to ""alternative"" communication methods such as IM, SMS, etc. with about 20% of the responses in total.

[Millennial Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/fJBFPKj)

The age groups that we call ""Generation X,"" or ""Gen X,"" are slightly more resistant to phone calls with only 29.1% of responses preferring a phone call and 57.3% preferring email.

[Gen X Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/mAotSZr)

The age groups that we call ""Baby Boomers,"" or just ""Boomers"" are the most resistant to phone calls with only 23.6% of responses preferring a phone call and 72.7% preferring email. Boomers were the most resistant to ""alternative"" communication methods with only 3.6% of responses for SMS and zero responses for the other methods.

[Boomer Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/U7Yng1Z)

### Occupational Preferences

The second of two areas with distinctive responses is the difference in occupation, or, occupational ""wings"" as we call them. These wings are simply divided into occupations that are [STEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics)-related and non-STEM-related. The survey results reinforced our formal research and part of our hypothesis that respondents in STEM-related fields are more resistant to phone calls than their non-STEM peers. Respondents in STEM-related fields responded with 23.5% of responses preferring phone calls and 57.4% preferring email.  

[STEM-Related Occupation Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/QnwxZOc)

Responses in non-STEM-related occupations were more receptive to phone calls, but only with 34.2% of the responses and 46.7% preferring email.

[non-STEM-Related Occupation Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/LMluzrF)

## Scenario Preferences

We asked respondents to imagine a range of hypothetical scenarios and how they'd prefer to be contacted in those scenarios. The scenarios spanned a variety of business-oriented communications that fall onto a spectrum what we term ""cold to hot"" in order indicate the amount of familiarity the two parties have already established. We also asked about preferences in various degrees of urgency and responsibility.

It is probably unsurprising that the more distant and less urgent relationships are the most resistant to phone calls and the nearest and more urgent relationships are the most receptive to phone calls. In the ""coldest"" scenario, *I work for a company that has never done business with you and I'd like to introduce myself*, responses were predictably low on preferring a phone call with only 8% of responses and 85% preferring email. In this scenario, the differences between introvert and extravert were negligible, but the differences in generation were in-line with the overall responses. STEM and non-STEM responses were also in agreement with the overall responses.

[Cold Business Introduction Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/65J1a3r)

Also, predictably, the ""hottest"" scenario, *I have an emergency (business emergency, not life or death)*, included 74.6% of responses favoring a phone call and 5.9% preferring email. As an interesting note, in this scenario, more respondents preferred SMS to email with 13.7% of the responses.

[Emergency Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/IOxd25R)

The scenarios that emphasized cool or hot combined with responsibility, however, were a little surprising. For the scenario, *I'm a customer with a question (it's your responsibility to answer customer questions),* the responses were similar to the warm business responses. 19% of responses preferred a phone call for customer questions and 72.2% of responses preferred email.

[Cool Customer Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/2FOARrW)

The scenario, *I'm a customer with a problem (it's your responsibility to handle customer problems),* showed a surprising 61% preferring email and only 31.2% preferring a phone call.

[Hot Customer Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/FbwgWnW)

## Consequences

We were also interested in understanding what impact these preferences have on the communication recipient. We set up a pair of questions in the survey to give respondents a chance to demonstrate the perceived consequences, both positive and negative. The negative consequences include, ""I mostly roll with it--no big deal"" (16.8%), ""I find it irritating and frustrating"" (24.3%), and ""The interruption negatively affects my work"" (16.5%), as well as, ""I may decide not to reply or continue communication"" (17.8%). The most damaging consequences would be ""I lose some respect for the person contacting me"" (7.3%), and ""I may block that person, or mark their contact as 'spam' or 'junk'"" (6.5%).

[Negative Consequences Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/RbL1A2Q)

Conversely, when the respondents' preferences were respected, there were positive consequences, including, ""It helps me manage my schedule"" (14.3%), ""I feel I'm more productive and efficient"" (13.9%), ""I believe I can dedicate the proper amount of attention to the communication"" (21.5%), ""I'm less irritated"" (20%), and ""It reduces my anxiety"" (18.8%).

# Conclusion

Our initial observations were that most people don't like receiving phone calls. Perhaps it's no mystery that the manner in which communication technology evolved puts the telephone front-and-center to business communication. However, our ongoing research shows that most people find phone calls to be disruptive and intrusive. Using the phone as a primary source of communication could be damaging to business relationships and to the overall economic health of our collective society. 

Looking at this research, we can see why ""cold calling"" feels ineffective and like ""a waste of time"" to many people. ""Cold emails"" are more likely to be effective and seem to have a lower downside. In fields like recruiting, it may be damaging for the hiring side of the relationship to initiate contact with a phone call. 

Yes, the research is ongoing, but it seems relatively clear that the phone should not be the first point of contact in any scenario, unless we know for certain that the recipient would prefer a phone call or we know for certain that the purpose of the contact is an emergency (the definition of ""emergency"" is somewhat subjective and needs to be judiciously applied). In business scenarios, the least risky option for contacting anyone is to use email and the most risky is to use alternative methods like MMS, or even IM. But, phone calls seem equally risky by the same standards considering that email seemed to dominate the responses.

As an illustration of the resistance to phone calls, this is a comment from the survey, ""I hate phone calls, almost unconditionally.  Texting or e-mails are always preferable unless it's really an emergency."" And, another comment, ""I do not generally like speaking on the phone because it's a purely auditory activity, and I am a visual person... I like time to process what's going on and formulate a response, otherwise I feel flustered and anxious."" These and several other comments are reflective of the overall tone of this survey. There were no equivalent comments showing resistance to email. 

Our research currently only analyzes the state of things as they are, not *why* things are as they are. For example, why are Boomers more resistant to phone calls than Millennials? Why are STEM-related occupations more resistant to phone calls than non-STEM-related fields? Why are extraverts as equally resistant to phone calls as introverts? What is the significance of gender in communication preference? How might this study be different if we focused on personal scenarios instead of business scenarios?

All of these questions push us to recommend further research in this area. We know that we are continuing to research this area, but our small contribution covers only a fraction of needed research.

We will begin ""Phase 2"" of this research soon. If you're interested in participating, keep a watch on our blog for updates. This topic will remain a topic of interest for The Movers &amp; Makers Company and our research is ongoing.
