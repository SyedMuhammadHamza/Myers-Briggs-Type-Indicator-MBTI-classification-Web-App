isfp,I really feel that last part you said. Due to the nature of conversations I have with people plus the whole class clown approach I take I get a lot of people that think I‚Äôm not a nice person (not necessarily in a bad way) when in fact I‚Äôm actually a super caring and super nice person that just likes to play around and roast others. When I find a person that‚Äôs willing to go back and forth like that with me but at heart we both know we aren‚Äôt being serious it can honestly be really fun and that‚Äôs the type of person I usually find myself falling in love with.,1617465749
isfp,"I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just the fact that I don‚Äôt do many social interactions that I‚Äôm not comfortable with, but I never experience that need for a recharge.

I think most of my introverted nature comes from emotional abuse as a child. Essentially my conscious is always telling me stuff like ‚Äúhey this person doesn‚Äôt want to be bothered by you‚Äù or ‚Äúhey you‚Äôre not worth this persons time.‚Äù",1617465541
isfp,"I honestly think the biggest thing about changing is that my personality seems to adapt to my surroundings. Last year when I took the test I was working only morning shifts, usually by myself or with one other person in my zone and the restaurant was filled with only adults (25-30+) where as I‚Äôm a 19 year old. I also took many classes that didn‚Äôt encourage class interaction. I feel that‚Äôs a big reason for me being an INTP when I took the test.

About 8 months ago I switched to working night shifts with a ton of kids who were either my age or like 2 years younger than me. My energy changed completely.

I think this just shows what I‚Äôve read about ISFPs being paradoxical. I think at heart I‚Äôm a spontaneous but introverted person. However, I adapt to situations really well and can come off as someone who always thinks before they act as well instead of being spontaneous. Like I said in my post I was a class clown in high school and had a ton of loose friendships and only a few real friends and right now I‚Äôm a very entertaining person in a comfortable setting. I think the problem was just that year and a half stretch I really became an INTP.",1617465390
isfp,"I think writing could be a good way to develop Ni. It would produce as lot of useless information, but maybe looking at it all will bring out strong feelings about the truth of a situation. I used to write when I was really upset, and externalising my thoughts made it clear in which way I was being stupid, to be frank. Maybe it's also just that some thoughts are so irrational, that seeing it written turns on the bullshit-filter.",1617464187
isfp,"Listening to yourself and the 'feelings' Ni brings up. Because the feelings arise at random mostly, you have to constantly be aware of your inner conclusions that have no easily explainable reasons. That is Ni. If your start relying on what these feelings are telling you instead of questioning it, it will eventually come more naturally to you. 

Dreams are just dreams, I think. You can dream up good ideas, but a developed Ni will help you function more confidently and efficiently in your everyday life.",1617463835

You can cut a lot of corners and be efficient in your decision-making, if you just go with your gut, which is how I see Ni. I just KNOW when something feels right. When I was younger I questioned my intuition and used so much energy trying to back up my feelings with logic, but fact is that some issues are so complex that you will only fuck up if you think you can rely on the few things that are logically deducible.

isfp,"Ah cool!

So I think that ""communal value expression"" rejection idea I mentioned is naturally derived from Fi. The reason is because Fi finds externalization of emotions to be the wrong method, just as Fe thinks that the internalization of emotions is the wrong method. That's not to say that I can't find Fe to be proper and Fe users can't find Fi to be appropriate, but rather that we are biologically engineered to naturally view it one way or the other and that they are oriented very differently. 

The simplified mob mentality scenario is not limited to Fe, but it can often be attributed to Fe by Fi. This can sometimes happen bc we start to see Fe as superficial or trendy and not acknowledge that it, in it's own way, is being authentic to itself in trying to empathize with others. I agree with you that many Fi users can be cringy snots and that many Fe users can be authentic and true to themselves. I know better than many too since my SO is an ISFJ üòâ.

&gt;was some self-righteous correction

Haha never, I enjoy discussion! I still hold to the idea that Fi finds communal value expression somewhat unnatural/distasteful though, but in a theoretically based way, not in a personally biased way. :P I was a little strapped for time when responding to this so I hope I didn't miss anything haha.

isfp,"You are like a ""friend"" of mine (a girl) and also a little like me.
She likes to flirt while remaining mysterious, but she fear approaches because she knows that when they get to know her, she is different from the person she happear to be externally.

I noticed a lot of ISFPs do this. Externally they behave like the person they envision to be, but they fear to be ""discovered"". They use distance like a tool.

This girl liked me, I liked her, but she couldn't stand the fact that with me she was kinda weird because shyness maybe (and so, with me she wasn't like she felt to be). To me there wasn't a problem in it, but she fear I would stop thinking she is mysterious and strong. Ironically this brings her to stay alone.

I'm similiar to you too. I discovered I'm not so good at being ""bad ass"" when you met me, so it ends I'm starting to prefer flirting for the sake of it (also, I get mistyped INTJ for years).",1617441171

isfp,"Hey this happens to me irl exclusively!

Would you agree the motive behind rejecting ""Fe opinions"" is normally some form of ""If these people seem to be collectively adhering to something that is not ok (so uniformly and without even thinking about it), and seem to be doing it purely for the sake of imitation, when it is obviously unfair and it's not something they feel, I feel the need to make it clear I don't endorse any of this, and to find out why this widespread attitude is not justified / factually wrong"". It's some sort of anti-witchunt / anti careless mob instinct, so to speak.

I just think it's aversion to lack of authenticity, not something against Fe. I always feel ENFJs or ISFJs are super authentic when expressing abstract ethical judgements/opinions or expressing personal feelings. When people are ""faking it to get something"" I hate my guts out of it, regardless of their Fe / Fi orientation. I've seen some other infps being super disgusting, and intjs are just ew sometimes (now I think about it, when ENFJs are being flattering and idealizing people and offputting in that they seem to be consciously manipulating people, at least they seem genuine about wanting the other person to like them. But sometimes Fi users just seem morbidly fascinated with themselves, or at least show it more, and I feel the need to distance from them/reject them because they're doing things ""the wrong way, for the wrong reasons"" and in my eyes stand for ""the bad approach to being individualistic"" and ""might discredit autonomy"" (which is an odd thing to think - I don't think it's good Fi, and seems more like an obnoxious/intruding thing coming from undeveloped Fe). It used to happen a lot on highschool, and I don't think one'd think that say when one is not overwhelmed / feels able to respond better.",1617439239
isfp,Yeah that was what I was thinking. Thanks‚ò∫Ô∏è,1617437153
isfp,"Well, in my opinion, INFJ and ISFJ are the most extraverted introvert type, because they believe in the people the most. INFJ has such ideas, and they can express themselves, that they can become so popular in a group. There are much similarities between INFJ and ENFJ. Maybe the only difference is INFJ doesn't want to be a leader of a group, but they could do anything for their ideas.

It's important to know that a result of an MBTI test is your current personality type. But it can be changed during the years, under happenings and people you meet. But the most important is: Do you want to change? As I read, you wanted to change, this is why, you became extraverted than earlier. So, I believe that even personality type can change.",1617436980

It's usually more of an irl thing though for me, as I'm not affected as much by what online communities think. 

The idea of rejecting communal value expression is definitely Fi based. The more Fe something feels the less you want to associate yourself with it. When unchecked it can get to the point where you only like things simply due to the fact that others don't and it makes you seem more individualistic. Nothing wrong with individualism, but by itself it can be pretty empty. (Not relating that to you, just speaking in general! :P ).

I totally get what you mean. Many people ask for the truth thinking that they can handle it, but they don't realize that they're not ready for it (that sounded pretentious coming out üòÇ)and that their reaction to it might very well make things worse between them!  That's why wisdom is such an important thing to try to attain, it pulls everything together in ways that mutually benefit and not destroy and can harmonize ideas to the situations and feelings being experienced real-time. Unfortunately many times I prefer harmony over promoting understanding (bc it can be painful) which makes the wisdom I try to use lose much of it's power haha since there is an ulterior motive. 

Lying is so commonplace nowadays(I hate it), unfortunately, so I think that's honestly amazing that you have an easy time being so transparent! I have no idea how that feels! Since I try to not lie nor be transparent there's just a lot of awkward silence. üôÉ My aunt said once, ""When you lie you have to remember who you lied to and what the lie was and keep track of that with all of the other people and lies involved. It's too much work."" I honestly feel bad for pathological liars. I think it's one of the most destructive and isolating habits someone can have, and it almost never ends well. I met one once. Dude could lie about the weather, I had to drop that friendship at that point. 

&gt;power plays

&gt;insecurity

Truth. Both of these frustrate me. What's sad is how obvious it is in the person doing it but they don't see it themselves sometimes. So many adults seem like overgrown children sometimes bc of their lack of understanding (I'm sounding pretentious again üòÇ). My life has been vexed by people negatively affecting me in the form of mild emotional abuse due to adherence to over-simplified cultural norms and a lack of personal emotional development. For example, ""Real men/women do X, Y, Z! You must be a ___(insert sexual orientation related insult here)."" That's a small example. I've always tried to be fiercely  independent and resist classifying myself and others with norms, but it hurts when there are so many people who have literally no problem at all loudly and proudly heckling you with trashy words bc they are being small minded and ignorant. I walk it off, sure, but it baffles me how self-assured they are in complete nonsense. Sorry, I went off on a tangent too :P

See, I agree with the idea that a person desiring to be good needs to have an understanding of evil. Without an understanding of evil, the good you are espousing doesn't carry weight. It's like a feel-good trend whose only purpose is to continue rather than an insightful worldview whose intention is to protect and unify with truth. It doesn't usually have backbone and conviction. Carl Jung himself (speculated to be INFJ) said, ""Everyone carries a shadow, and the less it is embodied in the individual's conscious life, the blacker and denser it is."" While shadow=/=evil, the idea that our personal darknesses can want to lash out in evil ways is a good addition to this idea. I don't necessarily think that we should ever practice evil, but rather that we should be aware of it's presence and humanity's tendency towards it. Without that we are open to a false sense of confidence that we won't slip in a big way. That's never good to have.

Sounds like a very slow, painful and idealistic crawl. üòî You have my respect for your level of endurance!

My mother's Ne drove me insane for most of my life and it's really molded my current lack of patience with her haha. It was always this willingness to make me engage in things that I was uncomfortable with and a complete lack of awareness to the fact that I did not want to do it lol. Then when things went poorly she'd whine and act all innocent . üò§

Yeah Ne man, haha. It can be so talkative and all over the place.

&gt;Is it like that with for you too?

Not for me at least! My Se has always been good at adapting to my environment and being able to take everything in. Maybe it's lower Se being overwhelmed.ü§î 

&gt;I watched this video.

Yayyyy ü•≥

Haha I know what you mean. I think the lack of talking and the emotionality without verbal expression can really give us an air of grace at times if we want to come off that way. I think you and Michael Pierce would get along haha, in his book, ""Motes and Beams: A Neo-Jungian Theory of Personality"" (highly recommend, 10/10) he describes ISFPs similarly to you (graceful, embodiment of the beauty of values). While we can be this way, time has a way of wearing down the soul at times so it's not always a guarantee haha. 

&gt;Uncomplicated and simplicity, stark constrast to all the posturing and bs that takes place in the world.

I vibe with that! Let everyone live their own lives in peace and be decent, honest and sincere with one another, y'know? That's awesome that you vibe to that too man! ü§ú Haha we appreciate you bro, most INFJs need protecting at all costs too : ) 

&gt;But feelings give it away. My Ni lands on the right answer like 80% of the time.

It's actually pretty cool bc I was reading Michael's book just recently, in the INFJ section and he describes the same thing. You guys have an almost unnatural ability to accurately identify multiple things at once while still having a heart that strives to reach humanity. To be able to do all that and still love other people is crazy talented! I have a very close INFJ family member who has always done his best to warn and protect his loved ones from bad influences and has been walked all over many times by the same ppl he's trying to protect. It's sad, but very honorable and I love him for it(I've defended him many times and consoled him through the years, his loved ones are braindead üòÇüòî). You guys have an amazing sense of duty to others, and it's really cool to see it lived out! 

&gt;My mind tonight is so tired, due to lot of travelling today whole day,

Oh dang dude lol, get your rest! Don't worry about the filter, I'm great with walls of text and I'm equally guilty loool. Tbh, its just nice having Ni based talks dealing with emotions and personality, I totally vibe with it bro. Definitely not vomit!

It's very curious how what was more ""Fi"" in the past has become more ""Fe"" now.

Like scientist who discovered rules of nature which now take part in science books (Ti-Te metaphor).

While I'm very different. I don't like the idea of the occasional sex for exemple because

- I feel my being to not be this. ""If I do this thing I will not be myself anymore, I can't do it.""

- I feel too much special/superior to do it with a random person;

- I try to don't use others in ""trying things""; my greatest fear it's to make others feel bad for my choices, so I prefer to reduce errors wich involve others.

Most ESTJs I know are the opposite of lazy and happily do what needs to be done (MAYBE sometimes complaining about the lazy people around them who don‚Äôt wanna do what they‚Äôre supposed to) but I haven‚Äôt seen any of them just ordering people around without doing anything themselves. I always see them as such disciplined, action-oriented people, so maybe her issues don‚Äôt have that much to do with her personality type? (I could also see those traits more in an ISTJ possibly)",1617396256
isfp,I might think someone‚Äôs crazy for the way they think or the things they believe but I don‚Äôt expect them to go according to my own values at all because I very much respect each persons autonomy and independence in thought and action. The only time I might care is if they ask me my opinion about something and then completely disregard what I said. Like don‚Äôt ask me if you‚Äôre not actually interested. I‚Äôm not usually jealous if people get attention for the beliefs I disagree with as long as they‚Äôre not imposing those beliefs on me or expecting me to go along with them.,1617395948
isfp,"Ya infjs are the greatest at reading people but probably one of the hardest TO read. 

And ya that makes sense my dad did a lot of the work too as he‚Äôs an istp but my narcissistic estj mother? Absolutely nothingüòÇjust told us what work she wanted US to do",1617395861
isfp,"One thing that helped me with conflict on all fronts is the book Radical Candor. I manage an art store, and when I started 5 years ago it was a really toxic environment. I was a store clerk and it was terrible. Everyone who was ever hired only wanted to do a good job (artists be idealistic like that) and we‚Äôre constantly being put down. The boss at the time was cruel and shitty but fortunately quit a few months after I started. I started managing 3 1/2 years ago and my only focus was to get the staff in harmony.

The book starts with the assumption that most managers (the ones that aren‚Äôt aggressive and obnoxious) err on the side of being too soft and avoiding honest feedback out of that fear of conflict, and the 2 things that have really helped me push through that were the phrases ‚Äúit‚Äôs not mean, it‚Äôs clear‚Äù and ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt tell someone that what they‚Äôre doing needs to change, then in the end you‚Äôll probably have to end up firing them and that‚Äôs not actually nice at all is it?‚Äù. 

It was really hard because there was a lot of conflict and mistrust when I started but I pushed through and developed the positive minded hardworking staff we have now, and I love working here and managing so much now because I turned it into ‚Äòdeveloping my team and their skills‚Äô instead of punishing them for not knowing what to do. 

Of course you can‚Äôt fire your family or friends, but I think the same lack of directness and clarity was hurting some of my personal relationships and I was very distant with them because of that conflict aversion. It‚Äôs helped me try to get ahead of conflict by being clear about my needs before it‚Äôs an issue. It‚Äôs hard because some of those issues are related to an opposition of values whereas my staff all values working together and doing a good job. Being around family members that lightly engage in conservative conspiracy theories... it‚Äôs been much harder for me to square that circle.",1617395654
isfp,"Yea he‚Äôs the oldest so the responsibility thing was probably even stronger and he is absolutely the most stoic person I know! No one could read him. My ENTP husband had such a hard time figuring him out in the beginning lol

We didn‚Äôt have very many issues with who actually did the work around the house or anything though because my mother is ISFJ so she naturally did pretty much everything herself anyway lol besides for the few things she intentionally gave us to do so we would have ‚Äújobs‚Äù that we were responsible to get done. And she also had very specific expectations of how things should be done so we didn‚Äôt have to think too much about the different possibilities haha",1617395624
isfp,"Ya tbh I think my siblings might just be kinda jerks sometimesüòÇbut definitely in public they avoid conflict, probably even more than I do and infjs hate conflict as well",1617395475
isfp,The variety of patterns you used make it look so unique! I love it :),1617395265
isfp,"Ya omg you sound just like my siblings. My dad would be like ‚Äúok clean up the house‚Äù and for me that‚Äôs simple just clean up all the things I see wrong with the house. My siblings are like ‚Äúok which room? Which items? Do I have to sweep this room? How about this one?‚Äù I mean I don‚Äôt blame u guys thoüòÇand ya your older brother sounds just like me, I‚Äôm sure other infjs can relate too. It‚Äôs like your duty to keep everyone‚Äôs emotions in check because if theirs are bad, it almost hurts you more than it hurts them. You do absolutely everything and don‚Äôt prioritize your well being because they always come first. It‚Äôs an unhealthy infj habit but I think it often forms in families, if one kid is an infj in the family they always end up torturing themselves by trying to make sure everyone stays happy. And ya we honestly don‚Äôt understand how people can‚Äôt control their outbursts because we (especially unhealthy infjs) are so good at regulating our behavior it‚Äôs like a piece of cake. We rarely blow up because we know how to control our outward emotions so well haha. Not really the inside ones but I guess that‚Äôs what happens when you become the emotional collecter lol. Also ya as infjs we can basically understand anyoneüòÇI find it so interesting how just a simple personality type can make people so similar. Like not the same person, but it sounds like me and your brothers brains function like the same exact way, so crazy",1617395142
isfp,I feel like I avoid conflict soo I‚Äôm usually not that moody. But if someones like threatening my ‚Äùfi values‚Äù I feel very annoyed. Maybe your siblings feel that they can express their emotions with you? Cause the closer the person is the better you can show emotions and all that. But yeah if it‚Äôs like bad behaviour you obviously don‚Äôt need to put up with that.,1617394609
isfp,"Yep my older brother is INFJ and always took responsibility for everyone‚Äôs problems, always trying his best to keep the peace and help everyone understand each other and stay calm..

He definitely inspired me a lot but I couldn‚Äôt imagine how he was always so GOOD! 
Btw, I really do like to help out but I need to be given something specific to do and not just be expected to know what needs to be done in general. We don‚Äôt naturally just take responsibility for things unless there‚Äôs no one else to do it. When it‚Äôs just me and i have no choice, I‚Äôm perfectly fine with responsibility.",1617394609
isfp,"Welcome:)

Yup, truth can even be considered optional sometimes. If anyone lies to me, that's something that drives me nuts, but as far as applications go, truth is somewhat optional, sort of. To me, process of lying always feels so cumbersome. Just spitting what I have inside my mind feels so natural and doesn't give me the feeling of unease, like having to lie. On the other hand, some people lie for no reason. They don't need to, but they lie anyways, this honestly surprises me. To me, ideal world is, if we were just able to just directly send thoughts and feelings, directly between minds, so that misunderstandings no longer occur and it just puts an end to the guessing games and power plays. This is far from reality. Because, information is power. LOL. Every person will always tirelessly try to dominate another due to feeling of insecurity. Because of this, even a person wanting to be good, needs to get acquainted with the depths of evil in the world. This will prepare you to recognise the evil in others. And you should be capable of unleashing it yourself in defence when you spot such a person trying to take advantage of you. Some people only understand power...  went too deep into this tangent LOL.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh, my parents still can annoy plenty, they can get stuck in their monologue, and repeat the same thing tirelessly regardless of what you say. But, now I have established boundaries. I have made clear recently the things, in the past that caused me pain. So, in this case, if they accept the responsibility then it's fine, for me, but regardless of their opinions on how to proceed, it hurts more to just leave things like that to me. Fi critic works like that. Even if I win in something, I'll end up apologising lol. This is annoying as hell. And giving up is even worse. So, I'll keep trying to improve things. So, they will improve unwantingly anyways. Because they see that I'm trying. Some sort of balance forms this way. So, it can be seen as like this, if the other person is incapable of handling the situation properly, and if you care for that person, it becomes your responsibility to seize control in that situation until they return to their senses. It can be called something like taking responsibility for both of us. Something like that.

&amp;#x200B;

I watched this video. I felt this was beautiful. But his narration skills could be improved a bit. But that's fine, it can be a subjective thing.  To me honestly, this not expressing themselves, sort of gives of a air of innocence(and they are too for most part I think. Or maybe it's my sample pool), so much that it's unbelievable. I mean, they do trust me naturally. So, when they try to hide something, I feel it's so cute, because, I maybe complete dunce at picking up thoughts(Te blind), and I noticed this as well all the time. But feelings give it away. My Ni lands on the right answer like 80% of the time.  This combined with the calm vibe is just awesome. Uncomplicated and simplicity, stark constrast to all the posturing and bs that takes place in the world. So much communication occurs even in silence I feel. Makes me believe that it's one of those things that should be protected. LOL.

&amp;#x200B;

And as truth, it's always not the case, people think normally that they want honesty, but there is a disconnect in what people think they want, and what people need or can handle. Truth sometimes burns bridges. It's a complicated mess LOL.

&amp;#x200B;

Yeah, Ne. Not only it can be disturbing and completely unrelated to the situation, nagging at you. But I also noticed that Ne people can actually terrorize me by doing all the things that destroy my head, since I am HSP. Loud music, lights etc. For me, if a light source directly shows up in my eyes, I get eye pains and even headaches. Is it like that with for you too?  Another thing, I think, a function(Fi, Ni, Se whatever) in parent slot is more awesome than hero slot. That's what I think. My hypothesis. anyways.

&amp;#x200B;

My mind tonight is so tired, due to lot of travelling today whole day, that I am incapable of judging what's necessary and what needs to be filtered out. LOL.  So I'll just leave it like this. I also want to ask about what the 8 functions interactions feel like to you. I have figured somethings out. I will write that in the next one, this has gotten so long anyways. Sorry if this all looks like incoherent vomit.",1617394011
isfp,"Mhm u isfps when you don‚Äôt wanna do something you won‚Äôt do itüòÇprobably related to the Fi I would think, just following kinda what your emotions say is best for you. Now think about how fun that is for me having two isfp siblings and me having to do all the worküòÇand infjs being prone to being the ones to hold the whole family together that‚Äôs me oof",1617392716
isfp,ohh!!! conflict? i don't know her üòèüòÇüòÇ,1617392313
isfp,"Yup sounds like me lol except for the moodiness. When I was really little I could go from one extreme to another really fast but as I got older I became a lot more even-keeled and even if I get upset or mad now it lasts for a very short time. Also I have ADD so that could contribute to the insane distractibility. The stubbornness though, definitely a thing!",1617392215
isfp,Sorry that was supposed to be a joke. Like I don‚Äôt even know the word :D,1617391471
isfp,"My mom is an ISFP and there's absolutely NO ONE on this planet that avoids conflict more than her. Jesus. Se just goes ""ok"" and changes subject lmao 
I also hate conflict, but I don't avoid it when it comes. Never thought of it as an ISFP  thing, but makes sense 100%",1617391361
isfp,"like, conflict in general. getting into arguments, having beef with someone, etc.",1617388816
isfp,"So I guess that‚Äôs why, even though I don‚Äôt do amazing with ENFJs either usually, it‚Äôs still easier for me than dealing with ESFJs, who are just way more complicated",1617388557
isfp,"¬´¬†Conflict¬†¬ª ?
What do you mean?",1617387785
isfp,"Ok I‚Äôll colour it, I‚Äôm really bad at shading with colours tho lol-",1617387652
isfp,"I mean, I can try to explain to you in a way you will understand using FeNi- which is what I‚Äôm trying here- but if my part fail is due to Ti inferior to back up, I can get abstract very easily.  Usually the message get across, but who knows,if you ask for pure data I will have difficult explaining. 

About the ESFJs having a harder time realizing what they have done wrong yes I see that too. I think Ni is more flexible to question one‚Äôs behavior and noticing patterns also.",1617382606
isfp,My sister and mother in law are both ENFJ and I‚Äôve seen it work the opposite way for some reason. Their ideas seem to have more reasoning behind it oddly enough while the ESFJs seem more impulsive. Also I think ENFJs may have more self-awareness when evaluating the results afterwards and have a better understanding of what went wrong.,1617381018
isfp,"But everyone has! More like an idea. You know, for Te systems to exist and be established they needed to test an ideia too at some point. I don‚Äôt see why Te systems shouldn‚Äôt be revised. Just because it worked before doesn‚Äôt mean it will work forever or to everyone the same way- you know, exceptions exist in every system. 

Now I don‚Äôt think ENFJs do more ‚Äúpractical research‚Äù as you say so.. it‚Äôs more like: I get a ‚Äúfeeling‚Äù that this will work out bc of unconscious patterns I‚Äôve noticed with Ni, so you i‚Äôd be more frustrated with me because of inferior Ti I can‚Äôt quite explain logically Ni vision, in my head it makes sense that I will most likely get the outcome I expected hahah

ESFJs on the other hand use Si, so they maybe know it will work this way bc it has already worked before when they tried with something else. Also Ne wants to explore the multiple possible outcomes just for the sake of it sometimes. + Inf Ti makes it hard to give you a good reason that will satisfy your question and ensure you understand our (Fe doms) thinking process.",1617380461
isfp,"So action movies are fine, because that doesn‚Äôt feel like ‚Äúreal‚Äù conflict, but if there‚Äôs like... a really embarrassing scene, and one person is in a very uncomfortable position for laughs, I usually have to leave the room it hurts so much. My husband laughs because I‚Äôll go ‚Äúno no no no no!!‚Äù if things are getting too uncomfortable.",1617380087
isfp,Then you actually need to have a logical plan backing up your changes before you start lol that would probably be the difference between ENFJ and ESFJ from what I‚Äôve seen. ENFJs do more research on things maybe?,1617379417
isfp,What if I want to get different or better results?,1617378676
isfp,Yup,1617378629
isfp,"Lol yea I do get it. It‚Äôs just so frustrating sometimes! Like don‚Äôt ask me how I do something that works beautifully if you‚Äôre totally going to disregard everything I say anyway! There‚Äôs a very logical reason for why I do things a certain way, so don‚Äôt try to change it up, because you‚Äôre not going to get the same results if you do that!!",1617378253

isfp,"They really know how to take care of people! My ESFJ friend always bake things for me when I forget to eat due to workaholism
It‚Äôs fine not knowing how to help, I think the most important thing is to try and show that you are there! 

I see,hating to be ‚Äúcontrolled‚Äù is a thing I hear very often from ISFPs ! It‚Äôs okay! 
Now yes.. the Ti x Te part hahah I don‚Äôt know what to say bc I‚Äôm a Ti user and it just make sense to me using my own logic sometimes, think about it as the way you prefer to feel with Fi- do things your way- instead of Fe way of harmony and expectations.",1617367845
isfp,"Exactly! 
I think you are right doing so. I'm always too much ""quickly"" trusting of others people :/",1617367726

isfp,"It‚Äôs really easy to get along with them but again, I can be biased as an Fe dom haha

ESFJs really care about other people even if they get upset with little details (Si things),so I find easy to get along with someone who‚Äôs willing to respect your feelings as well !",1617366170
isfp,"Yes! I will admit that the Fi way of doing things can be kinda hmm.. hard sometimes as it prefer one‚Äôs way of doing things, but if you think about it, Si likes to do things their way as well.

It‚Äôs majorly about establishing preferences and respecting everyone‚Äôs wishes without interfering in things that need to be done- like cleaning (those are obligations not preferences,sorry Fi users üòÖ)",1617365996

Just kidding. Maybe not . üòå",1617365625

isfp,"I checked!! Sorry for the late reply been kinda busy here these days 

I‚Äôve met ESFJs i‚Äôm not very fond of and others that are i‚Äôm close friends with too! It depends on how healthy they are for me. Although some people just dislikes them healthy or not and that‚Äôs fine.

isfp,"I‚Äôm an ENFP female dating a male ISFP. I totally get what you mean when you say the living in the moment thing concerns you a little. It is one of the best lessons I‚Äôve learned from my boyfriend, but it is also one of our fundamental differences. For example, I‚Äôve been in very successful and fulfilling (albeit difficult) long distance relationships in the past; however, he doesn‚Äôt think long distance can work unless it‚Äôs an open relationship. That‚Äôs the down side to the connection with strong sensory experience. 

One thing that has worked well is giving him time. I notice that after incident or argument, he is usually thinking about it on his own. It helps to wait to talk things through, even if it‚Äôs just an hour or two. We don‚Äôt always ‚Äúsolve‚Äù the problem/argument, but we‚Äôre able to both talk through it without having knee jerk reactions. 

If your girlfriend can‚Äôt admit any fault and can‚Äôt self-reflect, it sounds like she is just emotionally immature. So that‚Äôs up to you to decide what you want to do with that. I didn‚Äôt know my boyfriend when he was in his 20‚Äôs (we are almost 40 now), but he describes himself as more like your girlfriend before he did some major work on himself.",1617350521

isfp,This makes a lot of sense. My anger is almost always emotionally charged,1617347457
isfp,"Thank you for your input. 

She does love mevery much. She tells me we are soulmates and I believe we are too. She is so loyal. It‚Äôs taken some time for me to lower my walls with some of my past issues. But she has always told me we are soulmates and she has been there for me while I‚Äôve struggled. The living in the moment thing concerns me a little. And some of the silent treatments are bugging but I‚Äôm trying my best to be more patient. She comes back from Virginia next week and she comes to me since we are staying together.",1617345433
isfp,"I‚Äôm thinking that a big part of it is simply immaturity and not necessarily just an ISFP thing. A lot of it does sound like ISFP traits but the total lack of willingness to work with you just seems very immature to me and like she might not be ready for a serious, committed relationship. Trust is a huge thing for ISFPs though. We can be extremely loyal when someone fully earns our trust.",1617344911

isfp,Savings. Sold some stocks,1617342803
isfp,I had basically this same question when I first started looking into mbti. I thought I must be ISTP because I did think I used logic more than ‚Äúemotion‚Äù when making decisions and I was pretty good at figuring out how things work in the moment. But then I realized it could‚Äôve just been because I grew up in a family that heavily valued logic over emotion and showing emotion was always considered weak and vulnerable and we were too proud and strong. Over time I was able to lean more into my actual type (ISFP) and learn to use both together.,1617339561
isfp,I think the two are intrinsic. Do you think emotions come out of nowhere?,1617339546
isfp,"I love the energy of ESFJs and how quick they are to recognize a need and their willingness to help. These things are all completely foreign to me! I‚Äôm slow and in my head and I never know where to start when I wanna help someone lol 

On the other hand, when we‚Äôre together for more than a very short time, I find them to be way too controlling for me. They have very specific expectations which is obviously not something that‚Äôll fly with us ISFPs.. they also have very specific ways of doing things and expect everyone to do it that way which can get quite frustrating. That‚Äôs where most of the classing happens. Just don‚Äôt tell me what to do, leave me alone, and if u want me to help you, let me do it the way I want. 

Another thing I noticed that might be a Ti vs Te thing is that I find that ESFJs for some reason have difficulty following step by step directions or like a recipe, for example. Everything is up for interpretation, they love improvising when improvising is completely unnecessary, add things, leave things out, change things up, etc just because they decided it would be much better their way... but then when a very functional, tried and true system doesn‚Äôt seem to work out the way it was supposed to, they decide that what somehow works for the rest of the world just doesn‚Äôt work for them. They honestly can‚Äôt imagine why that would be. They simply can‚Äôt understand that if you would just follow the steps AS WRITTEN everything would work out fine!",1617338623
isfp,"Omg you have the most accurate understanding of ISFPs!!! This sounds exactly like me! And ISFJ too, like my own ISFJ mother lol but we didn‚Äôt have the same issues when I was growing up.. I always had huge respect for her, and she was so tolerant and accepting of my very (ADD) ISFP ways... so I guess that mutual understanding helped balance things out, like I would always do anything she asked me to do (which then became my ‚Äújob‚Äù) although that was obviously a minimal amount because she‚Äôs an ISFJ after all and must do everything herself if at all possible! But she also gave me my space, except for the very necessary occasional push to get my act together with regard to finishing my degree and getting a job and such lol yes even at that age she was on my case when needed haha but I guess I was mature enough to appreciate it at that point!",1617336254
isfp,"but,, foliage pretty",1617335897
isfp,ESFJs and ISFJs are sooo different though! My mother and two sisters in law are ISFJ and we get along great. But not so much with my ESFJ brother and ESFJ sister in law! I love them when I‚Äôm a great distance from them but if I ever get too close or involved it‚Äôs a total disaster. We clash big time,1617335683
isfp,"It's really just that both of them want to accomplish the same things, but end up doing it in exactly the opposite ways.

For example, my isfp sister will want to do things at her own pace. She might chill most of the time, but she gets things done when they need to be done. And if someone else is doing something, she refuses to participate. It's not ""her"" job if someone else is already doing it. She has this sense of ""I have to do everything by myself or nothing at all""

On the other hand, my ISFJ mom likes to stick to her routine. Now when I used to love with her, I'd usually adapt myself to her routine and help her in all the little ways I could without affecting her routine at all. My isfp sister has trouble doing this. She has to do her own thing every time and so she hates adapting to someone else's routine. Breaking rules is second nature to her as is only natural and it pisses my mom off all the time.",1617335422

I can understand the way you feel about FeSi mixed together and I agree with the weird selfishness vibe, I sense it sometimes too with the ones I know. 
And well, I think they can be really nice and interesting people to know if they want to open up. But normally they don‚Äôt unless you know which buttons to press- which I do. Also I may be biased bc I like getting along with everyone (Fe huh :p) 

I recognize that they lack this specific depth to  satisfy our Ni and I get that coming from an INFJ must be frustrating.. It is even for me. But I was asking the Fi perspective in this specifically because of some patterns I noticed between the ISFPs and ESFJs I know irl haha! I agree with you in some level, still think that you shouldn‚Äôt be so rigid about your opinion on ESFJs, who knows maybe you will met one you will appreciate !

isfp,"I'm getting the sense that you're esfj. Apologies if what i said or am gonna say is offensive. But for the sake of getting to the bottom of this topic. I'll be blunt. So keep that in mind. 

Between isfps and esfjs, they blend in together, but isfps know it's all surface. But esfjs either are content with the lack of depth, or don't care for it. I feel it's the Ne. Ni wants to be focused. And Ne users are different in this regard. Don't draw too much from this. As I'm sure what i want to say isn't coming very well into text. Ne can be overwhelming sometimes. 

Me, i can blend in, even more if i want. Depending on the situation. But that is because of Fe-Ti, and my lack of Fi(my Fi is different). Or if it's the depth i want, i can make it, but it feels forced. It's apparent that they don't prefer the amount of depth that i would want. Which is like all in. I'm sure most people wouldn't want that. My depth happens to be Ti kind. For eafjs, they like small doses of it. Too much of it and they will want to default to Fe. Because esfjs have Ti in inferior slot. One of my friend, who is esfj, after i typed him, and explained functions, i explained him what's the importance of development of inferior function. I noticed his strong preference for Fe in decisions (as it is expected). Sometimes it was to his detriment. When he wanted my advice, he used to understand it, but still hesitant while applying it. But he vibed well with intp friend. But still even that relationship of them was superficial. I knew this because intp used to come to me with problems of esfj. Intp felt that he was taken advantage of sometimes. I think Ni and Ne are like water and oil when depth is concerned. 


This is all external factors, but inside, i can feel that the Fe from them is too much sometimes, and strangely, that Fe feels like selfishness mixed in it. I know selfishness can be a good thing and little bit of it is good to have for survival. But that selfishness combined with Fe gives it a feeling of disengenuity. To me, qualities of selflessness that brings out greater good, is noble, admirable and honorable. It's fine if a person doesn't have these, this is not the kind of Fe i see from them. At least the one I'm familiar with in myself.

Of course, Fe is highly nurture based. Maybe i came across odd ones, maybe there are better kind of esfjs out there that i haven't had the opportunity to meet with yet.

But these are my analysis. I know you wanted isfp perspective. But since you talked about the depth, i delved into my perspective.",1617328587

That's good, I still struggle with my INFP mother so it's relatable for sure. Time heals, but some things still linger. 

&gt;nature of not controlling. But you will need to

Oh yeah, totally! It's definitely more repressed in us though because our extroverted judging (Te) function is so low. It's gotten better as I've gotten older thankfully, still hard though. 

&gt;people think in a same way

Right? I think most ppl use themselves as a point of reference when trying to understand others (without knowing any theories). I did the exact same thing. 


&gt;What do you think?

Great question! It reminded me of [this video](https://youtu.be/OUiLIrK7RmQ) at around the 5 - 7 minute mark -also addresses lack of controlling others- (btw Michael Pierce is a **wonderful** INFJ typologist if you haven't seen his work yet. I **highly** recommend him, you should watch the full video üòä). The idea is that we don't have a strong hold on our mental imagery and associative concepts(Ne with some Si), but rather, a firm grasp on what is real and present (Se) and how that feeds into our understanding of the core of a topic (Ni). Also, our complete lack of Ne and distaste for Fe (those two are considered the two most conversational functions) doesn't help us talk either üòÇ. INFJs definitely have an advantage to us in this way since Ne isn't foreign to them and Fe/Ti just helps with that imo. 

&gt;foolish level of honesty

That's awesome though, considering some people smile and lie all day! I'm actually very selective in what I share although I never try to lie, that makes it hard sometimes xD

&gt;I think this is due to Ni

I agree. Ni is very contemplative. As an ISFP who has ""looped"" on their Ni for most of my life, I also am contemplative, but in a way which deals with how I view my ethics. Haha Ne is to you as Fe is to me, it is stimulating but not always enjoyable LOL. Don't even get me started on my Ne üòÇ üôÉ Yeah, I can vibe with that. An ESTPs Se is definitely flavored differently than mine, and it's definitely something to learn from. Jungian personality theory is amazing man! It's as though this deep, hard to grasp concept that I had a rough idea of (Ni) had been completely confirmed in a way that was accurate, coherent and relatable. It's like holding the mind, I love it. (That reminds me of how ISFPs like my friends and I enjoy archaeology, because we get to physically touch (Se) our history (Ni) and make it have an objective presence (Se) it's just wonderful!). I really appreciate your stance on things, love talking with strong Ni users! üôÇ",1617321549

I'd focus on your Fi and Ni. When someone mistreats me consistently, I don't forget what they've done nor do I expect the situation to improve, nor do I think that it's my job to make them improve. I understand emotionally and ethically (Fi) how I've been mistreated, and I understand intuitively (Ni) that I'll feel this way again and again and again the more I stay around them as they mistreat me. Why do that?  So using my Fi and Ni, I just say, ""nope, dropped"" and let Se keep living life without them in my immediate sorroundings. I make it sound easy, but for me it really is just that simple. Consider them dead and let the dead be. I've considered many dead to me and kept them that way(irl-dont worry internet friends :P).

isfp,"You have a professional therapist, right? You should really follow her advice. She's much more aware of what's really going on than we can ever be based on a few paragraphs of text.

ISFPs are never going to be super forthcoming about stuff. We're not always 'secretive' necessarily, but we are very private. A lot our inner life is just for us, we don't share it with other people because we just don't have any desire to share it with other people. And when people demand that intimacy, when they think they're somehow *entitled* to it, well, let's just say that's not going to go over well. We will share what we want to share when we want to share it. And if we don't want to, *we won't.* 

By the same token, you are entitled to having your needs met in a relationship. So if your ISFP can't give you what you need, you might want to ask yourself if it's really worthwhile to keep trying to make this relationship work.",1617260593

isfp,"Fi is just the basic operating system, running in the background. You might think about all sorts of things, but Fi will sort it into 'aligns' and 'does not align' almost without you being aware of it. You're not consciously concocting a value system, it just comes into being as your brain performs this winnowing process. The value system will change over time, based on your experiences, but you probably won't be aware of how your values have changed until after it's been changed for a while and you look back on a previous iteration of your values and how they no longer apply. Your Se will probably focus on people and characters who do align with your values though. You might like certain political figures or superhero characters or whatever, because they align with your values, but I think a lot of people do that.

Fi is a tricky thing to lead with, and I think a lot of people misunderstand it. It's not being hyper emotional about everything. It's also not a very 'loud' lead function. You'll probably find yourself 'thinking' in an Se-Ni place quite a bit. But your Fi is always there, weighing everything.",1617259900

Important distinction. 

Amd the thing you said about Fi, i was treated that way too. Mistyped, i made a big ruckus about it back then in infj sub. Centered around that selfie trend lol. That thing actually boils my blood too to tell it as it is.

isfp,"I agree, guy comes off as arrogant, and when i say that i understand why he says and how it can be dealt with imo, i dont mean to discount the feelings. Its just the way my mind works and i try to be as open and impartial as i can. I do understand the response a bit better now, with a better understanding of the background of the situation. I dont mind in the what happened in the past as long as future is better. So i don't hold any anger or anything. I do understand thw situation a bit better now, so thank you for explaining to me. Not having that much depth to own feelings makes it hard for me to understand unless the other person opens up a bit. 


The reason i call it is useless is multi faceted, for one, the person showing you hate is immature. Immature people became that way because they are avoiding problems. They are scared of their fears. So when you want them to agree to their mistakes, which they won't, because that would mean acknowledging their fears. Which they will avoid at all costs. Reason completely flies out of the window in this case and they will make it personal. Bad scenario. 

Another way in which you want to approach it maybe youre trying to help him and you actually care, in which case same, if a person can't acknowledge his problem, then he wont try to fix it. In their eyes, no problem, just ego will be shown. 


So there is no way in which you will come out feeling better than before after you have dealt with an immature person. You have to actually face all their problems with him, share the pain and so on. Then the person will see that you care and maybe will listen to you.

Its just better to let him hit rock-bottom and them figure out on their own. Thats why i said that. Your energy is better saved.

Things WILL change for you if you learn to forgive. Forgiveness can be a highly selfish act, actually. You are simply laying down an emotional burden, and refusing to pick it back up again. You don't have to trust the person, you don't even have to be especially kind toward the person. And you may want to completely ghost the person if they are truly toxic. But there's no sense caring about them and putting yourself through emotional trauma over them while they just live their life happy as you please.

The important thing is to understand that we all have a caring heart we all have a brain that for the most part was created for good and it‚Äôs important that we fully understand ourselves and work on ourselves in a healthy way so that when we do meet somebody that is healthy we can really work well with them and also if we meet somebody that‚Äôs not healthy then we know what red flag red flags to look for",1617253595

Control is always taken right?

Im not aware with C S Joseph that much honestly. I just watched my type video and infp video to clear the confusion. He speaks insensitively but it has always been easier to just selectively pick what i want.

In general, the guy is famous for his biases, including having a hand at spreading intuitive bias (and really intuitive superiority to the mainstream mbti community). So, it shouldn‚Äôt be a surprise that there‚Äôs backlash at even the mention of his test on this subreddit (albeit based on berens work) since a lot of isfps have been affected by his negative stereotyping and assumptions. by spreading his work, you‚Äôre spreading his name, and possibly having more people listening to his toxic spiel. I KNOW you come from a place of good intentions and you were just trying to be helpful (and you weren‚Äôt trying to be disrespectful), but you also have to acknowledge their feelings (albeit it came off aggressive) as it is a safe space for isfps (and other sensors). Many of us have loved ones that are intuitives, but when you keep seeing ppl after ppl disparaging you just bc you happen to be a sensor or a particular type‚Ä¶ I understand why some can be a bit defensive and hurt about it. Some can‚Äôt help feeling that way and I don‚Äôt want to be dismissive about their feelings/experiences. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a victim mentality, more of being cautious and defensive especially since the general mbti subreddit has often been not so kind or understanding. So yeah, I do believe ppl shouldn't have jumped at you automatically, but at the same time, I hope you could a bit more understanding about their feelings on him (which I think you now are) 

Also, I respectfully disagree that it‚Äôs useless. If someone makes a misjudgment about me or someone I know, I sure as hell will call them out and educate them. It‚Äôs not a waste of time, especially when they may walk away as one less ignorant hater. I think most fi-doms and -aux can agree with me on this.

isfp,"It is sad to see that many of us try to be something that we‚Äôre not, because society seemingly demands it of us. Feeling forced to take up sensor roles is extremely exhausting and is probably one of the main reasons infj‚Äôs can suffer a lot. First of all, it‚Äôs okay that you are different, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with working in another way, but it is sad that it is often not understood and appreciated. However, that is fine, take it as an opportunity to be something that most others can‚Äôt be. Develop your Ni. Be brave and turn your focus inwards, try to understand your capabilities and develop it to what it can be. Imagine it like building a muscle, it can‚Äôt grow if it‚Äôs not worked, and it‚Äôll easily damage you if you never use it at all. It is more dangerous to be weak than to be strong, as strength allows for control.

We often feel like our Ni is something that‚Äôs stupid or doesn‚Äôt make any sense, but here‚Äôs the thing, it actually does make a lot of sense, and you need to learn why. The human brain has a very deep intelligence that we don‚Äôt understand or appreciate at all. Being an Ni dom, you have a more ‚Äúaware‚Äù sense of your inner processes. What for others might just be a slight feeling that is easily missed, can for you be a strong and clear view. Pay more attention to these feelings, try to watch what is happening when you feel these inner processes working. Live up to your natural potential, as it will serve you more than you can imagine. Do not see your lack of fitting in the norm as a handicap of some sort. See it as a chance to be something different. Be silent, but be brave. Develop your capabilities, and then, once you understand yourself, enter the world and do something that you believe in. Stop living a lie, stop being weak, trust your inner instincts. Be wise and cautious, but make mistakes, just keep watching and learning. You have something wonderful inside of you that‚Äôs just waiting to manifest itself into your personality, and in turn, into the world.",1617439125
isfp,"Let me start out by saying that around a year ago today I discovered the 16personalities quiz via psychology class. At the time and even late last year I was an INTP. This made a lot of sense as I was a very laid back person who had very few friends and I‚Äôm going to school for accounting which is very straight forward.

I‚Äôve slowly changed as a person over the last 6-8 months. I haven‚Äôt really developed any friends that I hang out with, however I have developed many more relationships with people. At work I went from the chill laid back manager to the one that was the life of the crew. In class I‚Äôm very laid back still but if I get conformable or involved in a discussion or with the class I can quickly seem like an introverted person. I would connect this back to high school where despite being very introverted I was the class clown.

Honestly I would say that I love attention because it makes me feel better even if none of it leads to real friendships or relationships. I have noticed it over the past 4 months or so that I have had a serious uptick in people flirting with me or approaching me. I‚Äôm a very charming person but I feel that once people get to know me they realize I‚Äôm pretty shallow personality wise.

This brings up my question, I get so many people that assume I am extroverted based on the fact I‚Äôm a natural people pleaser and I have a deep understanding of emotions yet I have trouble making deep connections with others and ultimately I‚Äôm usually never able to make friends. Is ISFP naturally this way?",1617429001

I'm pretty introverted. The idea of going out seems nice, but when I actually do go out, I'm usually always ready to go home.

I'd say I'm a sensor. I focus more on the present and the past than I do the future. I pay a lot of attention to detail, and I tend to do better in subjects like math and science, even though I like classes like History and English/Language Arts.

Thinking or Feeling? I'd say I do a great deal of both. Most of my decisions are made using both facts and how significant things are to me.

The reason that I think that I may be a thinker is kinda confusing, but it's because when other people make some decisions based off of their feelings &amp; values, I get somewhat frustrated (?). For example, if a friend bought a new laptop simply because they liked it even though the one they had was perfectly fine, I'd be confused and I'd mentally ask why they didn't just keep the one they had.

The reason that I think I may be a feeler is because I tend to do some of those same things that I explained before. Sometimes, my parents, siblings, and friends will tell me that the things I do ""don't make sense"". Also, most of my decisions always cater to me, and I usually don't even think about including other people in my decisions.

Idleness and boredom sitting at home, wondering what kind of social activities I‚Äôm missing out on.

Did not take initiatives in progressing social activities 

Usually feeling overwhelmed in social situations.

Plagued by negative emotions like jealousy

Age 15-18: most optimistic time in my life. Had a girlfriend. Lots of love. Enjoyed Blink-182 songs. Their stage banter and funny/sad/happy songs showed me what was possible.

Video games like Warcraft 3, the Sims, D2 for thousands of hours...

Age 19-21: on the inside I thought I was cool and calm, but the moment I began speaking I realized
My verbal skills lacked because I wasn‚Äôt getting the feedback from others as I hoped. Others seem indifferent to me. I‚Äôd get surprised when a social relationship doesn‚Äôt turn out as I pictured, and not knowing exactly what went wrong. I think I got a lot of rejections from people who I wanted approval from. 

Age 22-29: trying to find myself in the office world. Felt like I was often intimidated by others at work. I always felt nervous and did not come across to others as confident. I usually spoke in an inaudible low volume, and mumbled or stuttered. I was shy and there was a time when I was bullied at work for being not as productive or engaged as others in the office work. That sucked. I had to learn how to deal with emotions like fear, anger, shame and sadness.

I thought I‚Äôd be happy if I was finally working and earning money. Nope. I couldn‚Äôt find purpose in helping companies sell more product to consumers.

isfp,"Hello everyone, hope you all are well.  Recently, I‚Äôve indulged into the personality testing and I tested as an ENFJ and my girlfriend has just tested has an ISFP. This personality test has helped me to really see a lot of things that I need to work on but also to see a lot of things that I can now understand why I make those decisions or why I act a certain way or why I have this feeling. One thing that I am starting to notice is that I am more involved in facing our issues within our relationship. I‚Äôm not an ISFP but I‚Äôm trying to understand one and I would be super stoked if you guys would be able to educate me a little bit on how to fully understand a female ISFP. 

I have a lot of PTSD and anxiety from a couple things that I had happened in my past. My father was a Marine for 39 years and he was pretty hard and me growing up and my mom was the strongest that she could possibly be but she also enabled a lot of the problems like alcoholism and some emotional and verbal abuse because my dad is a very intense individual. Growing up with him was hard but it‚Äôs made me who I am today and it‚Äôs made me an enfj. One of my biggest fault is that I don‚Äôt communicate in a way that I feel my ISFP is understanding what I‚Äôm saying. Enfjs use intuition and feeling to navigate in the world and I am thinking that my ISFP sometimes runs from conflicts and that‚Äôs kind of where we are at today in our relationship. For about nine months I have been pretty convinced that I have been the problem the entire time because of my PTSD and my anxiety that I have and I recently started to see a counselor because a lot of my family and even her suggested that it would be a good for me. Before my girlfriend was going but she stopped going for some reason about 10 months ago. There‚Äôs been some things that have happened where in the beginning of our relationship she‚Äôs accuse me of possibly cheating on her which was a simple misunderstanding she found my aunt shirt in my one of my bags and thought it was someone else‚Äôs and she kind of had a little bit of a meltdown about it. Then she kind of was distant and she made me feel pretty insecure and my intuition kicked in and I kind of decided to look into her Snapchat and see what was going on and I found a couple pictures of her ass being snapped to other people and some conversations that were inappropriate while we were together but within the first 4 months of our relationship which we fought about but I‚Äôm letting that go. I‚Äôve talk to her about some of the stuff and she won‚Äôt own up to any responsibility.  she continues to tell me that she‚Äôs done nothing wrong and I‚Äôve done my best to let all that go and work on my PTSD and anxiety. 

One thing that Im really worried about is that this new counselor that I‚Äôve been seeing has been giving me a lot of information a lot of good information. it has helped me to see that I am not the only one with the problems in fact my parents and Ariahna both believe that if I go to counseling all the problems will be fixed. Which that is not true according to my counselor. It‚Äôs 50-50. So I‚Äôve recently brought this up to her and she‚Äôs unwilling To except any responsibility on her part. The other day I went and sat down to have a meeting with my counselor me and my girlfriend  had a fight during that day and I had a counseling session and She was going to stay and go through the counseling session with me which was on a zoom. My counselor came on we started to talk and the first thing that I had said was that I am beginning to have feelings and I‚Äôm starting to learn that I‚Äôm not the only one with problems and that when I try to talk to the people that I feel are having problems they don‚Äôt want to accept it and don‚Äôt wanna work with me and I‚Äôm now starting to think that I‚Äôm better off without them including my parents. This didn‚Äôt make my girlfriend feel good and she actually got up and walked away and left and never came back. I continued my therapy and explain to my counselor what was happening and she said that it sounds like she is not ready to face the conflicts and then I need to start focusing more on myself. After my session I went and met up with her and discussed with certain things what had happened. She continued to not want to take any ownership. She had told me she feels that my counselor is trying to slide in and fuck me which is just absurd because I love her and the counselor that I have is not even attractive. For the last 10 months I have been the one that‚Äôs been given the reasons for why our relationship is failing and is she says that it‚Äôs due to the fact from my PTSD and anxiety and how I get so upset when I can‚Äôt get someone to understand what I‚Äôm trying to say. So for the last 10 months I have been the one that‚Äôs been insecure trying to figure out if she‚Äôs sleeping with somebody, is she talking to somebody, is she getting someone‚Äôs attention from work she won‚Äôt tell me anything she‚Äôs secretive she holding all her feelings and then when we are working on things that I felt were my issues She tells me that she thinks that my counselor is trying to slide in and fuck me and it‚Äôs made me think that she‚Äôs been holding in those feelings for a long time and that it‚Äôs part of her personality as an ISFP. How do I get her to try and except some of the responsibility. She‚Äôs lost motivation she‚Äôs always tired never has any energy granted she works three part-time jobs and we never really get to see each other but from what I‚Äôve read I understand and I SFP need some space alone time and that‚Äôs totally cool I can totally give her that but right now there seems to be a lot of trust issues on both sides and I can‚Äôt seem to understand why she refuses to take responsibility for her side of issues.

isfp,"Yesterday, I advised someone to use C S Joseph's test to type themselves and some individuals attacked me like I was C S Joseph himself. I would request that you read the whole post.

My points:

1) Test is based on work of Dr. Linda Berens and C S Joseph character doesn't have  anything to do with the accuracy of results.

2) Every person, no matter how bad can have something worth learning from. 

Person debating with me completely ignore the first point and, one person even called me a person of low character for believing in second point. Then there is a victim mentality going on that every intuitive is just out to get you. And one person derived from me mentioning the word illogical in a sentence to some troll, meant me calling all ISFPs illogical. 

The point of everything up there isn't to prove to everyone that I am right or wrong. It's to establish where I am coming from. I don't care about being right, being right doesn't get you anywhere. It's when you actually establish an understanding, and solve the problems, those are my intentions.

&amp;#x200B;

No, I don't consider you guys illogical, nor do I agree with what C S Joseph might have said about your type. If you give a sort of blanket treatment that all intuitives are enemies, then it will make it so. Yes there are preferences for our functions, I completely love your Fi clarity, and your Se. I wish I could get my Se to that level. and Hopefully I could someday make my Fi critic to shut up. haha. And as far as Ti goes, it's not good enough to fully rely on. If you saw my day trading in crypto LOL.

&amp;#x200B;

I admire your type, the relative ease with which your type glides in life effortlessly, I envy that honestly. A person who I admire a lot, is an ISFP. This person changed my life. Because of how much I believe in this individual, I could derive the strength to completely go against the tide and put everything on the line. I grew more in a period of less than a year, than the whole 25+ years of my life before that. They stuck with me when they didn't need to, believed in me. This kind of pure heart I never saw in my life before, and for this I loved that character. This gave me a lot of strength to solve a lot of problems. In a difficult time, this person was like the solid ground that I could stand on. I know the trust that can form. Briefly speaking, that's the respect I carry for your type. This is from my personal experiences. 

&amp;#x200B;

These are somethings I wanted to clear up. Because the notion that intuitives consider you less is ridiculous. If anything I see a lot of people wanting to be sensors actually. If you see a hater, hating you purely based on functions, then know that the lack of knowledge and the immaturity is to blame, and wasting any energy on such person is useless. I got no idea what type of response I would get from this, but I am hoping for the best. But I don't mind putting myself out there and the possibility of making myself a fool. It's a risk that I have become much more prone to taking. If anything that I said was wrong then know that it was unintentional, and I apologise. Thanks for making it to the end.

I can spend a lot of time reflecting on what bothers me and finally finding what‚Äôs wrong. I find myself feeling bad about the way something was done, and then I have to dig to find rational answers to my discomfort, that I can then expose to my partner in a very structured discourse.

When negative emotions are not so deep, like some coworker doing something wrong, I immediately know what‚Äôs wrong and I don‚Äôt physically react to that. At least I‚Äôm not overwhelmed. 

As for positive emotions, i think I don‚Äôt really experiment them. I can feel good about a situation afterwards, thinking ""yesterday was so cool"" but not feeling it during the event. I often force myself do to things because I know I‚Äôll end up thinking they were cool. I learned how to ""look"" happy when I know a situation should (and will, afterwards) make me happy, so I‚Äôm polite and I don‚Äôt offend the people I‚Äôm with. 

I feel like I don‚Äôt ""actively"" feel emotions.

I am curious about how your relationship is with an ESFJ family member. Mine is heading towards the avoid and ignore route - my esfj sister has began ignoring me after our reccent fight which was due to miscommunication. I think I have gone to her bad side terribly to a point that she doesn't want her things to be beside my stuff and putting things between us to separate herself physically from me. 

To give some context, she was waiting for me to finish work before heading to our parent's home. I had to do overtime and she said we could leave after an hour. I finished earlier than an hoir and booked a cab without telling her first. Then when the cab arrived, I told her that our cab was here. She got angry about me not telling her and she said that we were not ready yet. I was puzzled by what she meant. When the cab got cancelled, she decided to clean around the condo (we were renting a place near the workplace). I got upset and tried to control my feelings so I did not move. I was already feeling stressed and anxious about her work, and her reaction from what I did triggered my anxiety. Because of it, at the last minute decided not to come with her anymore to our parents due to high levels of stress. 

You see, there were a lot of miscommunication there and yes I admit it I caused it. It was unintentional but it really made her angry. I wamted to have a sit down with her to settle everything and it looks like I already lost the chance. Both of us were expecting things from each other and we didn't know what those are - hence the fights.

Anyway to go back to the topic, has anyone of you been ignored by an ESFJ family member? How do you manage your relationship with them? Were you able to salvage your relationship with them and how?",1615767247

* Can be defensive sometimes such as when I corrected her wrong answer during group work. She got mad then decided to not participate in the class activity anymore
* We don‚Äôt speak anymore after I once canceled a hangout on her to take an exam with a classmate. Since then, she gives short replies or ignores me. 
* Likes to write Happy New Year statuses on Facebook. In one message she thanked people who interacted with her, said she made new friends, discovered how misery brings people together, and thanked friends for putting up with her

I'm    21. Male. I am a university student studying molecular biology but I   am  taking a year off from school because I believe paying full tuition   for  online learning is bullshit. I go to school for the experience:    marching band, kendo club, volleyball, and full access to the  libraries.   Right now I'm working at a warehouse as a package handler  and I   actually really enjoy the job because of the consistent hours,    straightforward tasks, and laid-back and funny nature of the people I    talk to compared to others at my school. I hated my job as a cashier at  a   grocery store because it felt like I had to kiss every customers  ass   for no reason. I plan to go to grad school for forensic science  and   toxicology.

* Is there a medical diagnosis that impact your mental/comportamental stability somehow?

No. I am neurotypical.

* Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?

My    mom was pretty controlling and verbally abusive. Grew up in a  divorced   family with a set schedule so I was stuck with her majority  of the  time  with my older sister as a kid. Made you trust her one day  and hope  she  would be a better person but then snap on me for no  reason. I  recall a  time where I took out the trash and started to  unfurl the  trashbag  somewhat hard and aggressively to reline the  trashcan. She  cornered me  and started yelling at me in the kitchen for  no reason.  I  would get in  trouble for no reason over minor things  like this more  frequently as I  got older before 18. Probably her way  to exert more  control.

She   dragged me to church  and I hated it because of it's two-faced nature,   boring ass sermons,  and twisted doctrines, especially its views on   homosexuality. I recall  zoning out in the church pews by tearing paper   of the church programs  repeatedly, doodling, or looking at the   reading/music notes in the  songbook. She later switched churches after   it opened its doors to gay  people. Being gay myself it was felt like a   personal insult to me and  still one of the reasons why I have issues   with her to this day. When I  was 17, I remember sticking my DS down my   pants to hide it from her  and ditched youth church service to play   Pokemon while sitting on the  side of the building near the parking lot.

I    was with my dad every Tuesday and every other weekend. Much less    controlling and seems to actually understand me as a person much more.    Trust him exponentially more than my mom. Actually did things like an    actual caring parent: listens, showed up to actually watch my marching    band competitions and varsity sports games in high school, packed    lunches for me as a kid, gives useful advice, and taught me how to    actually socialize and work through my personal flaws when it came to    dealing with people.

3 days after    my 18th birthday I got into a huge fight with my mom and called my dad    to pick me up. I still live in the same house in my room to this day.

* What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?

See above.

* If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?

I    would feel fine if I had the whole weekend by myself, but not    ""refreshed"". I could get bored though if I run out of things to do    online. I would not feel lonely.

* What    is your relation with movement and your surroundings? For  instance  do   you prefer a sport or outdoors event? If an outdoors event  what is   it?  And why? If not what type of activities do you tend to  engage i?

I    interact with my surroundings when necessary, it's not that I    necessarily have a preference for outdoor things. I really like playing    volleyball, marching, playing music, and hiking because it is fun and    stimulating. I have found that those experiences have given me the  most   happiness at a certain moment in time when I look back. Indoor    activities that I really love doing is watching anime, youtube, and    reading.

* How    curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute?  What   are  your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it     environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?

I'm    a pretty curious person by nature. For example, I like looking into   how  certain people tick or watching a video essay/review of my favorite    franchise, anime series, or movie.  I'm usually not overflowing with    ideas at every moment and usually have a single one for a time set for  a   specific purpose. For example, I had one idea for a melody of song   that  I am collaborating with somebody to write. The idea is more    environmental because it leans towards tangible music that I had to work    with.

* Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?

Personally    no. I think I could be good at it, but I think trying to set an   example  for others and always pretending to care about guidelines would   be  annoying. My leadership style would be demonstrative and to the   point  however. No tolerance for bullshit.

* Are    you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do  you    enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?

I    would say I'm coordinated. I do not consider myself to be a clumsy    person by nature. I'm only clumsy when I'm thinking about something that    may be bothering me. I only enjoy working with my hands if I'm   creating  something like pixel art or playing an instrument.

* Are    you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not  particular    artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what  forums  of   art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.

To    an extent. I really enjoy making pixel art and manipulating sprites  of   pokemon based off of an idea or creative concept. I remember  turning   pokemon sprites into androids as commissions for other people.  I have   also dabbled in songwriting because I'm pretty good at  singing. I also   appreciate art. For paintings, I feel like surreal and  abstract pieces   have the biggest stories to tell, but I feel like  music is more   powerful.

* What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?

The    past is useful because you can learn from it. The present is meant to    give you joy through experiences. You should have some idea of what  you   want for your future but keep it open. Thinking too much about the   past  tends to lean me towards negativity. Thinking about the future   generates  too many what ifs.

* How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?

I    normally assess the request to see if it's worth my time. I only help    them if I get to teach them about a topic I care about or if I  consider   them a cool person.

* Do you need logical consistency in your life?

Yes.

* How important is efficiency and productivity to you?

Generally important.

* Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?

I    control others by pretending to be interested in what they say or do   an  act of service for them just so I don't get on their bad side if I    request something from them in the future.

* What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?

Drinking: makes me more susceptible joy and laughter caused by my surroundings; I fear less judgement

Volleyball: Its fun

Hiking, Kendo: therapeutic, physical, fun

Watching anime: it's passionate; there's always a story to tell; it's entertaining and brings joy to an otherwise mundane world

* What    is your learning style? What kind of learning environments  do you    struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning     styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity,     or your physical senses?

My    personal learning style is self-directed reading combined with   visuals.  I need access to a student tutor when necessary as I work by   myself  through a problem set. I like being in control of my pace and   learning  environment. I struggle with long winded lectures because it   can get  boring or I could lose focus on an overall topic as I get   fixated on  details as time passes on. I hate morning lectures before 10   am. I  prefer classes with memorization and some logic.

* How    good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects  into    manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and     improvise as you go?

Okay    at strategizing and may struggle breaking up a project into chunks. I    work in bursts of energy. Capable of planning and working for an    extended period but it tends to stress me out more when I think about    the logistics. I wing stuff if I get tired or begin to lose interest.

* What's important to you and why?

Being    comfortable with myself because I want to live a life with few   regrets.  My personal freedom is also important to me because I like   having  control over my own choices and interests.

* What are your aspirations?

Finding a career I actually like, finding the right person, and improving my skill in creative pursuits like music.

* What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?

\-being seen as  a sociopath and getting painted as the bad guy

\-people turning on me

\-irrational people

\-loud noises causes by barking, construction, leaf blowers, foreign languages, fire alarms

\-people telling me how to live my life as if they know better

\-people making whole assumptions about me based of my tendencies or habits

* What do the ""highs"" in your life look like?

They    tend to be rooted in concrete experiences: marching band competitions    (watching other bands perform on the field and competing to win),    getting drunk or hanging with people you actually like, winning our    inter-mural volleyball games, going on scenic vacations like Hawaii or    Yosemite

* What do the ""lows"" in your life look like?

Crying    over the abstractedness of certain subjects like linear algebra or    computer science in college because of the inadequacy of feeling stupid    to not being able to handle logic-heavy stuff at a fast pace; people    talking shit behind my back when I made the effort to be friendly with    them, they could never express their problem with me in concrete  detail   and then I get in trouble for it; crying over barely ever  getting   considered to actually play in a varsity volleyball game as I  rotted   away on the bench; getting excluded from cliques for no reason

* How    attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you  pay    attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware  of    your surroundings while you do so?

I    would describe myself as a person that is somewhat attached to     reality, but does not daydream or ""zone out"" often. I usually think     about a funny meme I just recently saw, drama at work, or what is     happening around me. I usually don't think of various what ifs for    mental stimulation. I'm usually aware of my surroundings and prefer to     be.

* Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?

How boring it would be. Perhaps go to sleep if tired.

* How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?

Perhaps    a week. I usually weigh out pros and cons and look at what's  important   to me. Is this decision going to be worth the time and  effort? I  usually  don't change my mind.

* How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?

Takes    me few hours. Maybe even a few days. Not sure exactly. But generally I    feel like it takes me some time to consider the situation before    vocalizing what I might be feeling out loud or put it into organized    words in my mind. I suppose emotions are somewhat important to me in    life, well mostly mine at least. I have a tendency to bottle up emotions    and explode in anger if under pressure. This happened to me a lot  more   as a kid.

* Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?

Most    of the time if I disagree with somebody I just sort of end the    conversation if I don't like them. If I like the person and feel a need    to educate them then I would keep conversing. However, I don't think I    often do this. I sort of don't see the point in trying to sway  somebody   from their point of view because I don't see it as a personal  mission  of  mine to spread my word like it's gospel. I also don't feel  like it  owe  it to people to appease them in some way so I just stay  quiet.

* Do    you break rules often? Do you think authority should be  challenged,   or  that they know better? If you do break rules, why would  you?

I    usually don't break rules, but yes I do think authority should be    challenged and checked from time to time. Authority should keep it ego    in check and corruption is a big no no. I only break rules when it is    convenient for me like jaywalking or sneaking food into the library.

* What is the ideal life, in your opinion?

isfp,"* Doesn't care to meet or speak to anyone unless she finds them interesting, which is usually only people who share her same fashion sense and makeup style (she refers to them as chic). With these people, she'll act friendly.
* With everyone else, she hardly speaks so people find her either quiet or snobby. Her demeanor isn't very approachable since she tends to speak with her natural resting bitch face expression
* She speaks freely without sugarcoating her words. This may make her come across rude at times but she doesn't care if people dislike her
* Since she doesn't care if people dislike her, she's also bold enough to confront people when something gets on her nerves. However she doesn't often engage in drama since she doesn't want to waste her energy arguing with people. Instead, she'll give a few witty comebacks then dismiss herself or tell the other person they're dismissed. 
* Enjoys spending her free time at home watching makeup tutorials, fashion vlogs, and other beauty guru stuff. If she's out, she enjoys shopping and eating at restaurants. 
* Works customer service at a retail shop and is majoring in marketing so she can have some career involving fashion in the future
* Prone to laziness especially with schoolwork; she has failed a few classes due to not trying hard enough but she doesn't care much about failing either. She's a big procrastinator who doesn't put much effort into her work
* Prone to being late to school and appointments. She prefers taking her time to get ready instead of rushing.
* Often believes she's right about her opinions and can be stubborn about it. A friend thinks being ""thicc"" is better but she keeps insisting looking skinny is the best and won't change her mind when the friend tries schooling her about how being underweight is unhealthy. Another friend thinks streetwear fashion looks really good, but she disagrees and won't budge when the friend tries convincing her how it looks good.
* In relation to the last point, she can be judgmental about people who are too different from her. She judges overweight people because she finds them visually unattractive and because she's all about being skinny and she judges ""manliness"" on women (i.e. women spreading their legs sitting or being overly athletic) because she's all about being ""chic and girly"".
* She's very into looking skinny and girly to the point of a lot of people finding it to be fake because it seems overdone like she's posing and changing her natural voice tone higher. She's constantly talking about everything skinny and girly, so I believe she wants everyone to see her a specific way.
* Very materialistic; her tumblr blog was full of high-end designer photos such as Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Celine, YSL, and more. She doesn't own many designer items, but she thinks it's goals to have a huge closet full of everything designer.

isfp,"Hello, everyone I recently have been studying about sensory processing sensitivity (SPS) which is an attribute of highly sensitive persons (HSPs). I am curious to see if certain MBTI types are more likely to be HSPs than others, so I am going to post a poll in each subreddit about this. **You can find out if you are an HSP by taking the following test:** [**Are You Highly Sensitive? ‚Äì The Highly Sensitive Person (hsperson.com)**](https://hsperson.com/test/highly-sensitive-test/)**. A score higher than 14 on this test indicates that you might have SPS (you are an HSP).** If you do not like the binary nature of this test you can take the version used by researchers here: [Microsoft Word - HSPSCALE\_2007\_research.doc (hsperson.com)](http://hsperson.com/pdf/HSPSCALE_2007_research.pdf). A score of 105 or higher on this version indicates that you likely are an HSP (I calculated this cutoff by using the cutoff for the shorter version which is 15/27 possible points and assuming that the same percentage of points on the longer test indicates that you are an HSP). **If you are willing please take the test to see if you are an HSP and then fill out the poll below. Thank you.**

I am also going to post some research articles here for those of you who would like to learn more about HSPs and the research behind it (I am quoting from another post that I made about this):

""Hello everybody, I have recently been looking at various studies regarding HPSs. To be honest when I first heard about HSPs I thought that the idea was either a false pop psychology idea, or autism spectrum disorder or anxiety disguised under a fancy name. However, after reading the studies I will list below I am now convinced that sensory processing sensitivity (SPS) is real and that being an HSP is a unique, valid concept. I believe these studies are useful to get an in-depth understanding of what it truly means to be an HSP and they can also be useful to show that the idea of HSPs is valid. Here are the studies:

[The functional highly sensitive brain: a review of the brain circuits underlying sensory processing sensitivity and seemingly related disorders (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5832686/) (Discusses fMRI studies of SPS in comparison to autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, and post-traumatic stress disorder. This review shows that SPS is its own separate, unique trait and is different from the previously mentioned disorders)

[The highly sensitive brain: an fMRI study of sensory processing sensitivity and response to others' emotions - PubMed (nih.gov)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25161824/) (Provides evidence that higher HSP scores are correlated with ‚Äústronger activation of brain regions involved in awareness, empathy, and self-other processing‚Äù)

[The trait of sensory processing sensitivity and neural responses to changes in visual scenes (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3023077/) (‚ÄúSPS was associated with significantly greater activation in brain areas involved in high-order visual processing (i.e. right claustrum, left occipitotemporal, bilateral temporal and medial and posterior parietal regions) as well as in the right cerebellum, when detecting minor (*vs* major) changes in stimuli.‚Äù)

[Sensory Processing Sensitivity Predicts Individual Differences in Resting-State Functional Connectivity Associated with Depth of Processing - PubMed (nih.gov)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33561863/) (‚ÄúThe present study showed that SPS is associated with \[resting-state\] brain connectivity implicated in attentional control, consolidation of memory, physiological homeostasis, and deliberative cognition. These results support theories proposing ""depth of processing"" as a central feature of SPS and highlight the neural processes underlying this cardinal feature of the trait.‚Äù)

[Higher sensory processing sensitivity, introversion and ectomorphism: New biomarkers for human creativity in developing rural areas (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3409988/) (Discusses various aspects of SPS such as its involvement in creativity and also its presence in animals)

[Temperament trait of sensory processing sensitivity moderates cultural differences in neural response (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2894664/) (‚ÄúHere, 10 European-Americans and 10 East Asians underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing simple visuospatial tasks emphasizing judgments that were either context independent (typically easier for Americans) or context dependent (typically easier for Asians). As reported elsewhere, each group exhibited greater activation for the culturally non-preferred task in frontal and parietal regions associated with greater effort in attention and working memory. However, further analyses, reported here for the first time, provided preliminary support for moderation by SPS. Consistent with the careful-processing theory, high-SPS individuals showed little cultural difference; low-SPS, strong culture differences.‚Äù)

However, in contrast to Aron and Aron‚Äôs finding that the scale is unidimensional, the current results support a three-component structure consisting of Aesthetic Sensitivity (AES), Low Sensory Threshold (LST), and Ease of Excitation (EOE).‚Äù ‚ÄúAES showed the strongest relation with Openness to Experience, while LST and EOE were found to be most closely associated with Neuroticism.‚Äù Unfortunately, this study is not free access, but if you are a student or faculty at a school you might be able to get access to the full text through your institution.)

Two hundred and one college students completed the highly sensitive person scale, as well as measures of anxiety, depression, alexithymia, and autism symptoms. EOE and LST were related to autism symptoms, alexithymia, anxiety, and depression. AES was related to attention to details (a symptom of autism) and anxiety but not to depression. It was also negatively related to externally-oriented thinking (a symptom of alexithymia). Results indicate that AES is conceptually distinct from LST and EOE. Furthermore, EOE interacted with difficulty identifying feelings in predicting anxiety, indicating that being both easily excited by stimuli and unable to identify one‚Äôs feelings is particularly anxiety provoking.‚Äù)

The HSPS scale was found to be reliable in this study and ‚ÄúFactor analysis revealed a novel five-factor solution (Negative Affect, Neural Sensitivity, Propensity to Overwhelm, Careful Processing and Aesthetic Sensitivity). As per previous reports, latent class analysis suggested a three class solution.‚Äù The study also discusses some weaknesses of the HSPS scale that could be improved such as the lack of reverse-coding in the assessment to address agreeability bias (i.e. reversing statements to make them negative). For example, I avoid violent movies could be easily reverse coded by switching the wording to I enjoy violent movies, but the original scale does not do this for any of the questions.)

I am aware that Reddit is not representative of the general population, so these results will not give an absolute indication as to where each MBTI type falls on the political spectrum on average, but I still think these polls could be useful to form relative comparisons (i.e. are INTJ Reddit users more liberal than ISTJ Reddit users, etc.). Please answer the poll and respond with any thoughts you have below. Thank you.

isfp,"hey guys, i began studying the mbti types like a month ago and when i got enfj as my type i was extremely surprised because the ""protagonist
 type"" really didnt feel like me, i always felt like i didnt belong anywhere and im so obssesed with being part of a certain community that i got obsessed with mbti. i really relate to some enfj things but at the same time im not really that ‚Äúhelp seeker"", like i dont feel the need to always help, i want a lot of time for myself and sometimes im not even that extroverted, i always fake it especially at school, always change my
 personality to be liked and get along with everyone that i came to the realization that i dont even know who i am anymore. in extremely ambitious, extremely organized and i always want to improve myself and find new things to do. im energetic and positive but at the same time i feel lost and often misunderstood. i feel like i dont belong anywhere and with anyone and that i just change my personality so often that i dont know who i am anymore. whenever i see enfj movie characters they re always so lovely and extroverted while i have often my own introverted phases that i get confused of. everyone thinks of myself as the ‚Äúkind and perfect person"", while the truth is completely different. am i really an enfj? what do

isfp,"Short and relevant info about myself: I'm an 18nb ENTP and still live with my mother. I will be living with her for another 2 years.

(Both of us are correctly typed btw, we even sat down together to take various tests)

She is a wonderful mother. The big problem: we fight. Like, a lot. Some fights even escalate because we heat each other up.
I have to admit that I'm often the reason for her to get angry, it happens subconsciously and both of us only apologize to each other at the end when the damage is already done.

When she gets angry, she also tends to become stubborn and refuses at any cost to view things a different way. I can basically bring the most genius arguments and all of them do nothing. They even make her angrier.
She insists that she is an independent person and doesn't want to be influenced by me, saying things like ""i do that because I want to and because I can do!""

She only realizes and admits her mistakes whenever I'm  right hours after the fight.
(I of course apologize too whenever I made a mistake)

But oh God, im talking too much here. My actual question is:

How can I effectively calm her down since none of my methods have ever worked?

How do you ISFP's wanna be treated whenever you get angry?

How is someone able to calm you down most effectively?

Its worth a shot, right?

isfp,"I feel bad for sort of losing my composure earlier, though I have apologized for it. I have a lot of NF friends. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I don't mind sharing my ideas, when I'm allowed to do so at my own length, but my PoLR Ne really acts up whenever I feel put on the spot, and I wish I had better control of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I understand logically the concept of ""There are no stupid questions"" the point of asking things is to gain information. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, I don't mind being asked things but with my NF friends it always goes a bit beyond that. Four things that really exacerbate it are;

&amp;#x200B;

A. When they ask a bunch of questions at once, but don't clarify which is the \*important\* one to answer, so I get confused and I'm like; ""Okay...which of these do you want me to focus on, and answer first?""

&amp;#x200B;

B. I've been explaining an idea of mine, and suddenly they ask a question about it, and it makes it clear that the whole time I thought they were following my idea it turned out they weren't following at all, and now I feel incredibly stupid for not explaining it well enough. Which leads to my mind being like; ""If they didn't get your idea the first time, don't waste your words the second time.""

&amp;#x200B;

C. They give me a bunch of their ideas all at once, and are like; ""So what do you think?"" OF WHAT!? Where do I even start? You just sent me like 20 paragraphs of your random ideas, and want to know what I think? I mean I'm impressed you put in so much work, but I don't want to sift through all of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

D. Being put on the spot in any kind of way. Seriously, I am a deer in the headlights when I get put on the spot. This happens more with people who want me to logically explain a decision of mine, so it's less so with NF types. An ESTJ I know pulls this a lot with me.

isfp," I had a crush on this guy last yr. I remember overhearing (though they didn't intentionally say it loud so I could hear them, I j heard them from across the classroom,) his friend ask him why he was staring at me (if he was doing it bc he liked me,) and he said that it was bc he was trying to figure out why I looked so sad all the time. He then glanced me over and said, ""Besides, I couldn't go out w her. She's average. 5/10."" He then looked at me for a few more seconds and said, ""Actually... below average. 4/10."" We were in freshman yr of hs.

But I'm wondering what his reasoning for staring the other times was. I remember he once like, idk, started staring at me when I was walking down the halls w a friend and he was w his friends and like we j both kind of stared at each other and I get the sense that he was like, maybe going to come up and talk to me? I felt weird bc he was w his friends, I almost got the sense that he was going to introduce me to them? He stared at me for like a while... I ended up walking away w my friend but idk what he wanted. And then I remember he stopped once to stare at me (but I was far away, talking to a friend when we were prepping for a track meet,) even though class had already started... he was j def staring at me while I was talking to her. And there are like 1 or 2 other incidents, what was probs his reasoning?

I love to message my friends randomly and ask how they're doing or to tell them a funny story and rarely do I ever get a response. One of my friends straight up told me I'm too much to handle. She went from talking with me all day practically to now only replies with one or two word responses and the change is obvious so I'm done with her. I'm also worried that people think I'm not genuine or something. That probably hurts my feelings more than being ignored. I'm just getting really sick and tired of trying to spread good vibes to people when nobody else even tries to out forth any effort to maintain a friendship. They think talking to eachother once a month means we're good friends. I'm sorry but I need a bit more interaction than that. Not only that but nobody is remotely interested in what I have to say but I will spend hours listening and comforting them when they are upset. I feel so alone. I feel like I'm just a vending machine for when people need a pick me up. and then throw me away when they don't need me anymore. I just feel like I always drive people away by being ""too much"", but that's just who I am. I'm not a people pleaser either, I just feel like if you love your friends who should show them or tell them often. I feel like my friends don't love me the way I love them and it makes me feel like I'm being stabbed in the stomach repeatedly. I don't have a good relationship with my family so my friends are all I have.

Do people just misinterpret our actions and behavior? Like they think we are trying to manipulate or something?

isfp,"Ever since I started mbti I took a test and have gotten INFJ from 16 personalities (go figure..). But I wasn't satisfied, so I kept taking tests to see if it is true. My result kept changing and that's where I went to mbtitypeme forum to get typed. Being a person who have little to no knowledge of the deeper side of MBTI (functions), I was typed INFP. But the difference is, I wasn't being the most honest. I add spices in my post to show my creative and intelligent side despite all of it being imaginary tales. So it kept on going, I learn mbti from different sources to unravel the truth and study cognitive functions. I narrowed it down to two option, INTP or INTJ. I thought I was an INTP because of how relatable the  the type is, but it just does not fit me on the surface and in some other areas. INTJ on the other hand is relatable, but not the Te side, I have always abhor that. 2019 December until the February of 2021, I kept searching. The longer im in this mbti community, the more concise and precise I am, disregarding all traits but focus on the roots of function. Until finally, I did my last post with the better understanding of self in hoping to stop this ever crisis. Deep inside me, it has always been Fi talking, but Ti and Te is much more prominant on the surface and this is probably because I am a guy. Its been Fi and Ni interacting this whole time! My need for identity, purpose. My understanding of other feelings are not at all Fe, its Fi! I felt it, how my emotions sprouts desire to know. Despite having intense emotion, I have always hidden it only for my mind to see. Well I don't want to be embarrassed, and I have always been cerebral. Cutting of my feelings from externalising my whole life, because logic always triumph over feelings. But I always felt melancholic, ""no this is not it, its not me"".

* How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.

I am a 19 year old male who is currently a student in Security studies. I am curious and knowledgeable on some abstract topics like manifesting and the law of assumption by Neville Goddard. I think i never initiated to befriend a stranger. Every friend i have is a result of them approaching me, also i have a lot of acquaintances, but mostly people gravitate towars me. I disliked most of my time in school because it was too rigid and too inflexible. Also, i think it was invented mostly for visual learners, and people with good memory, which i am both not. I can't read something mechanically and just remember it, i need time to reflect and think about it.

* Is there a medical diagnosis that impact your mental/comportamental stability somehow?
* No.
* Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?

I am Orthodox Christinan, atleast on paper. I am more spiritual than religious.

* If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?

Refreshed .

* What is your relation with movement and your surroundings? For instance do you prefer a sport or outdoors event? If an outdoors event what is it? And why? If not what type of activities do you tend to engage i?

When i was younger i was more into outhdoors sports with friends, but now i am more interested in solitary or 1 on 1 activities, whether physical or abstract, doesn't matter. I can do both.

* How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?

I don't come up with ideas that often, but i am a deeply curious indiivdual. I am fascinated by space and planets, systems and astronomy. I was watching Perseverance landing on Mars and i was happier than a child.

* Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?

Well i don't mind being a leader, but i don't prefer it. I prefer to be in the background working on something alone, something noone else can do better than me. But if i had to, i would lead and i would be a flexible leader, not too rigid.

* Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?

Sometimes yes and sometimes not, I am coordinated but not very fluid. I can appear stiff at times.

My movement is much more erratic, unpredictable and quick than slow, fluid and graceful.

I like working with hands like chopping wood and sawing, it's good when i'm stressed or angry.

* Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.

I am but the best at it. I can sing here and there and draw, but i usually do it just for fun. I like listening to music more than singing. Music is the only art i am interested in, especially Alternative Rock.

* What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?

I can't explain this, but it's kind of hazy. I sometimes reflect on the past but i am a very forgetful person, and i already can't remember what happened a few days ago, let alone last year. I am somewhere between the present and the future, it's the best way i can describe it. My attitude is ""No point in dwelling on the past, whatever happened happened, i have to keep moving forward"".

* How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?

I find the best way to help them according to the situation. If it's a trivial matter like buying something then i will help but will feel inadequate. I prefer helping with serious problems, and not some trivial matters (even though routine is very important for the world, i am not the best person for that)

* Do you need logical consistency in your life?

I observe logic of others and then formulate my thoughts based on that, so i can be naive sometimes but that is what happens when you are open-minded

* How important is efficiency and productivity to you?

Efficiency is very important for me, because i want to do everything in the best way possible, so that i spend less time and achieve more. That's why i like to prepare for something first before jumping in, therefore i hate surprises. Productivity is important but efficiency comes first. Both are needed for a synergy.

* Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?

Hmm, maybe if i suggest them the best way to do something, but then i realize that everything is subjective.

* What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?

I prefer classes with creativity and physical senses, i dislike anything that involves memorization, and i can live with logic.

* How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?
* What's important to you and why?

Truth above everything, love, family, meaning in life, having my own freedom. What is the point if you can't live your life on your terms and living a lie? That's why.

* What are your aspirations?

I want to finish college and get a job, then i will se what i really want to do after my family stops bothering me about the degree lol. After i get the damn degree, i will continue to find some job that allows me to be myself, to provide something to the world and have a chance to improve everything.

* What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate?

My biggest fears are fear of failure and fear of losing loved ones. Noise, overwhelming stimuli and nosy people make me uncomfortable. I hate shalowness, unsolicited advice, and ignorance. Overly emotional or/and dramatic people make me very uncomfortable.

* What do the ""highs"" in your life look like?

Everything going the way i envisioned it to go. All gears on, smooth sailing.

Achieving what i want and feeling good about it, discovering the meaning of everything and how it relates to me. Doing something with my life, something unique. Self-actualization.

* What do the ""lows"" in your life look like?

Just beating myself up for not doing or trying enough. Feeling hopeless and bitter. Rage.

* How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?
* Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?

Get out exactly the way i got in, via door, or the roof, maybe.

* How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?

It takes a lot of time for me, but when i make it it's set in stone (with maybe a little place for reconsidering). It depends on the situation.

* How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?

Emotions are pretty important to me, it takes about a day if it's something serious. If it's something trivial i can shrug it off.

* Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?

Rarely, if it's someone i care about i will never agree with them on something that isn't true. Because i want them to improve and know the truth, whereas if a stranger started arguing with me, i would just admit he's right and move on. What's the point in arguing with a stranger?

* Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why would you?

No, i respect the rules if they make sense, and authority should be respected if they are doing the job right.

* What is the ideal life, in your opinion?

This a very complicated question, i don't want to write too much in order to be concise, but i will say something.

The ideal life is living according to your values, living life on your terms and succeeding in whatever you want to do in this reality. That would be the biggest ideal to me.

isfp,"Hi guys!

I (infj F) have been living together with my friend (isfp M) for several years now. we're both in our late 20s/ early 30s and buddies / roommates (nothing more).

one of the things i realized about him is that it is exceptionally hard to criticize things he did. even if it is not personal at all, like nicely asking him to remove his beard hairs out of the sink after he shaved (because i wash my face in the same place and it just feels unsanitary to me) he seems to take it extremely personally and doesn't really respond, tends to shut off and isolate for several days.

It is getting harder for me to talk about stuff w/ him that isn't inherently happy-go-lucky bc. he seems to just be crushed by even the tiniest things. 

recently, he blamed me for losing some item of his in the kitchen. bc. i am the one who mainly cleans up the shared living spaces, he felt i was responsible for losing the item, even though i have no idea where it was and  i certainly don't misplace or throw away any of his stuff. so he smashed a bowl of mine out of rage, and when i confronted him about it, asking if he did it on purpose, he first evaded the question, then started screaming at me and since then has shut himself off in his room and goes out of his way to not be around me in any way.

i decided to just let it be and since them i'm ignoring the issue, bc. honestly i also don't see how i am to blame in this situation. i stayed calm, tried to rationally tell him what the situation was from my point of view and when he started to scream i just removed myself from the situation.

can you maybe tell me from your experience what might be going on? i have the suspicion that there might be something bigger underneath this whole petty affair, but i don't want to pressure him to talk about anything he doesn't want to share. But it is important to me to resolve the issue, bc. i am also a harmonious person and don't like misunderstandings like this / being blamed for stuff i didn't do. Also, i don't like the role he's placed me in, since i actually take some effort in keeping everything clean, i don't blame him for being the messier one, but i can't accept if someone takes my efforts for granted and even accuses me for it. 

do you have some insight in what may be going on? and maybe know any advice on how i should best respond to the situation? i actually value him as a friend and don't want this whole thing to go down the drain because of miscommunication.

Unstructured: Most likely an IXXP. She likes heving her options open, and uses a long time to text back. Says she procrastinates a lot.

She lived in a place where it was status to wear branded clothes. She strongly disliked this, and didn't fit in with ""popular people"". Says she doesn't care about fitting in with others.

She worked in a hotel, and enjoyed being service-minded.

She is studying economics and business law at BI.

Likes numbers, and says she did not have to study to get good grades in math.

She is practical and realistic, does not like abstract / theoretical conversations.

She is most logically inclined, and is not concerned with social harmony. Says she will immediately confront someone if they treat her badly.

She majored in art and design. She says she preferred making things rather than drawing/painting.

She struggles with with language, and does not like writing.

Believes that all paintings have a meaning.

I said that some people just don't get along, or have any chemistry, even if they have to live together. However, she feels it doesn't make sense and is odd if groups do not like each other when they are forced to be together (Kpop groups live together).

Likes a ""cute"" style of dress.  Dresses, heels and pink in the summer.

She enjoys traveling and learning about different cultures.

 She manages to concentrate better with people around her. She says that she considered herself ambiverted; although, my impression is that she is stoic and calm.

Says she was very quiet during middle school.

 Likes practical and realistic stories, not magic (Harry Potter).

Cares mostly about the vibe of a song over lyrics.

Do not like horror. Likes the genres drama and love

She believes that if something treats you badly, you are not justified if you are mean back no matter what.

She thinks BTS (kpop group) has become too mainstream, so she doesn't like them as much anymore.

isfp,"Hello fellow introverts/ ISFP.  
 As an ISFP who has struggled with self-confidence, some of my recent life experience have yielded some positive insights, and I thought I‚Äôd share it as an encouragement to fellow introverts. 

My introversion and sensitivity used to make me feel worthless. I was constantly paralyzed by fear of how other people thought of me, every little detail of my appearance, the inflection and diction of every word I use. Apart from close friends and family, I had no confidence expressing my thoughts to others, especially in a large group setting. My worst fear was to appear stupid, awkward, strange in front of others, which of course became a self-fulfilling prophecy. I hated being hypersensitive to other‚Äôs perception and thought that there was no possible good that could come from this trait. Things eventually got a little easier after I‚Äôve gained some confidence through becoming good at a few hobbies and making some good friends along the way. But I still always envied extroverts around me and thought about how much easier things would be if I wasn't always self-conscious.  
 

I‚Äôve recently finished school and started a new job which has forced me into daily situations where I have to lead people through highly stressful and emotional discussions, usually in a 1 on 1 or smaller group setting. I‚Äôve began to notice that due to my awareness to other people‚Äôs perception and emotion, I‚Äôm able to pick up small clues of when others are beginning to have negative emotions (sadness, anger, frustration), usually a lot earlier than others can. This has given me the ability to dig deeper into the conversation to identify and address problems leading to these emotions before things escalate to a unmanageable level. I‚Äôve gotten a lot of positive feedbacks from coworkers and managers on how well I‚Äôve been handling difficult situations that I would never have imagined myself doing years ago or even prior to starting my job.

Now I‚Äôm a lot more appreciative of the early painful years of fearing what other people think, and see my introversion and sensitivity as a skill that I‚Äôve honed to help me navigate through social settings. I now feel more validated paying attention to the little social details that used to worry me to death.

With all that said, I'm still terrified of many things such as dancing in front of others ( I don't think this is something I'll ever get over). Grocery shopping can be hard sometimes too. But now I'm more ok with these limitations.

They have been venting to friends but not said anything directly to the boys

They remember what one of the boys said abt them going on tangents, and decide when they have their prep meeting again that they'll be muted/quiet unless spoken to or asked for their input. However, they notice that now that they are muted, both boys are unmuted and talk to each other abt which song to choose/their classes/general stuff (the boys essentially j talk to each other now that the girl is muted.)

She does sit through it but feels angry, that the boys j wanted to chat w each other, that they are making the org+club involvement exclusive to themselves even though she did a lot of work, unwanted... by the time that 15 minutes have passed she is very upset, though she still does not say anything, and even though she understands that they need to prep for the meeting, she feels strongly unwanted and that they j want to be by themselves... and so, although she wouldn't normally, she leaves the meeting abruptly, almost impulsively, without notice 15 minutes in, as they are j talking to each other while she has been on mute for most of the time.

She feels weird abt it and knows that it will cause a rift but cries to herself, vents to friends some more, and doesn't re-join the meeting. She admits to one of the boys when he messages her that she felt unwanted/disliked, and is generally a lot more quiet in meetings w them moving forward (tho she is touched by the boy apologizing/clearing things up)

So my dad is an ISTP and my mom is an ISTJ. It makes for a really weird and distant relationship. They love me, just in their own way. I never felt understood by them though. My dad always telling me to get a practical job, since happiness doesn't matter as long as you have money to survive. My mom is just very blunt and to the point, an extreme perfectionist as well. Everytime I would attempt to do a nice thing for her, she would find some way to criticize it so it's made me not want to do nice things anymore.


Another thing is since my parents are both extremely introverted, we don't get together a whole lot. My family doesn't eat together for dinner or have family friends over or anything of the sort. My parents also have a really weird relationship. They were ready to get a divorce and everything but then just decided not to since it would be too much work. I still don't think they get along great but neither of them seem very caring towards the other.


Out of two other ISFPs I've known, one had an ESTJ mom, possibly an ENFP dad. She didn't get along with either of them at all. The other had an ESTJ dad and ISFJ stepmom, who he tried to get along with but I could tell it was hard.

isfp,"Although I score really high on Te and Ti for whatever reason on these functional tests, a lot of my thought processes, I think, just do not fall under Ti. As a Ti dom would, I am not constantly bringing in objective data or facts from the outside world and testing such concepts against my framework about the way the world works. I am not consumed by solving problems impersonally all the time, and using my Ti to break things down components on a daily basis. Yes, I value the truth, but in practice my first reaction is to evaluate it against my feelings. Next I poke holes in the truth, and say why its bullshit using external sources. Whenever I get questions about logical frameworks and models about the world I get confused actually on these tests.

I know ISTPs are notoriously bad at describing their feelings and the source of them. However, I could usually tell how I'm feeling about a certain person or a thing. I'm intensely uncomfortable about sharing my deepest feelings about someone or something. Additionally, I'm not the most empathetic person. I've been called selfish many times by my family, and I'm actually very sensitive but I hide it behind a mask of indifference. I think such attributes about myself, the indifferent and privacy made me think I was an ISTP for whatever reason perhaps? 

Moroever, I was really academic in high school and pretty got much all As. Perhaps being good at academics and being all analytical made me think I was a Ti-dom perhaps. However, me getting those good grades was wrapped up in my self-image. I was motivated to get high test scores to outdo others as a way to stroke my ego. I was pretty competitive about such things. I also wanted to get into a decent college to have as many options open to me as soon as high school was over.

I hate it when people impose their view of what they think I should be doing or how I should act on me. I actually get very angry about people who preach about such things.

I've looked at my journal, and man, I've recorded my inner turmoil in writing and is it wild. A lot of it seems to be wrapped up in wanting to connect with people but scared to do that, not wanting to be controlled by people's perceptions of me, and wrapped up about what ideal image I want myself to become. It's interesting.

The CS Joseph test was interesting because it said that ISTPs primarily create to solve a problem, and that many skills they have look more like technical mastery. The ISFP derives self worth from what they create in order to create an experience. They are often wrapped up in what people think of their work, perhaps too much so. ISFPs love their reputation. One my pet peeves is actually being seen as a villain or a bad guy in certain situations. And yes, I actually sing as a hobby (because I'm pretty good) and record song covers. I derive self worth from these covers, and I tend to listen to these covers over and over to see if there are any flaws.

I'm not sure if any of this is ISFP. The whole ""moral code"" and ""value system"" thing is confusing to me. I do remember getting really angry when my aunt was in fight with my dad. She was defending her alcoholic boyfriend for his intolerable behavior and she said: why are you on my case about his alcoholic tendencies when you have a picture of your dead friend who died from alcohol poisoning? That was the most rage I have ever felt in a long while. I guess that seems to be somewhat through moral code? I don't even know.

I'm not sure if my behavior is indicative of an ISFP. In truth, whenever I make decisions, I honestly don't think it wrapped up in logic.",1612175509

isfp,"In Japan there is an ancient tradition of lyrical poetry known as ""Jisei"" translated it means ""Death Poem"". A death poem for those who practiced this art form would usually be written towards the end of someone's life or before facing a death threatening scenario (war, duels, extreme illness, etc). Though sometimes they could be written early into adulthood for it was believed a person could never truly predict exactly when death would come for them. 

A death poem could contain any kind of information but there was a heavy focus on a personal insight to the one writing it. This usually wasn't advice (though it could be) they were writing but just a gloves off, masks off, deep long look at themselves and their relation to life on some level as they saw it and taken out of themselves and written down for others finally to see who they were and what they thought in a land with a people ""stereotyped"" as being introverted and harmonious.

The themes and attitudes of death poems range all over the place: Longing, beauty, confusion, goals, desires, cynicism, bravery, love, depression, loyalty, humor, etc. There were rival schools of style in the teaching of how to write death poetry. Some schools of thought had the poems rhyming, others focused on lyrics related to nature, some on a audible tonality harmony, etc. Put simply there was no one correct way to write them and they were written by nobles, merchants, samurai, Zen monks, commoners, and men and women alike.

The death poems come in a few structures traditionally with three of them for example being; Haiku with 3 lines with a syllabic count of 5-7-5, Tanka (short poem) with 5 lines and a syllabic count of 5-7-5-7-7, Choka (long poem, and usually reserved for eulogies) which had the same structure as the tanka but just repeated the line and syllabic structure over and over again until the person writing finished saying what they had to say.

A few examples of death poems can be found in this seven minute video which also contains some relatively modern examples written by Kamikaze pilots before flew to their deaths on suicide missions in World War 2: https://youtu.be/Xp1xwzb4b8Q it also contains a few book references at the end for furthering reading on the subject.

Finally I know the subject matter is a bit morbid for most but I just don't see it that way. I am curious to see how you would construct a death poem. I am asking and encouraging people to try writing one as a mental exercise and I am curious to see if there are any themes that come up that seem related to type or not should you chose to share it in this thread. I don't expect anyone to present master level poetry as most people haven't written a poem since elementary school if that. 

If people choose to share please be kind to them and their work. Leave brutal criticism only for those who specifically ask for it.

Now take your time and figure out what you have to say. Be brave and test yourself with something new.",1612139080

isfp,"I tend to take some pride in being myself. 

Well part of what I enjoy is sometimes being silly. I'm a 1 on the Enneagram so at times to prevent myself from taking myself so seriously I have to unwind a bit, and find something to laugh about.

I will at work sometimes dress up in silly outfits, and a coworker of mine (We'll call S) does too. This is something I did at a previous job as well.

Whenever I do it as this job though some of my coworkers...one in particular will say things like;

""Oh S is rubbing off on her.""  ""Air's been spending too much time with S.""  


And I've gotten past the point of irritated and into straight up pissed off. I actually cussed at the ""particular"" coworker, and went off on a pretty scathing rant about how; A. I dressed up in silly outfits back at my old job. B. I'm older than S is so by technicality I've probably been doing the dress up thing longer than he has. And C. telling me that I'm only doing it because of S is like saying that I only eat ramen because I watch Anime. 

I was very upset, and I didn't apologize either. Usually when I go off after I cool down I will apologize for losing my temper, but I was fed up with what felt like my individuality getting trampled on. I was tired of trying to peacefully, and calmly explain that S and I just have a similar sense of humor and that I wasn't being influenced by, or copying him. 

&amp;#x200B;

Deep down I felt hurt... I did eventually feel regret for losing my temper, but I still don't believe I need to issue an apology. This lady I have tried to calmly, tactfully, and peacefully explain to her several times that S, and I just happen to find enjoyment out of dressing up in silly outfits, and every single time it fell on deaf ears. No matter how I worded it, no matter how many times I told her; ""Nope you dress up cause S rubbed off on you""

&amp;#x200B;

I felt like she was saying to me; ""You're a fake person who only does what other people do.""

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry this turned into a rant. I feel like it is a bit of an ISFP thing though. The Fi in particular so INFP...all XFP's can probably relate strongly but I'm an ISFP so I'm posting here.

isfp,"So ever since I realized a while back I was an ISFP and not an INFP (or INFJ), I've been trying to think of instances in the past where I displayed Se and I have a good example to share. Just want to see if anyone else finds it relatable at all.


So as you can see from the title, this has to do with the summer Pokemon Go was popular, but I still kind of dislike it to this day. I've never had an easy time articulating why I dislike it so much, but I'll certainly try.


First of all, I never thought much of the game. I somewhat enjoyed playing it whenever I visited the city, but since I live in the middle of nowhere, it wasn't a great game imo. My birthday was at the end of the summer and I was turning 16. I had invited two people to celebrate with me, my bf, an ENTP and my friend, an INFP. They were both hooked on this game and couldn't stop playing it. Even on my special day, I felt really awful because it was like this game was ruining a day that was supposed to be fun. I had no interest in playing it but they did. Even after voicing my concerns, they didn't seem to care a whole lot. I guess it didn't seem like a big deal to them.


Note I'm still with this guy but we both have matured greatly since we were younger so this isn't something I can say he would do anymore. But overall, I found this game kind of disregarded my Se. I wanted to spend time with my friends, doing fun things in the real world while everyone else wanted to immerse themselves in this game I didn't quite understand. Even once the popularity died down, people I knew would still play it.


That same summer, I went to NYC with my bf and we both played the game while walking around Central Park. I tried really hard to get excited by it, but I just couldn't. It was cool seeing more rare pokemon here and there but in the end, they're not real and there's no real reward there. And often I would feel bad whenever I caught rare pokemon and would rather my friends have them because I just didn't care that much.


I feel bad for resenting the game for dumb reasons and no hate to anyone who enjoys it. I just kind of realized it took away any enjoyment from the real world. You're looking down at a phone instead of looking up at whats around you. Or maybe I'm just too cynical. Either way, Se am I right.",1611873083
isfp,"Hey, I have a question but I just need to vent for a moment. I go through lots of bouts of self-criticism, depression, and extremely low self-worth. I grew up with really hyper critical and judgemental parents, that didn't compliment me very much or tell me they were proud of me. Growing up I got a lot of judgemental comments from my parents about my appearance (I was already self-conscious about being overweight and having red hair), or just expressing disappointment that I didn't get a better grade on a test, or that I wasn't doing as well as one of my older siblings. I never felt like I was good enough for them, and so I never developed any self-worth for a long time. I know my parents do love me but they are horrible at showing it and don't understand other people's feelings very well. Out of my whole family me and my oldest sister are the only two ""feelers"", which is why we were close as kids.

Puberty was really hard, I was already an awkward kid getting bullied at school but I never told my parents about what was happening, possibly out of fear of how they would react and make the situation worse, but mainly out of embarrassment that their kid was a loser and couldn't stand up for himself. When I finally did start fighting back they got angry at me and didn't even acknowledge why I was fighting in the first place. The same day I kissed my would-be wife for the first time (we were 16), my mother (who is obsessed with brushing teeth and commenting on peoples teeth whiteness) said ""do you expect any girls to want to kiss you with those yellow teeth?"" These are just examples.

I found out a few weeks ago that I'm most likely ISFP and start reading on how to improve and be a better person, one of the things I came across was that our inferior function is extroverted thinking, which I think may explain why I was so sensitive to criticism growing up and always wanted my parents acceptance and approval, and possibly why I eventually snapped and had such an extreme rebellious streak in my teen and early 20s.

I'm 28 now, married, doing decent for myself. I won't lie there's been a lot of pain still but I learned how to manage and thankfully found a great woman who supports me no matter what and tells me she loves me for who I am. I feel like a lot of my anxiety still comes from trying to gain other's acceptance, and when I don't feel like I am doing that I go into deep, dark negative spirals bordering on suicidal thoughts. It usually happens if I feel like I've let somebody I care about down. I get the voice in my head listing off all the reasons why I am trash and that nobody really likes me, and it takes the same tone as my parents. 

Is there any way to deal with this inner critic or make it go away completely?",1611870958

isfp,"I infected a friend with the MBTI curse, and he's certain he's got Se, and that he's an introvert. 

He's also certain he's a 9 on the Enneagram scale which does seem to be more of an ISFP thing, but it's not impossible for ISTP to be a 9 as well.

The confusion is because the way Ti gets explained makes it where he's not sure if he actually has it, or if he's an ISFP that's using some Se-Te combo to sort of mimic having Ti, by being observational, taking in data, etc.

How can we find out which he has? Or what's a good question to ask?",1611847010

isfp,"hi,

i'm 23 and next to my artistic friends, whom i've known for over 15+ years, i've never been able to keep up with their business skills, pace and passion. whenever i try to make my art/visual skills a profession, i end up doing 1-2 weeks of intense entrepreneurial work and then get kind of blank, dismissing the whole thing for months and/or just lazily working on some ads there and there or stuff like that. my current clients are my collagues who order my work around 1-2 times a year. not so great for going full time.

the thing is, i don't ever get anywhere. and i know so many ways one could make money with their skills, i know all the quality requirements and even what to do ""right"" on the marketing, numbers &amp; ""boring""-stuff side. but i just... it's too overwhelming.

i keep trying, especially in this modern online age where it should be easier as you don't even have to show your face when doing the marketing speeches and such. but i can't produce ads/products/personal projects/etc as fast as the social media needs me to without burning out. and i've been having burn outs regularly in the past few years because of getting myself too much work that my personality and very being cannot handle, lol.

my ideal for my business would be something like this: i create my stuff whenever, do a high quality photoshoot(or a editing spree if it's photography) after creation is finished, post it somewhere noticeable without much of a text (i personally don't like advertisement text as i cannot get it ""real"" enough and it bothers me to write fun gibberish that doesn't represent me at all), add a price and contacts and that's it. maybe try to get my stuff on a gallery or something. then i go on with my daily life, answering emails and phone calls the old fashioned way, arranging orders and photoshoots. and so on.

the problem i see with that idea, is that everyone &amp; everything seems to scream it's very outdated and also a very difficult way for me to get clients to actually get me paid. maybe also other problems i'm still lacking in experience to see. i also lack the skill to mathematically adapt, so to speak, to find my own way in this kind of theme of life.

so.... any of you ISFPs who've been in the freelance industry for longer and have gotten to a business routine you feel comfortable with? please share any tips you can... thanks.",1611824271
isfp,"There is published research about the best way to compliment your kids.  If you call them smart, amazing, etc, then they are less successful because they don't take risks that compromise their need to believe that they're smart.  They are also more likely to think that success is related to some inherent quality, and that you can't improve through hard work.  Parents that don't compliment their kids by saying smart, beautiful, etc, have more successful kids if they shine a light on qualities like hard work and whatever is more involved in the process than the result.  I was ""overcomplimented"" and it made me very insecure.  I thought amazing things about myself, but was scared to put it to the test, and in the end had crippling self doubt.  If I found out I wasn't as amazing as I was told, then it would be a serious hit to my ego.  My parent's love wasn't conditional or anything, but for some reason the way they complimented me made not being smart a really threatening thing to my psyche.  


All that to say, despite knowing this, I compulsively overcomplimented my kids.  My very confident 5 year old who seems to have many isfp traits was saying the other day that he was smart, and asking something like, why am I the smartest and other boys aren't smart?  (I've never compared or said smartEST or anything)  I honestly told him that there's people not as smart as him and people smarter than him, and that he was not the smartest.  


Later that night tucking him into bed, he said, why do boys think they're smarter than everyone but they're really not smart (he was not upset)?  I told him that he thinks that because I tell him he's smart a lot, and I tell him that because I love him so much and so everything he does seems really smart and pleasing to me.  Similarly, when I tell my daughter she's beautiful, I try to be honest and say, you're so beautiful to me because I love you.  

&amp;#x200B;

I'm doing a really poor job at preventing their identity from being wrapped up in some specific quality.  I remember when my daughter was a toddler I tried to call her kind, and she said something like no, I'm (name).  As if, come on, isn't being me enough?  Wouldn't you still love me if I wasn't whatever it is you called me?  Nevertheless, compliments were too ingrained for me to give up.  


In any case, was wondering what the ISFP reaction to what I told my son would be.  Any tips on recovering from emphasizing his intelligence status too much would be appreciated, too.  How can I offer better compliments to a probable ISFP?   


P.S.  You guys are amazing.  I don't naturally understand ISFPs well, but seeing one grow is mind-blowing.  You've got to be better than average at functioning well in life, and you're super amazing and thoughtful and empathetic.  Also intelligent, but you wear it on the inside, not on the surface like I do.  Haha, there I go compulsively complimenting again.  But seriously,  I love ISFPs &lt;3

isfp,"There's a girl I work with, who I really like. I'm an INFP and she's an ISFP. She's the one who told me to take the personality test. 

We've spent a lot of time together, most days for just over a year. I really started to like her a while back, so around 3 months ago so I asked her to go for a walk, as a date. She was initially a bit freaked out by the word date. She seemed really nervous and flustered but she said yes. Then she text me later apologising for freaking out and followed up with saying she'd absolutely love to. 

So she definitely likes me at least a little bit, I think. I hope. But the day before we went for our walk she said she's not really looking for anything atm but still wants to go. Which I was cool with, we still went on the walk which was nice and we still talk all the time. Even more so now than before tbh. We walk home together after work and talk about all sorts of stuff, and text all the time. It can get pretty deep sometimes, talking about each other's problems and all sorts. We can really open up to each other.

She's definitely quite innocent. She's never had a boyfriend or been on a date, in her mid 20s. So part of me thinks she's just a bit freaked out by the whole romance thing. Intimacy issues maybe. The only reason I think so is because I used to be the same. I had serious intimacy issues when I was younger, I could barely look a girl in the eye until I was about 20. I let a lot of potential relationships pass me by because I was simply too scared to act on them. I found it all absolutely terrifying.

SO, my question is. How do you ISFPs like to be asked out? How do you like things to progress?

Of course, I'm pretty weary about trying to do anything considering she did say she isn't looking for anything. But the signs are just too strong to ignore, sometimes she just starts crying when she's talking to me and I've never seen her do that with anyone else lol. She can also get a bit nervous around me sometimes and I always catch her looking at me at work.

I've been thinking about maybe asking her to go for another walk but just as friends. Emphasis on the friends. Maybe say something like lockdown is lonely and boring, fancy going for a walk? 

Just so we can spend a bit more time together without having the pressure of romance looming over her head. And maybe one day she'll feel comfortable enough.

This is your subconscious speaking haha. I am an ENTJ and I have a lovely ISFP roommate (and friend!) who just got out of a toxic relationship with, I think, a very unhealthy INFX. I was wondering, what do you guys do to get over a breakup? He comes to my room often just to talk and I listen and let him pour his heart out, but I am very bad at comforting people (Fe demon, man). Do I  have to hug him? I made a snack box for him with my other roommates but he is so down when he thinks no one is looking. 

They ended it really maturely, and they have been talking the last couple of days about getting back together but she ultimately declined. He was so heartbroken, he really thought she was the one even though he realises she didn't treat him right, but he's got kind of a saviour complex.

isfp,"So I am an INTJ(M) have been seeing this ISFP(F) since last October. We had gone on a few dates (movie, dinner, shopping...) and we texted almost daily but all from October to mid-December. 

I think we had a connection here and there from the way she behaved and shared her interest and personal stories (traveling, teaching, chess, and past relationships) so this told me that she trusted me quite a bit. 

However, after our last date in mid-December (just lunch and exchanging gifts...), I felt that she was gradually drifted away. She went trekking with her 2 of her closest friends on a mountain for 3 days and 2 nights for the new year. After that, she didn't seem to be responsive anymore (takes longer to reply, response without enthusiasm, declined to hang out...). If I don't initiate contact then I don't think she will. Earlier this year, I accidentally unfriended her on FB and she had been refusing to accept me again. I tried asking her about this but she refused in a mischievous manner (lots of emojis and laughing). I am not sure if this is how she wanted to be playful or just the ISFP thing to not want to hurt other people. 

Last night, after asking her out for the 3rd time and she declined because of being busy, I kind of getting irritated and asked her directly if she just doesn't have time or just doesn't want to hang out and she said that she is tired, she just went trekking and doesn't want to play anymore and just wanting to focus on work until after February. Then I asked her so even if she had time now then will she hang out with me just the 2 of us. She replied no she wouldn't want to hang out with anyone in this timeframe, even if they are her best friends. 

I understand her need to be alone like any other ISFPs but after texting me that she still posted stories on Instagram in some restaurants twice times. 

Do I have any chance now or she is just giving me signals to tell me she lost interest? Any case that ISFPs regain romantic interest after losing one?

And what do I do to ISFPs in their need for isolation? Leave her alone and not talk to her? Sending out handmade pop-up cards (I got the interest from designing and making pop-up cards from her) to her occasionally to tell her I am here for her?

After calmly thinking again, I think I am being overly sensitive and making a big deal out of this. I got cheated twice before so my tolerance for bs and deception is really low.

isfp,"********* in short *******

I want to develop Ne and Fe so much. 
I feel like I want to care for other people more. It's not like I dont care but I want to care more and treat good people around me better. 



********* long story ********** 

Example, someone in my group of friend has got depressed. We all understand her situation but she becomes moody and mean to other people all the time that no one wants to talk with. Once she said that the rest of the groups talking on the topic she's not into (pets and babies) so she's gonna left the group but we're cool. (She said this herself) We still say hi when we met occasionally and clicked like and comment sometimes on other social media. 

It turns out one friend in the group (Enfp) invited her back. She accepted and came back, she seems happy to be in the group again then few months later, it went all the same and she left group again. Now another friend (esfj) talked her back and she accepted and came back into groupchat again. Then years later, she left group again and the third friend (esfp)talked her back once again. 

I know it sounds stupid telling this story. (Now everyone says if she leave group again, there's no one gonna drag her back because everyone gives up on her already) but my focus was at how my other friends treat her. I do care about her and pm her asked if she's ok. I thought I respected for what she said she wanted so I didnt bother to ask her back to group. I didn't realize she actually wanted us to talk her back. All of my three friends (enfp, esfj, esfp) said nothing when they went drag her back. 

I knew it long after and I admired that they knew what she really wants. Attention. And my other friends are cool enough to not mind but give her what she wants since she's depressed. 

But as I said, I'm focus on that my friends have known it. I want to be like them. I feel like in relationship, we sometimes have to go out of line to make it better. Like if I respect that she wanted to leave and let her be. We will start to fade away and end up disconnect.

We're drastically different people, and I feel like we polarize and amplify each other's personalities. 

As an ENTP, he is blunter with sentiments and is a strong defender of what he thinks is the truth, and he will defend it to hell. He believes poor people unlock less potential for happiness, so they are less happy in life. I say it's all relative to each individual, he calls it bullshit, and as usual, I feel dumb!

As an ISFP, I sometimes &gt;!(okay, full disclosure, a lot of the time)!&lt; am piloted by jealousy. I often go by a ""curb your damn ego"" attitude &gt;!(or a water bucket in your face, anvil on your head type of ""calm down drama queen"" frame)!&lt;. My friend always has this in-your-face confidence, and he'd always say ""You gotta admit, I'm like so much smarter and more handsome than everyone from our class."" (casually sweeping under the rug the fact that I'm in the class). Then I would get all bitter and try to water down his confidence with old oak tree wisdom like ""maturity is more important than intelligence"" or ""that depends on what you value as intelligence"". Pretty sure those words never reached his brain.

But then I'd have the self-confidence-crisis where I think ""maybe he **is** better than everyone,"" and ""what if **I'm** the deuteragonist in this story? Am I the dumb sidekick?"". The fact remains that he's scarily good at charming others and making intuitive connections to get a full story, which he prides his intelligence on &gt;!(also why his life is dramatic clusterfuck that I must help him navigate through)!&lt;. And so long as I don't respond to his politically incorrect ideologies or mildly narcissistic sentiments, we get along pretty well. &gt;!Come to think of it, isn't that gaslighting? Isn't that what narcissists do? Or maybe it's just ""oh that's just ENTP, silly!""!&lt;

I always contemplate if this is a healthy friendship. He occasionally brings out the jealous side of me, and I feel like I'm repressing his true, confident nature by always spraying water at his fits of passion. But at this point, we're not questioning it since we've identified as ""best friends"" for years. Still, I get frustrated at times.",1610630331

isfp,"I hate texting and calling; I rather just meet up and hang out. It take so much energy to keep up the convo and they tend to want to have the convo throughout the entire day, like constant replies after another. And they expect it every. single. day. It's just so exhausting and draining. I try to tell them to not text/call as much and that I'm pretty bad at texting back. They agree, but they continue to keep doing it. And when it becomes a pattern, I just leave them on delivered. Apparently, they come to the assumption that it's ghosting, get butthurt, and another friendship/budding relationship just breaks off. 

I don't get it. Why do we have to be in constant 24/7 contact with one another to be friends or be in a relationship. It's through a freaking screen. Like I'd much prefer if they invited me to hang out or drop by my place every day than send fake lols every five minutes. Seriously, they could just do this and I would love it. If you miss me, then let's arrange to meet up and do something in person, where I can focus on you and nothing else. Honestly, I can go a whole two years without seeing someone and still be able to pick up where we left off like it was just yesterday. 

I'm not saying no calling or text at all. I'm cool with short exchanges, but many keep trying to drag it tf out and give me crap for it every time I leave them on delivered just for a few hours. Long convos, where I have to stop everything I'm doing to look at a screen, ultimately leave me feeling irritated and suffocated to the point where I just stop replying for days. And they accuse me of ghosting and having commitment issues, and then they themselves abandon the friendship/relationship. It's a freaking cycle to the point where it's now a running joke in my family and friend circle that I'm a ghoster, that I struggle with commitment. ""she's always with a new friend/boyfriend.""

isfp,"There is someone I met online and I think they may be an ISFP. But I'm somewhat confused about them, I think I'll lay this out in a list.

2. Do you tend to copy the person's likes and dislikes and sometimes reply with general statements instead of sharing your own experiences (that's so annoying in fact) even if the other person has clearly opened up to you? I feel like they are kind of cautious and holding back even though they are warm and very interested in discussing things with me and also extremely observant. For some reason I worry they might use my admiration of them against me :(

3. Do you ever argue about life values and walk away/ feel irritated/ politely suggest changing the other person's point of view if they don't match with yours? Can you be blunt and brutally honest sometimes? Do you give unsolicited advice?",1610587762

isfp,"A very strange title here right? But let me explain.

When I was little I was shy and I passed days writing things on ""impulse"". I was very melancholic and I loved and dreams/nightmares.

When I grew up (about 13yo) I discovered I actually like to go out. Experiencing life out there. But it happened that I connected my melancholy to sensory object very often. It was like every place I visited was special in some way. I saw them with different eye. Also very common place became special to me. Touching the ground, rock, trees and Water make me feel good and charged. The sunlighr on me make me feel like a superman. I was shy, but I had these tension to live the moment, and I'm not talking about drinking etc., but just LIVING, walking, experiencing the vision of place and people. I love to meet new people.

But, life put me in a bad situation. I live in a town where I have no friends or opportunities. My only friends are 30km distant (and I can't see them very often). My problem is also that I don't like to communicate chatting: it's like I can't be myself when chatting, I feel bad at doing. So I close in my room, I play piano/bass, or try to compose music or write stories. 
When I write, I create most of all fantasy. I like to create an avatar of myself who can live a more active life than mine. 
In a moment I'm bored? I start imagining this character doing things, epic battles, others characters (who sometimes represent an aspect of me), or finding love (not only girlfriend, but sons etc and lost parentage).

This is enough to satisfy me? No, Se is made of sensory gratification, I suppose, so very often while doing art I go off, I loose inspiration and It's like I become another person, more pragmatic, who dislikes fantasy. People say I am probably INFP for my imagination, but here we are: I clash every INFP friends because they are too much in their world, while I prefer living my sensory life most. When I tell these things to them, they get me mad, so I don't know.

I feel like this could be an ISFP thing, because we are paradoxically described as being very chill people who don‚Äôt like confrontation but also as bundles of anger. 

And I think this is because maybe we started off being emotional in our childhood or teen years, but through reflection have learned to mellow out and not stress or care about dumb things. And I think this is why we look like we avoid conflict, because we‚Äôve probably gotten to a point that if we‚Äôre going to engage in conflict, it has to be for a very strong reason. 

So, sometimes I feel like I‚Äôm so mellow, that when I see someone being an inexcusable prick, I feel like if that brought that to me, I would feel so justified in unleashing all of my anger.

isfp,"Dear ISFPs of Reddit, 

I'm in a kind of unique situation with one ISFP man. We met less than two months ago when I moved to Istanbul. We hit it off right away, spent 7 days together and he asked me to move in since I'm supposed to stay for only 3 months. He was so excited about the idea and although I was hesitant (I already had my apartment, also I don't really know this guy) he managed to persuade me that it would be a good idea. And it was, we had so much fun, drinking, dancing, our sex is amazing and overall we connected on a different level. He opened up a couple of times, mostly when we were high. Other than that it's almost impossible to get him to talk about himself, but I didn't even try much and just acted silly altogether. New Year's Eve was awesome, he wanted to speak to my friends, told me he connected with me in a way he usually doesn't connect with other people and just asked to not fuck up whatever this is. We decided to stay friends, that he would visit me and that possibly we can travel around Turkey in summer. However, a couple of days ago I noticed that he started feeling a bit overwhelmed. Every time he shares about himself, I feel like he also takes a step back because he might be ashamed? Or maybe because he didn't mean everything he said? Anyway, I asked him directly and he told me that he still feels the same.  A couple of days ago I noticed he started feeling overwhelmed. Here in Turkey, we cannot go out on weekends and after 9pm, so for the past 6 weeks we have spent time together, pretty much all day every day. Yesterday, I wanted to talk openly about everything and he told me he just doesn't feel like he can do everything he wants when he's at home. He's been living alone for the past 10 years so this is a big change. I told him I could move and he wasn't opposed to the idea, but also didn't say directly he wanted me to move, he just said that I'm staying for one more month, so we can push ourselves to stay together a bit longer. I don't want to push myself and I don't want him to push himself. Recently he got gall stones, so his being sick is also bothering him a lot. I started looking for another apartment already and thinking about moving out since I don't want to be an inconvenience. Anyway, do you guys have any suggestions on what to do in this situation?

Thank you all so very much,

isfp,"So I‚Äôve been dating this ISFP for 3 or so weeks. He started the convo and has been very kind and great. Driving 2 hours to see me and memorizing everything about me. 

After the last date, which was very fun and he had a hard leaving it he wasn‚Äôt ready to plan another time just yet and gave me some excuses but was clear he was going to message me. That night he had a birthday party and I called late to say hi and he was like I‚Äôm still with my friend. And we‚Äôre having deep convo about my life. No big deal in my mind I kinda knew it was about his ex. He said he‚Äôd call the next morning.

Do note his ex and him broke up like 4 weeks ago and been dating for 2 years. 

When I just met him he ghosted me for 2 days when his ex showed up at Xmas and it fucked with him. He needed time alone to process this all. Then I texted him saying I was confused and I thought we had a good time. He responded and we planned our next date.

Back to the main story: he didn‚Äôt call the next morning. Or text. I texted him, it was very short answers like before and he wasn‚Äôt interested in texting obviously. I assumed he was in his feelings. I asked if he‚Äôd like to FaceTime later and he said yes. I called 2 times that night no response. Texted to make sure he‚Äôs okay. No response and I texted him again today asking what‚Äôs going on. And nothing. He is still browsing tinder as it said he‚Äôs online but he was doing that last time as well. I am too. I think he uses it as a coping mechanism because he‚Äôs hurting so much. 

That being said I know we shared a connection and he was very clear with me that he wouldn‚Äôt hurt me and our dialogue around that is very honest so I believe him. I don‚Äôt think he would intentionally hurt me. 

That being said I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the right time for us if he‚Äôs still healing and want to send him the following message and would like to see if you guys think this is good. It makes me so sad I have to do this but the relationship is just not 50/50 and from what I know he can do more than 50/50 he tried way harder than his ex in the last relationship. But I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs healed enough to do that for me. 

The text: 

Hey I know what you are probably going through with just breaking up has been rough. I would have much preferred if you would‚Äôve been direct since that‚Äôs what you would have wanted from your ex but I can see how you could be hurting and in your feelings and it‚Äôs making it hard to think of others. I thought what we shared was genuine. 

That being said when you are healed and want to reconnect I‚Äôm here and open to the possibility. 

Let me know if you think this is good. I would like to reconnect someday maybe if he‚Äôs healed enough to do so. 

Or if you think I should take a different route let me know.

isfp,"I have a heavy question for you. 
In which way ISFP considers, very often, himself to be special? 

I met tons of ISFP everyday. I find to be good with them because we communicate ""at hand"" (very easy), understanding each other. The problem comes when we define what consider ""individuality"".

All of them dress like: piercing, dark, same ""Pulp Fiction"" style, with cigarettes etc. Ok. They say I dress like a normie (because I'm always elegant, but not exaggerated in context). Still, other friends say I'm elegant/nice but in a different way because I mix colors (for exemple cremisi leather jacket and pure white shirt undert, with blue jeans). They say it's cool, ISFP says it's normie because I want to impress other (while I dress good because i like it).

They say they dress that way to distinguish theirselves. The problem?
The tons of people who actually are like them. In my town 6 girls on 10 dress that way. So, what's so special?

Also, they say I walk too good (""like a male model"") and prefer a ""bad boy"" walking. Well, ok. They complain because I don't like beer (I would drink if I like, but it's not the case) and cigarettes, calling me a child. I like 60-70-80 music (Pop/EDM/Rock/blues and others, well, I have not a single genre, but infinite vibes) and I dislike indie music -&gt; Not a good thing.

But from where it comes that individuality? If you behave like everyone out there, dress the same way etc?
I know, Se makes ISFP being more ""object-oriented"", rather that an INFP (who shapes his world from within), but I still think to be ISFP because I don't feel Si. I frequently brake rules and the schemes of action it's similiar to ISFPs I know (Actually, I always clash with INFP for some Se vs Si reasons. ALWAYS).

But what I feel it's from most of OTHER ISFP a close-mind too much dependance from other. So I ask you to clarify. Am I an ISFP or I'm a different ISFP from them? Or another Type? 
Why they don't see the omologations which is obvious? I would fear to resemble a stereotype that way.

I've strong imaginations, yes, but I like living in the moment most, breaking normal rules that for my ISTJ/INFP/ISFJ friends are holy (like being more ""action"" oriented, getting to know people easy putting me in opportunities). I'm very confused about it.
Also, I use a Ni approach to thing and very often it happens I predict events (but it's a remote usage of my mind). I use a lot Ni when I'm alone and can't experiencing Se, but when a Se opportunity pops up, I stop abstracting and start a Fi-Se immersion in things (this made these friends stand back everytime, sometimes looking bad ny actions).",1610196468

I just had one of the strangest interactions with him. I went over to his house so we could smoke and hang out as usual. He started talking about his new dog and how he was going to neuter him, which naturally led a discussion about the pros and cons of doing it.


It's always fun to have conversations and learning new things, but my friend was getting overly emotional (IMO) about it. I'm pretty neutral on the subject and asked him why he was neutering the dog (genuinely curious), and when I would ask questions about it he would get upset. 


He started sobbing and telling me I was a toxic person for never supporting him. He said I was purposely making him feel guilty about neutering his dog? I mean I see where he's coming from, but I had no intention of making him feel guilty or anything, I just wanted interesting discussion while we smoked.

Honestly I was kind of disturbed and asked if he was okay, which he lashed out ""STOP ASKING ME THAT"" and he just continued yelling at me. When I would try to explain myself about how I did not have any ill intentions, he would just interrupt me three words in. I told him I wouldn't talk anymore unless he would stop interrupting me, and he said okay, and then the very first thing he did was interrupt me again (not on purpose) and then he started laughing. It was a very strange and frustrating interaction. Especially throughout the convo, I constantly said I was being devil's advocate throughout and made it clear I was neutral about the subject. 


I noticed a pattern that he constantly thinks other people have the absolute worst intentions against him. I feel like he is overly sensitive, because it's not normal to start crying in a normal discussion where we were just gonna chill (which he called an ""argument"" but I thought it was just a normal convo until he exploded). He also constantly puts words in my mouth -- I would say one thing, but he interprets it in the worst way possible and then tries to say that those were my words).



Like I'm trying to be open minded here. I can see what he's saying about not being completely supportive, but I think that's something a normal person shouldn't really get upset over. He keeps calling me toxic, but I feel like I'm being manipulated into thinking stuff is always my fault. Does this sound like an unhealthy ISFP, or do you think I'm in the wrong?",1610080500

Donald Trump is a SEE/ESFP in reverse development with main enneagram 8w7. NiTe subego (channelling Ni inspirations with Te methodics) pushed by a submerged Se Base frame. Fi fixation.

IRL dimensionality of valued functions:4D Base: Se (submerged), 3D Primary Auxiliary: Te (surfacing), 2D Secondary Auxiliary: Ni (surfaced), 1D Acting Suggestive: Fi (submerging)

On practical terms the resulting behaviour is an hybrid between SEE/ESFP and LIE/ENTJ. His strong tendencies of shaming and guilting others are an unhealthy expression of Fe Demonstrative. On top of that he has NPD.

Reversion is often triggered by trauma, depression and/or drug abuse. I suspect that in the case of Trump it was the latter to trigger the above reversion.

If you think that you can just cage the fluidity of human psyche in 16 boxes of stereotypes with all people following the same specific steps in development... And call it a day... You're delusional and you're vastly understimating the human psyche.

I‚Äôve been having a hard time not feeling jealous of these traits.

He takes in her appearance somewhat when he sits down, and notices that she is conventionally attractive even though she is dressed down (though this is not important to him - helping her feel better is his goal.) He asks her politely what is wrong, and listens to her carefully along the way even though she is listing off ways in which she has been selfish (and even though she is what some may think of as whiney and annoying,) as he understands that she is remorseful and feels that she is putting too much blame on herself. He notices that she mentions that she does not have anyplace to stay due to tension with her parents, and although he is somewhat hesitant, offers to let her stay with him even though he has just moved into the city because he wants to help her get her life back to a steady place, and has been in a position before himself in which he felt terribly hopeless, and would not wish the same on anyone else, especially not a woman who seems to be sweet in spite of her flaws. He orders coffee for the woman and himself (though he does ask her what she would like,) and actually does move her into his new home, (he has just moved into the city for a new job,)and allows her to stay rent-free whilst she works on finding a job.

He lets her stay with him even after she has found a job, in part due to having developed an affection for her, in part due to simply being a nice guy, and in part due to understanding based upon their conversations (though he does not directly question her about her family, he simply listens when she talks about them... the woman in question is chatty when in a good mood,) that her tensions with her family members continue. He ends up allowing this woman's younger sister to stay with them as well, even though he finds her younger sister bossy and rude, because he has heard about her younger sister, and understands that even though she is a bit unlikeable, she has never had any positive role models in her life - he also understands that mending her familial relationship with her younger sister is very important to the woman he took in, and thereby lets her younger sister stay even though she is rude.

IT SUCKS. IMO the best way for me to get my feelings ""out"" is when I write or make something meaningful *to me* but I would rather pluck out my lashes than share it with others

isfp,"Don't get me wrong, I'm not questioning whether or not I'm an ISFP, I know I am. I just feel like I don't relate to the stereotypes of an ISFP sometimes, and that's because people can't be categorizes 100% by just 16 types. I like to throw enneagram into the mix just to see what a person's focus is on as well. That being said, as an ISFP 6, I care a lot about certainty and hate when I don't know what's going on. I feel like my Ni is strong and my Se is weaker due to the fact I can hyperfocus so much on unrealistic futures. I basically use my Se is a more mellow way I guess. My Fi just happens to value plenty of things most ISFJs value as well.


So here's a few examples. I really don't mind the idea of having a stable life. All I want is to have a nice place to live and a nice house, to be safe and content. I really dislike where I spend my time. At my house, I've got people that rarely ever say a word to each other and only bicker every once in a while, then at my bf's house they're always screaming and yelling, the house is always filthy and there's animals everywhere. Its so much anxiety for me and the idea of having a loving and stable household makes me happy.


Another thing I can't stand is when people are rude for no reason. I hate when people don't have the decency to just be nice at face value at the very least. But I get really hurt when I come across rude behavior.


I'm not here to get told I'm not an ISFP because I'm not crazy and spontaneous, trust me I used to be. I've just learned a lot from that. This is just my two cents about how we all can have attitudes or personality traits from other types.",1609534508

isfp,"My ninety year old demented grandmother on hospice lives under my care and has started refusing to take the pharmacopoeia of old people pills required to pretty much keep her alive at this point.

It puts me in a moral quandary because I‚Äôm an advocate of people‚Äôs decision to die if their quality of life is as bad as hers (can‚Äôt eat, sit, move hardly at all, much less walk or go to the bathroom or anything) but there‚Äôs also the question of whether someone who isn‚Äôt in their right mind is capable of understanding the consequences of such a serious decision...and then of course, there are my own personal issues I deal with, like taking pride in a task I‚Äôve undertaken as well as loving my grandmother and being attached to her for the person she used to be (a wonderfully loyal and independent ESTJ) and wanting to be dutiful to her because she deserves it.

Consequently, this has led me to following nurses‚Äô advice to put her medicine in ice cream, which I then allow my ISFP daughter to feed her, because my grandmother is more likely to behave for my daughter (apparently people with dementia often give their primary caregiver a harder time, as they decline mentally, than they do everyone else.)

Anyway I‚Äôm mixing pulverized pills into her ice-cream while my young daughter watches me, and she says: ‚ÄúMom, have you ever spiked anyone else‚Äôs food or drink?‚Äù

And I immediately kick into full-blown ISFP mode like, ‚ÄúABSOLUTELY NOT. From a legal standpoint, you would get in a lot of trouble for doing something like that, but even if it wasn‚Äôt illegal, it‚Äôs morally reprehensible to violate someone else by allowing them to ingest something you gave them without their permission or their knowledge!‚Äù

Then I launch into all the ways I disapprove of similar behavior, like kids putting a bug or spit in their friend‚Äôs sandwich when they aren‚Äôt looking, and I work my way up to teenage girls at frat parties and bars being rufied as soon as they turn their eyes from their drink.

As her eyes get wider and wider, I explain how your body is really the only thing in this world that YOU have and that is yours alone. Your house, car, possessions, even friends, relationships, and reputation can always be taken away from you in the blink of an eye, but if you cannot exercise freedom over your own body and control what happens to it, or goes into it, ‚Äúthat is truly a huge tragedy.‚Äù

As I hand her the bowl and see the weight of my words sink in, I feel a bit guilty for dropping too much truth on her at her age, so I attempt to lighten the mood by saying, ‚Äúwelp, happy new year!‚Äù and smiling with my eyebrows raised. 

She grins really big and says, ‚ÄúHappy New Year mom! Time go drug Granny!!‚Äù and walks off after giving me an amused look.

He is insecure about his intelligence (he has a bit of an Inferiority Complex, even at his rather young age,) and hesitates a bit when answering questions due to this, even though it is clear to an outsider that he is actually very smart, and he scores quite high on tests/receives good grades in school and understands what is being taught in class. He has actually received the offer of skipping a grade from his teachers, but still feels that he is not actually smart and is aware that those around him expect him to be due to the reputation that his mother and older siblings have. He is already curious/inquisitive, but actually takes his mother up on her offer of checking out books for him on different subjects, and takes the time to learn about different concepts even at his young age due to his insecurity. He spends a good amount of his time reading, and is actually knowledgeable on a number of different topics. Even though he is logical, he is actually quite good at empathizing with others and does understand how they feel, though he feels awkward about giving advice.

He had an existential crisis at the age of eight, though nothing particularly sparked this ‚Äì he had just been by himself in his room, thinking about the people around him and the concept of death. He understood that he would eventually die, as would his parents, siblings, and even the people who he attended school with‚Ä¶ he still struggles with this when it comes to mind on occasion, as he does not think that the existence of a God makes logical sense, and yet understands why other people would want to believe in one. He becomes a bit depressed when he thinks about it for too long.

He actually does have a desire to make friends and fit into social groups/be accepted amongst other people, but a bit awkward and withdrawn. He has been bullied by his peers a bit due to his quiet personality, but does want to make friends. Can actually succumb a bit to peer pressure/be susceptible to it. He is actually better at reading people than he gives himself credit for being, and is observant of group dynamics. He is certainly reserved, but does make an effort to talk to people (the kids in his grade can be a bit mean, so this does not always work out.) He is actually quite polite, as he does understand basic social norms (though more than anything, is empathetic/does not want to make the people around him feel bad about themselves,) though his nervous energy is what leads to him being a bit awkward in social settings.

He is quite aware of the strengths/talents his family members happen to have, and feels that he is inferior in comparison, though he does not necessarily envy them for this, nor is he rude to them because of it; for example, he sees that his older siblings are popular in school and that his father has great social skills ‚Äì he feels bad about being a bit socially awkward in comparison, and feels on some level as though he should be the same. He feels as though he is not living up to what those around him (his peers, people who know his parents and siblings,) expect him to be, and feels bad about this. He knows that he comes off as less confident than his siblings and parents do, though he hopes that he will gradually develop a sense of confidence as he grows older, as he knows that it would help his peers feel less comfortable with walking over him. He senses/is aware that his father feels as though he does not quite understand him, and feels guilty about this as well. He is creative, and certainly does have an imagination. He is good at explaining concepts to other people in a way that they can understand, and is undoubtedly the best at doing this of his siblings, even though he does not have much faith in his ability to do so.

I am an INFJ who wants to better understand my little sister (11 years younger) who I think (and she agrees) is an ISFP.

She is quick to notice a change in physical appearance in someone else, or physical details (for example, she will compliment someone on a new outfit, notices when someone has changed their beard or eyebrows, etc.)

She struggled with confidence issues/low self-esteem and shyness when she was a bit younger, much like her little brother is now, but she grew to be more confident during her later years of elementary school and realized that she needed to maintain a certain level of self-respect in order to avoid being bullied/put down by others, and that she would truly feel happy and fulfilled if she were able to start thinking more about her positive traits and stop being bothered by what she was unable to fix. She is not as naturally driven as her older brother is in regards to taking a ton of advanced placement classes and being an overachiever, although she maintain a good GPA/good grades in school, as she does listen to her mother and is aware that college is becoming more and more competitive. She does not know what she wants to do with her life, though she is not bothered by this, as she knows that she will eventually figure things out, and in the meantime prefers to chill out with friends and enjoy living her life. She can struggle with completing her assignments on time, even though she is smart and does usually understand the work - her mother typically helps her out with this. She knows what her flaws are in regards to her appearance, and in general, though either jokes about them or works on herself.

She can actually be a bit socially awkward from time to time, but she is very good at saving herself/saving the moment from being too awkward when this does happen, typically by making a joke.

isfp," When this girl was very young, she overheard her maternal grandparents mention in conversation that her mother was initially uncertain about giving birth to her due to having become pregnant whilst young and unwed. This led to her feeling worthless at an early age, and wondering if she was truly worth giving birth to... she feels as though her existence must have made things difficult for her mother, and feels like a burden. Although she does hear it when young, this conversation ultimately becomes a big part of her life - she remembers it forever, and thinks about it even in her teen years (of course, she does not remember the exact wording, but rather remembers the gist of it,) and this shapes many things about her. She urgently wants her mother's love; although her mother does love her and tries to tell her so, her mother still critiques her clothing and other things about her, leading to some resentment, and she feels/perceives based upon observation, or rather gets the sense that, her mother prefers her younger sister to her. She argues with her mother from time to time in regards to what has already been mentioned due to having such intense feelings, and yet wants badly to be talented and ‚Äúgood‚Äù at something so that her mother will see that she was worth having.

She tries her hand at different things, but can‚Äôt seem to succeed in any particular area. She does not perform well in school due to likely having an undiagnosed learning disability and feels that she is stupid, even though her parents encourage her to keep on trying. She is not physically attractive (she is slightly overweight, and cannot lose weight even when she tries to diet due to her father‚Äôs genetics,) and is not all that facially attractive either ‚Äì she is average looking to some, and below average looking to others. She cannot act, nor perfect public speaking, due to having stage fright, even though she does try. She is not particularly innovative or creative even though she is capable of understanding the bigger picture. She has friends, yet she is not popular, and often sits by herself at lunch, depressed (in fact, some of her peers tease her for being over-dramatic and emotional ‚Äì they find it ridiculous of her to be the way she is, as she has more money than a lot of kids in the neighborhood.) She spends a fair amount of her time, whenever she is not trying to perfect something that may, in her eyes, lead to her winning her mother's adoration and approval for once and for all, beating herself up over past mistakes and feeling bad about things that she has done and said... for example, she is sometimes mean to her little sister due to feeling jealous of her for being the child that she \*suspects\* her mother prefers, yet simultaneously understands that her sister is young and that this is not actually her fault, and feels guilty for arguing with her mother, as she understands that her mother gave up a lot just to have her (she feels like even more of a burden when she thinks about this.) In spite of her great want to be successful in order to make her mother proud, she cannot actually seem to succeed in any area or walk of life. She is quite aware of this, and it makes her even more depressed‚Ä¶

She feels that her father is the only person who happens to understand her, as he can relate to her weight and depression issues, and always listens to her, even when she has locked herself inside of her room during a family outing.

isfp," See a woman in a coffee shop who is crying and quite clearly depressed, and sit down with her before ordering something for himself even though he has somewhere else to be due to empathizing with her and wanting to help/know what's wrong (he does recognize that she is pretty/conventionally attractive, but that is not the driving reason in regards to him sitting down.) He does directly ask her if she is alright, and even though she begins to dramatically list off reasons as to why she is not, he still patiently/carefully listens without speaking, and learns that she is not returning home due to tensions with her parents, and that her younger sister has run away. Although her situation is ""heavy"" so to speak, he still urgently wants for her to feel better, as he understands that what she is going through must undoubtedly be difficult, and was depressed for a few years himself - although he is a bit hesitant to do so, he offers to let her stay with him, as he truly does want her to feel better/have a place to live in and thinks that he can help her mend her relationship with her parents and younger sister, or at least assist in the process. He buys her coffee as well even without her asking (though he does check to see what she likes,) and follows through on his offer to let this stranger stay with him after hearing about her situation (i.e. she does end up actually staying with him, which is a bit uncomfortable for him as he is introverted, but he figures that he himself will get used to it and wants her to feel comfortable in the meantime.) He allows her to stay with him without paying rent whilst she finds a job, although he has just moved into the city himself. Who would do this?

isfp," When in school, this guy was a bully (however, his bark was usually worse than his bite,) though he was masking his own multitude of insecurities. Despite his frequent posturing, he was a bit of a crybaby, and was easily frightened and/or upset easily. He would often gloat of his own intellectual or physical superiority, though another person would easily show him up. He has always been overweight, and even in adulthood, struggles with eating a lot (though he has improved as he has grown older.) He did not perform well academically when he was in school due to having deep rooted insecurities (he had been called dumb frequently by his peers due to having been held back in school, and mostly gave up on himself... though he did manage to start performing incredibly well academically once after a test mix-up that suggested he was a genius, indicating that his inability to believe in himself was the cause of his low scores as opposed to actually being dumb.) He begun smoking marijuana in high school to have fun with/fit in with friends, but felt immensely guilty after being caught, sent to the school office, and his mother being called about him smoking, leading to him working on finding a job to clean up his act/grow up a bit. He found a job at a butcher shop. Although his ""friends"" tried pressuring him into continuing to smoke with them, he found that he enjoyed his job at the butcher shop, learning to help make meat and different foods - he hated being cast out by his friends and did feel a bit conflicted, but remained loyal to his employer and actually worked hard at his job. He also made an effort to improve his grades and did so (whilst they were not straight A's, he had enough credits to graduate from high school) and although he was unsure as to what he wanted to do after high school, continued working in the butcher shop and realized that it was truly the job for him. He ended up maturing quite a bit over the years and was eventually promoted to butcher shop manager due to his dedication/loyalty to the job. He also reunited with an old fling shortly before his promotion and found that there was still a level of mutual attraction present - he did end up getting her pregnant, but raised the baby with her even though her parents did not like him (this bothered him a bit,) and saved up money from his job in the meantime to marry her (they ended up having another daughter a few years later.) He is quite understanding in regards to his children, and not hard on them at all - in fact, he is rather soft on them, and the only one in the house who can make his eldest daughter feel better, as he understands her troubles with her weight and empathizes with her in spite of the fact that she does not get along with his wife.

isfp," This guy is a successful salesman - he is successful in part due to his great interpersonal skills (he is charismatic and you sense when speaking to him that he wants to get to know you, even though he is making a sale,) and his ambition (he has always wanted to be financially stable due to wanting to live a gratifying life without having to worry about money - his father often spoke about saving money when he was growing up - and he is partly ambitious due to wanting to help his wife out in providing for their three children. He does not want them to be too spoiled, and knows that his wife works hard in regards to her own job, but understands that it takes two great incomes to maintain their home and help pay for what their kids need. He genuinely cares about his wife and supporting her, as he sees her hard work and partly works so hard in regards to his own job to lend her a helping hand, and to ensure that he is a good role model for his own children.) He always likes to ensure that he knows at least a bit about a product before he tries selling it to be safe/avoid feeling anxious, though he has been able to sell products in the past even when he did not know a great deal about the product due to his aforementioned charisma (he can honestly be a \*bit\* manipulative when selling products, but not in a malicious way in the slightest...)

His social skills help him out a great amount in regards to his job as a salesman; he has always been popular amongst groups of people, even going back as far as elementary school - he aimed to be popular in elementary school as he felt in his household that since he was the middle child, his spotlight was stolen by his older brother, or his younger sister. He aimed to be known for being ""cool"" and him being so personable led to him being voted in class president against the richest girl in school. He did enjoy hearing gossip (and still does, honestly,) but does not necessarily partake in it (i.e. he does not really speak negatively about other people unless he dislikes someone - and he is honest about it when he dislikes people, though not too blunt - but he does enjoy hearing about the business of others from friends.) Although he has never been what some would consider to be dumb, he maintained average grades whilst in elementary and middle school due to not having a serious interest in the subject matter - however, since he ended up dating (and later on marrying,) the smartest girl in his grade (he was interested in her due to her being pretty, kind, and finding her intelligence attractive... he liked that she was always helping he and other people out, yet also capable of solving nearly any problem,) he asked her in high school to help him raise his grades, as he understood that he needed to start maintaining higher grades in order to start seriously looking at a career (he also saw his girlfriend succeeding academically and wondered, on some level, why he deserved her. He wanted to be the guy that she deserved to have, or at least this was how he thought of it, and also wanted to help himself out career-wise.)

He actually committed to raising his grades with her help, even though it was difficult at first to maintain a consistent studying routine as he always wanted to sit down and relax after school, or head out with some friends. He had always maintained a healthy romantic relationship with her even whilst dating due to being willing to talk out different issues with her (she had to start the conversation, but he was open to it and willing to listen, as he really did want to make things work.) He did end up attending a good school in regards to college due to his dedication, and even though he did care for her, he and his aforementioned girlfriend agreed to break off their relationship for a little while due to attending different schools (he was upset about this, but tried dating two other people in college, as did she... only to find that it didn't ""feel the same"" and that he missed her too much. She would later on report feeling the same.) After graduating, he re-connected with his former girlfriend due to understanding based upon his other two relationship experiences that she was his best match (and hoping that she still felt the same - she did!)

He found his first sales job through a social connection (through a buddy of his,) as he ensured that he networked throughout college (partly due to his aspirations, and this was partly natural - he is the kind of person who would have made connections no matter what school he went to,) and although he did have some fun as he learned more about the sales world, he still made sure to take his job seriously, as he knew that he wanted a future with his girlfriend and financial stability. He moved up in the ranks due to his social skills and interest in improving at the job, and married his girlfriend - he, of course, begun to work harder and harder after their kids were born. However, he recalled his own father having been a workaholic, and feeling that he didn't get to know him as well as he could have due to this (and feeling that his father was boring and only ever rambled about money); for this reason, although he makes sure that he establishes boundaries with his kids (he, along with his wife, encourages them to maintain at least average grades in school and undoubtedly parents them,) he still successfully gets to know his children as people and pays attention to them. He has a genuine relationship with each of his children, and even though he can be direct with them at times, is loved by them - he is usually understanding of their feelings, yet does not tolerate disrespect from them toward he or his wife and is clear about this.

She is known for being one of the most, if not the most, intelligent women in the city she lives in (she had grown up there, even though she was born in another state and lived elsewhere whilst attending college,) and was class valedictorian in high school due to her academic prowess (she has always been competitive in regards to academics, and was a typical ""good student"" whilst in school - had perfect attendance every year except one, always scored high on tests, maintained the highest GPA of any student in the school in her high school and even before that, won the ""Student of the Year"" award multiple times, etc.) She struggled with being a people-pleaser and pushover when young due to naturally being nice (though she was devious enough to go along with/assist in her best friend's pranks, even though some of their classmates were not,) and having some self-esteem issues, but started to steadily become more confident in middle school and high school. She has always been confident in regards to her logical conclusions, though, as she has always understood that she is smart, and prided herself on being known as ""the smart one"" amongst her peers. She was a very high-achieving student in high school with great extracurriculars and grades - although she considered a few different paths, she ultimately decided that she wanted to study neuroscience due to feeling that the area was a perfect intersection of the physical and the abstract, in addition to wanting to learn more about biology/the human brain and feeling that the field had the potential to transform human health (she also realized in her sophomore year that she tended to dedicate a fair amount of time to reading about the brain and its functions, even though she did read up on a great number of other subjects.)

She attended a top school and graduated as one of the first in her class there due to her dedication to studying the topic - she met up with the guy who she had dated for many years from elementary school to high school (who is the extroverted salesman that she is married to,) and begun dating him again, as although she tried dating someone else (as did he,) in university, she found that there had not been the same level of comfort and understanding as there had been in her relationship with him. They ended up marrying and she had three children with him, though she ensured that she found work before she became pregnant, and begun a savings account with her husband in order to make sure that their kids would have college funds/enough money in general. As a mother, she is great, even though she did have some concerns about her potential parenting - she is self-aware in regards to most mistakes that she may be making/have made as a parent, but is actually a very good mother. She ensures that her kids maintain at least average grades in school (she is not too hard on them about this, though she is still clear about her expectations,) and that they are actively learning - she encourages them to read, introduces and encourages different kinds of learning styles, brings in game-based learning, etc. She does want them to maintain good grades, as she does think about their futures and wants to set the kids onto a path of success in the world (though she understands that it is about more than simply ending up with a high-paying job, and does not pressure them into choosing a certain career, but rather tries to help them explore different options and encourage them to move toward what they are actually interested in,) but is also concerned about them actually learning, and keeps a library of books in the house. She is very well-read on important aspects of a child's development, and also encourages a healthy social life amongst her kids, making sure that they have friends and understand social etiquette. She likes to keep a schedule, but is still willing to move along when things do not go according to plan, even though it can make her a bit uncomfortable/anxious.

She is conventionally attractive, and aware of this - she styles herself in a certain way due to understanding that as a woman, she is being judged by many based upon her physical appearance (she will begin talking about the Halo Effect and different studies when her children ask,) and encourages all of her children to be well-groomed/take care of their physical appearance for this reason (particularly her daughter, as she knows that it will be more important for her, but she is not nitpick-y in regards to her children's appearances, and simply encourages them to look presentable whilst also encouraging them to not be shallow.) She does know how to set healthy boundaries in regards to her children. She is usually the person who cooks for the family (she sets a specific time for this,) and particularly makes healthy foods, as she finds it important based upon her readings for the people in the house to have a balanced diet (they complain about this, though she lets them order takeout from time to time.) She is usually patient with her children, and even though they do not always show their appreciation for her, they undoubtedly love and value her.

isfp,"I love the whole mbti thing tbh.I am confused tho cuz i ended up not knowing my actual type and functions bcz i feel some extroverted and introverted functions are equally strong so here's everything about me;

I am the typical happy go lucky kid and ppl dont realize that i can be deep and smart which is a typical enfp thing.But that s not the whole case.I am like that but only with ppl i trust .  To strangers i still act kinda weird but i can be really awkward.I hate small talk,public speaking and parties..I dont like meeting new people and i am really bad at making new friends/dont want to. I rarely trust people.For an enfp im kind of a pessimist.I love the comfort of routine.Adventures seem fine but like...im okay with visiting the beach and i would love a bonefirr and star gazing but bunjee jumping or extreme sports?nahhh

I'm a really logical person,but i make decisions based on my feelings bcz i just cant contain emotions inside me.I am definately a feeling type.But i dont know if fe&gt;fi.I overshare my emotions with ppl online but i rarely open up to ppl i dont know,I try to maintain peace(got punched bcz i tried to stop two friends fighting)(fe)but when an injustice happens in a word fight i support who is right(fi)

I am the kind of person who loves exploring(want to travel a lot and explore places in my town,take pics n all)and visiting other places but i cant see myself leaving behind my place and the ppl i love for a prosperus life.I am also really introspective, i wanna know who I am my purpose if is there any and HOW CAN I CHANGE THE WORLD(Thats ne i think).I lack ni function tho.I cant foresee the future or now things out of the blue.I tend to think what will happen if i do this for example but thats just overthinking

ti is analyzing.Kinda good at that.Te is effectivness/execution/organizing.Very bad at that(Dont know if te is inferior function or the demon of shadow function)

Si vs Se oh boy.I am good at collecting memories and i value that a lot.I love collecting memories and moments.(si).On the other hand...my senses are veeery strong.Now  i know se is all about living in the moment but its also using us senses.When im out enjoying the moment i can forget the trouble im in...but sometimes i can just sense  smthn is not right

I dislike;people invading in my personal space and altering it,close minded people,the repetition of phrases,sounds etc and telling me what to do or how to express my self(write like this,dress like that,walk this way,talk that way).And for the love of God don't interupt me when i think

i value;honesty,chill ppl and i love intelligent ppl

isfp,"It's normal to ISFP getting in something he knows it can't last?

I have this problem. Me (maybe ISFP) and a girl (ISFP) saw eachother and istantly phisically and vibing ""liked"", I found her on facebook and we dated (she was very happy). After the first date she bacame a bit cold and answers to my mex after days (ok, this one is a normal thing, she did it also when we chat before the date, but she was happier before).

I know she wants her spaces (normal for some ISFP) and I could accept it if I knew what were her intentions to me. 

But, we are also very different in lifestyle. She is more like a rebel melancholic smoking girl who claims to be unique, while I'm more a career oriented and I need something settled (despite it's not my main concern), and rationality says to me to not continue this thing, because she's not my type. 
But dunno, my feelings drive me too much. 

So, I did it: I broke the ""Se"" wall (?). I asked her directly if she is still interested in knowing me, because this thing has to be a pleasure for both of us (not only for me). So if she doesn't want to continue, she can explicit say it to me. I said it very quietly and I also said I would accept any decision, it's only I want to know first. I feel this kind of thing could scare a person like her (who feel rebel/free), but personally I couldn't stand that situation.

Still I'm sad because I don't even know if she will reply, but at the same time I know she is not the girl for me (And I also know I like girls very easily because of my gut istinct in the moment). It's not I will not find other girls, but for some reason I'm too concerned in her because I live more the moment than the future. 

How can I stop this and concern in my future?",1608976411

isfp,"Hi everyone, I would like to have an idea what type I could be... 

So, I am certain that I am Fi-Te but just not very sure if my axis(?) functions is Se-Ni or Ne-Si. 

I am in my early thirties and could be an extremely unhealthy ISFP looping in Fi-Ni for some time now and appearing like an INFP...

‚Ä¢ My Fi has probably matured and mellowed out over the course of the years (hard cringe in reflection)...I used to be extremely self-righteous and judgmental/intolerant of the differences in one‚Äôs life choices; imposing my morals onto other people (interestingly enough, I'm not religious). I was very reactive and would get confrontational if someone crosses my values...would even go as far to lecture/shame them for their 'questionable' morals/values. I also used to be very hard/strict on myself to uphold a certain ‚Äògoodness‚Äô and do the ‚Äòright thing‚Äô attitude. Now I am able to see more of the grey areas and okay with it.


‚Ä¢ I suppress and neglect my Se probably more than I should...I can‚Äôt engage it for too long because it is very draining (I‚Äôm highly sensitive to external stimuli...I'm always the one ducking out early at parties/big groups). And if I do, I can overindulge and go too far, lost in it until I realize I have a problem/addiction. I have a general awareness of my immediate surroundings and notice more of the energy/vibe/mood first before taking in the external stimuli (how the room smells/sounds/looks is secondary). I am really into aesthetics and fashion but think it's just too much effort to achieve and re-create it. Also I never ""do"" anything...the thought of going for a hike on trails/run already drains me for some reason (maybe there‚Äôs a lot pre-planning involved for it...) even though I really love the idea of going camping and hiking, taking in nature... But I take short strolls and have to take lot of breaks to sit down so I could enjoy nature and daydream. 

‚Ä¢ To be honest,  I do not have a full understanding of what Si is... but maybe this is related...I have very oddly specific obsessions (it could take a turn and fall into the morbid if I don‚Äôt catch myself). I used to be a hoarder. I also went through phases of obsession with various historic eras/alternative universes and romanticized how it would be like living in that period (I fantasize how my boyfriend and I would met in our past and future lives...which is pointless but an epic love story in my mind lol) I am extremely nostalgic and sentimental...I find it extremely hard to let go of the latter and would keep/use it even if it's broken/un-glamourous. Very prone up bring up things/stories of the past (or otherwise imagined). I want to relive the golden parts of my childhood...but I have the worst memory and cannot recall the small details, like the facts and figures, at all. 


‚Ä¢ I don‚Äôt really relate with Ne;  I am absolutely terrible considering the possibilities/not good at seeing situations from all angles. I usually already have made a conclusion and stick with it. I draw a completely blank when I have to provide alternative examples of something, specially to elaborate my point; even worse with explaining things. But I can see the other side of an argument and tend to debate against it, I enjoy it just for the mental exploration/speculation. I also enjoy word play/puns and make these vague connection to things that seems reminds me of something (it makes me seem like I have ADHD and go off tangents). Sometimes I read too much into things when there is none. I enjoy novelty a lot and like to change up on things. I cannot stick with a consistent routine and pretty flexible it plans changes (depends). Alternatively, I really like my comfort zone and can have a hard time adjusting to things that are unfamiliar to me. 

‚Ä¢ I feel like my Ni has given me a sense of self-awareness. With age, I have gotten better at seeing the grand scheme of things and how everything is interconnected with one other. I am drawn to the curiosities of life. Also very interested in philosophy, psychology and spirituality. I love to dig deeper and get to the core/root of things/issues. Can get very obsessed with insights/figuring the whys, and discovering the 'truths' of the universe. When I find a topic of interest, I can get addicted to hoarding information because my mind is weird and wants to analyze patterns/solve some on missing link to whatever theory I had in the moment..

‚Ä¢ My Te is no doubt my weakest function and the most insecure of all insecurities, I fall short on efficiency and it hurts so much..I was absolutely convinced that I was stupid as a child because to this day, I still rely on a calculator to do basic math :X ...I am kind of more familiar with Ti (since I feel like it‚Äôs very similar to Fi) and seem to understand how Ti users process their thoughts. Similarly, I question everything but nowhere as natural (I ask all the wrong questions lol) but I do try to create my own framework by destructing an idea...

So, thoughts? Any ISFPs or INFPs find any of this relatable at all? 

Oh yeah, I know that we are all unique individuals and the MBTI is meant to be used as a guideline. Also I have spend some time studying the cognitive function and have a basic understanding of it (please feel free to provide further reading of it if applicable).

isfp,"Ok so lately I've been having a semi identity crisis when it comes to mbti. I truly thought I was an ISFP for a long while until I started to really think about it and some of the isfp traits did not resonate with me at all. 

Now in order to get an accurate idea about me, I need to reveal some stuff.

I used to suffer from depression and serious anxiety which lasted for 4 yrs (I got professional help which helped me so much) but now I would say I'm myself again. Before those 4yrs I used to be seriously extroverted, I loved hanging out with people, going on stage, doing presentations in large crowds and I would be the one going up and randomly making friends. Now after those 4yrs, I'm like that again and I really don't resonate with the whole shy and wanting to be alone ISFP or just introvert part as much (I did during those 4yrs). I do still like my alone time but I feel more exhausted from being alone too much and need to engage with people like my family or text my friends. 

When I was talking to my friend (who is an infp and knows mbti) about this, she said that I definitely seemed more extroverted. So I started researching about cognitive functions and I honestly found it a bit  confusing specifically figuring out my dominant functions (I'm so indecisive its embarrassing).

I'm always the one initiating conversations with people because I hate waiting for others to come talk to me. I'm in the moment but I do also fantasise about possible futures (which sometimes are based on reality). I procrastinate like crazy and get distracted by things so easily omg. I love talking to people...just talking in general honestly. I'm not artistic or have a knack for art but I do draw from time to time. I always have to be doing something. Even when I'm sitting down in a class or something, my hands is always playing with a pen/my feet are swaying (I'm kinda short so that helps). I would say I'm a bit logical but I definitely am more intune with my feelings much more. I get lost in thought quite easily and always have some random song in my head, promoting me to be humming randomly. 

I don't have anything else to say really but I would seriously love to know what people think because I'm so lost at the moment and would love to know what you all think. I'm open to any questions too.",1608868236

isfp,"I want to understand if this is an example of ISFP/INFP clash or behaviour differences. I think I'm ISFP and this happens with all my INFP friends:

- Both are idealistic, but ISFP could be more tyrannical with too much stress (they call it the ENTJ shadow?), while in stress INFP could be less aggressive and prone to a kind of imobilization, without seeking nothing particular (or sometimes, waiting for other ""returns"")

- Both like art, but INFP sometimes likes more details in general, sometimes a detail an ISFP could consider ""strange"" to pick up respect to the whole opera (not saying it's negative or positive thing, but INFPs is way more subjective?); ISFP show more how things work to form the general vibe of an opera, while INFP works more on the detail itself sometimes detatched from the general vibe (this is what I spot reading the story of my friends); in both case, people can create unique and different arts (not saying one it's better).

- INFP can live too much in the past and convinctions regarding his behaving. He has fear to act out of the  general ""rules"", while ISFP, remaining loyal to his Fi, search for opportunities in not conventional way, and sometimes INFPs could fear this ""bravery"", or call it a bit ""mad"".

- INFP could be more close to a vision of himself who comes from himself and it's hard to change. Changes regarding his Si experience, which are more ""introvert"" and not expansive. ISFP on the other hand can change experiencing more opportunities to seek and discovery what he likes (doesn't like too much schemes), more a Se oriented apporach, still keeping their personal Fi, whom is build in this method;

- INFPs could be less prone to accept an event, while an ISFP can accept in toto what happened with time and turn page with decision. INFPs still are a lot loyal, while the vision of life of the ISFP can change so drastically that can put him to make changes in his life very quickly (and sometimes regrets will come);

- INFP likes more to ""compete"" in a visible way (telling you they want to compete), while ISFP could compete without showing to care too much (but they actually do).

- Both likes 1 to 1 talks, but ISFPs could be more in tune with the general vibe of the group, sometimes in a natural way, while INFPs have a more unique approach to groups (negativo or positive, sometimes they could be seen too much weird or out of context).

isfp,"\- He‚Äôs quiet, stoic, blunt, sarcastic, and poker-faced. He can take some jokes too far such as making fat jokes. 

\- Likes playing video games, watching action anime, reading manga, cosplay, drawing, joined robotics and chess club, and relaxing at home doing nothing. He was obsessed with chess and won everyone in every game. Whenever there was free time in class, he would ask me to play against him even though he knew I‚Äôm not good at it.

\- He‚Äôs lazy, slow moving, gets average grades, and doesn't like working. 

\- He wanted to major in comp science but accidentally applied as a marketing major, so he kept the major even though he doesn't know what he wants to do with it. 

\- He‚Äôs present-oriented and doesn't plan anything. For example a lot of people plan their college schedules but he just chooses classes off of time and uses a random class generator that creates schedules for him.

\- Often asks ‚Äúwhat's the point?‚Äù for many things. An example is when I used barbeque sauce for my broccoli. He asked this question because he didn‚Äôt see what the point of making a healthy food turn unhealthy was. Another example of when he asked this question was when he found out I work and don‚Äôt spend a penny. He mentioned saving money without purchasing anything is pointless so he intentionally browses for things to buy even though he has nothing in mind he actually wants to purchase. 

\- He‚Äôs observant when it comes to things like noticing stuff about friends‚Äô personality traits and he can usually tell if someone is pretending to laugh at another person‚Äôs jokes. However he‚Äôs not observant of his surroundings because he won‚Äôt notice if I‚Äôm sitting right across from him on a bus

\- He‚Äôs simple minded and takes everything at face value. For example, when I got bullied by a couple people for being fat, he believed it when they said they were just saying things to try to help me lose weight. Not sure if this counts as simple minded, but he also once said something along the lines of, ‚ÄúWho cares if she was just using you for some attention? Either way you enjoyed the time you spent with her when you didn‚Äôt know.‚Äù

\- Gives unsolicited advice such as suggesting diet tips for me because he thought I wasn‚Äôt losing weight quick enough or telling our other friend to not only talk about himself and ask other people questions too.

\- Gets mad if someone ‚Äústarts a problem‚Äù. For example, our friend was getting harassed by a gay guy who sent unsolicited nudes and told our friend he would rape him. After this incident, our friend wanted to report the guy to the counselor since he was afraid of him. However the friend I‚Äôm writing about got mad and said, ‚ÄúWhy would you do that? You‚Äôre just causing problems.‚Äù I believe it‚Äôs because he didn‚Äôt want the gay guy to come confront us.

\- Has admitted he has a temper but hides it. He can be stubborn, tends to think he‚Äôs right, and is pretty judgmental. He judged a friend of mine for making out with a stranger at a festival and told me he finds another friend of mine annoying because she‚Äôs too outgoing. 

\- I don‚Äôt know how serious he was about this because he never looked depressed, but he has mentioned being depressed and contemplating suicide back when we were 14. Another time, he had his head down on a table so I thought something was wrong. I asked what happened, but he got annoyed and gave me attitude. Besides these moments, he typically seems phlegmatic and indifferent. He‚Äôs not expressive of emotions though.

\- He‚Äôs socially awkward, is too nervous to speak to any girl, ignores cashiers or people who try to offer him a deal such as when a student approached us at lunch asking if he wants to buy some candy. Once a coworker at his summer internship wanted to befriend him and asked to hang out, but he ignored her texts and wanted to get away from her because he believed she was interested in him while he wasn‚Äôt into her.

\- Dislikes being told what to do by sister and talked smack about how she‚Äôs fake nice trying to do things for people just to get favors in return. In his college essay, he wrote about how his parents are annoying for comparing him to her saying she‚Äôs more hardworking and better with people. 

\- Passive, never leads groupwork or take initiative for anything, is uninterested in keeping friendships or getting into a relationship. He never initiates a conversation via text with anybody and doesn‚Äôt ever try to initiate a hangout with anyone.",1608621503

I am curious to see if MBTI has significant impact on what people fear or we all share somewhat similar level of fear for the same things.

Some terms sound similar to each other, I want to see if those terms will have similar scores among types.

I didn't include some common fears such as heights, spiders etc. because I was focusing more on mental fears than on physical ones.

isfp,"Hi, it's me again! Thank y'all so much for helping me last time. Turns out all of you saying ""just tell him you listened to it already"" is just the push I need to just go for it! Thank you also to everyone who messaged me, I'm sorry I haven't responded to any of it (I'm too shy!) but I really appreciate it all. 

I told him that I listened to it and I really liked it. I even told him I currently have it on repeat. I also tweeted some parts of the song I like (I'm afraid to point it out directly on our conversations yet so yeah twitter haha!). I felt bad for delaying saying all of those things to him so I thought of a gesture that might help us get to know each other more. I made a playlist on Spotify including the song that he sent me and added one of my favorite songs that made me think of him (I didn't him that). I told him that he has great taste in music and encouraged him to add some more songs for me to discover. He added three songs there and I listened to them. I told him I'll add songs too ( I'm still finding great songs, I'm trying to impress the guy). I was in euphoria. It's like passing secret mini love notes, the kind where you are sort of telling each other something, but not really saying anything (i hope I'm making sense). So that's our playlist, our happy little bubble.

I really like him and up to now I still want to know the reason why he sent me that song in the first place. Knowing that I won't find direct answers from him soon, I asked around some of our mutuals. Unfortunately, one guy friend of ours told me that said sent song was one of the songs my isfp crush and his infj ex listened to a lot back when they were together. I stalked the girl on her Instagram and there's a caption on the photo (dated almost a year back) that is a line from the song. Few days after the said post is my isfp crush using the very next line of the song as a caption too. Hurts so badly. Now everything feels kinda off. It makes me paranoid, sad and stupid that there's a possibility that it's not about me in the first place. Plus, the ex feels like she's never truly been out of the picture. To this day I can spot some recent posts that somehow let her indirectly communicate her feelings to him and yes there are times when he indirectly replies.

I feel like running away. To abandon the playlist and our conversations altogether. I hate the situation that I am in, it brings up the worst version of myself. I tend to approach attraction as something light I and fun -preventing the expectation of any labels get to us. Now here am I, overthinking everything.

isfp,"I am a 32 year old ISFP, Anyone else find it difficult to tell stories? Stories about events both recent and distant past, my episodic memory is choppy for a large part, Ive observed people endlessly, and I am jealous of their level of recall, and not only tell an interesting story or event and anectodes but also layer it with jokes and quick wittedness whilst telling them! 

What grates my soul is that the majority of people demonstrate it readily. A great biographical memory, as well as inflecting with wit, it makes for a lot of personality, it is the superpower I wish I had! 

I will die jealous of the mental acuity people have in not only telling stories, but pacing themselves, adding jokes, and reflections. A good story teller, makes for a great personality. I must be autistic.

One was creating a discord server with all 16 types (my own idea and I've not seen somebody else do this before me)

Create a youtube channel with either all XNTX types or to be different all XNXP types. 

So I just have this thought what if we combine them and have a youtube channel with 16 types. This would mean a balanced perspective from all the types. Types like ESTJ ISTJ  and ESFP will achually get recognised for once as most mbti YouTube channels are just run by INXP or INXJs or at most ENXPs. 

It will be intresting to see how the 16 types work together setting up the foundations off the channel 

Different types will take on different role while setting it up. This dosnt mean IXFP cant be a leader or a Perciever can organise the channel but I think there are different roles that will suit different type better. 

All types will be on at some point especially when we are making a video about that specific type or that group off type however only some not sure how many will for videos not related for a certain type. 

We will probably have a discord invent new typing methods and build a website in the future

This is really ironic for MBTI meme standards, because I (an INFP) am trying to help my friend (an ISFP) sort his life out. Meme's aside, I require help with trying to find the best solution for his situation.

So I've known a (I'm certain on this) ISFP friend who's been mostly a deadbeat all his life. He's undergone some serious trauma and is slowly recovering (I'm proud of him for that) and I believe his primary woe is that he feels useless. He sucked at schooling, has a poor memory and seems to only be valuable in retail. He's told me he's good at learning practical things and experimenting which I'm glad he is. I've given him confidence that his IQ isn't indicative of his inherent value and him being good with praxim proves he isn't inherently useless.

He wants to improve and have some confidence in himself but he sometimes acts like he doesn't have the tools he needs to fix himself. He's open to my advice, but it seems like sometimes they fall on deaf ears unless the results are \*instant\*.

Example of his instant gratification is shadow work; I've helped him discover the root cause of his insecurity with schooling and his complex dissipated right there. NOW he's interested in learning about it. However, I feel like if I'm around him constantly, he won't actually get a chance to learn for himself.

So I told him he could start reflecting on where he is right now and if he's satisfied with that and basically undergoing some intense character scrutiny. This whole idea of reflection seems completely alien to him like he's never seen the light of day. 

I've told him to buy a notebook by next week and see if he keeps his promise, but until then, I'm pretty stumped on how I can best guide him to individuate.

For those healthy ISFPs out there, please tell me what's kept you aligned with your true self and how you've managed dealing with the complexities of life, what's given you value and where you give value. I'd really appreciate it :)

I've been into MBTI heavily for about a year now. Last year around this time I tested ENFP but I am  obviously an introvert, i literally can feel when it's drained and my vision will even start getting unclear.

I've delved into a lot of tests, cognitive functions, etc. and I do know a lot about them, but the issue is seeing them in myself. I always test intuitive but I'm wondering if that's test bias on my end.

I know INFPs always set themselves in being different (especially 4s like me) but I find myself cringing at some of the stereotypes and the things I see INFPs being into. I saw one thing about INFPs commonly being very ""SJW"" but although I do share a lot of those beliefs I am on the complete opposite end of the political spectrum. I also like gossiping and hearing about other people's days and what they did.

Most of my friends are sensors with my best friend being ESFP and my true best friend who I get along with super well being ENFP. My boyfriend is an ENFJ and my ex-boyfriend who I got along with super well was an ISTJ.

isfp,"I was wondering if any ISFPs have the same problem as me. Throughout my whole life, I've had a bad habit of getting really interested in something only to get bored once it no longer feels new to me or when it gets too tough and I don't feel like its worth it.


I don't want to feel like this anymore. I want to actually commit to the things I love, but I get easily discouraged when I don't see immediate improvement. It's also just hard for me to keep myself on a schedule. I told myself every morning I was gonna do 30 minutes of exercise but kept finding excuses to just stay in bed. My main interests I'm talking about are dance and language learning. I'm really productive when an outside force is pushing me, like if I was taking a class. But I am awful and forcing myself. I truly do love these things, I just get really discouraged easily about them for some reason. Any tips from other ISFPs?",1608043711

I want to work on getting past that. 

I'm going to reveal a truth about myself. The reason I hate my XSTJ stepdad isn't because he's a buttwipe 24/7 it's because when he is a prick he never apologizes, and one night...March 15th, 2016 he came into the house and started going off on me so hard that I felt physically threatened. I felt like he was going to hurt me. He never did, but the emotion was there.

That feeling of helplessness, and vulnerability plus his complete lack of ability to say ""I'm sorry my behavior was totally out of line"" is why I hate him.

That one incident was all it took. The rest of his behavior. The nagging, criticism, impatience, assumptions, etc I can deal with all of that. 

That one night though was all it took for me to decide exactly what kind of person he was. 

I really wish I could move past it, because I'm pretty sure he doesn't even remember it. And if he does he probably remembers more like; ""I sure taught that uppity, disrespectful Aireux a lesson.""

Oh yeah man you taught me alright. Taught me that I will do whatever it takes to not be near you. I actually lied for 2 years straight about working on Sundays just so I could get out of the house.

I think the reason is that so many people see ISFP as sort of a calm, easygoing type. And I guess I understand this to some extent, as though your just kind of going with the flow, but then it still confuses me. Extroverted sensing seems to be more in the moment to me, working with tangible details of the present. I feel xSxPs would theoretically be able to hold their ground more than xNxPs, who are more turbulent in searching for all kinds of possibilities. I feel like most of the ISFPs I‚Äôve met in my life fall into two camps - some who are really relaxed, down to Earth, friendly people who are very good at reacting to the moment, and some who are more intense creationists who are very assertive and want to build a wild identity.

isfp,"I've been getting INFJs in 16 personalities and my friend who's quite familiar with MBTI analysis even told me that she sees me as an INFJ, but then I just got told that I am more of an ISFP (Before ISFP, I got either ISFJ or ENFJ lol... I am a bit confusing, I know).

When I read about some things about ISFPs and watched the videos about it, I was able to relate some parts but not the entire of it, so here are some things about me.  


With People

* According to what others describe me, I am friendly and easy-going but that's just because I don't want to be awkward around people.
* I HATE crowded areas.
* So, that also means, I don't like people that much. I...once made a post of wanting to make a friend, but I got overwhelmed when so many people messaged me here ;-; I had to decline most of it because I lacked energy to maintain the conversation...
* I am 24 and female, AND I still don't like the idea of being in relationships at times - it has always been LDR btw (yes, I know I'm weird but I think I prefer this way tbh)
* You can already tell that I HATE clinginess.
* I can't seriously deal with those who always expect so much from me - maybe at some point, it's okay to be possessive BUT not controlling.
* Toxic traits of myself - I cut my ties off with people without telling them. I know this sucks, but I don't think I owe explanations. Most of the reasons always come from clinginess, manipulation and privacy intrusion - yes, I hate being pried.
* I get told that I am creative and imaginative - that is a stereotypical ISFP, I guess?
* I also think I am quite cynical and snarky, and many people agree that I could be a bit daunting sometimes...
* Honestly, I started give less shit about people because I don't think it's worth of wasting my energy on caring about their stupidity. 
* I can read people's mind somehow... I can just tell what they are thinking by reading their facial expressions and gestures. 

Emotions

* I had hard times of letting go of the things, but this year, I adapted the mindset of forgetting about all the past mistakes and traumas I had with people. I strive to not to dwell on them anymore.
* I am actually very inexpressive with my feelings. 
* I...don't think I get angry as much as before.
* But I get bothered when someone doesn't have a proper etiquette on table... 
* Oh yeah, I think the last time I got angry was when my aunt was convincing me to agree with way she thinks - I can understand why she thinks of the things on certain ways bc of the generation gap, but I think she was a bit manipulative.   


General thoughts

* I do care about the environmental and social issues, because I think there needs better changes in the society. I strive to contribute as much as I can, and help those who are in need. 
* I don't think it's good to make assumptions about people unless you really get to know about them in person - maybe everyone lowkey does in their mind but I don't think it's necessary to make people believe in your assumptions. 
* Gossips are understandable but don't make me to agree with you please bc idgaf. 
* I don't spend money on things I seriously don't need. Yes, I hate hoarding on goods.   


I..am sorry if you are a bit confused with the way I sorted things into categories, but I'd love to know if I am most likely to be an ISFP or not. I am pretty sure my Introverted Feeling is quite visible through my texts..",1607872580

I have taken the Keys 2 Cognition test several times, my most popular result being ISFP. With these personality tests, I've always seemed to have straddled the line between ISFP and INFP. I neglected to perform a screenshot of the results that shows the independent cognitive functions...

Ok... If I could please ask this community for something, if it is not too much to ask for... I have a questions... Please keep in mind that I may have been misguided by info I read on the internet.

-I like to think that I fall into the ""nerd"" stereotype rather easily. I am into anything about science fiction and fantasy. Is this entirely odd for an ISFP?
-I am a really quiet; I barely say a word all day- I am perfectly content with that. I know that it is a bit odd to ask an introvert, but are ISFP's normally quiet?
-More of an extensive question that encompasses a wider typic of Myer-Briggs Type Indicator understanding in general - I prefer to have myself grounded in what is tangible and concrete, as too much thought about what is abstract gives me anxiety. Is a need for tangibility in life limited to sensors, or do intutives need this too?

The ISFJ function stack made sense to me (although I seem to use my shadow functions pretty equally...), but I never understood the stereotypes of ISFJs. Like, yeah, I care for people, and I believe I‚Äôm a warm person, but that‚Äôs about it. I hate plans, I don‚Äôt care about keeping my room clean, I‚Äôm pretty fine with change and like to try new things, I don‚Äôt think traditions are important, I‚Äôm very unsocial and don‚Äôt know how to really BE there for someone, I like photography/art, I enjoy philosophical/political/theoretical discussions although I‚Äôm not much of a talker, I‚Äôve also been told that I seem aloof and unemotional (in my head a lot)... I can go on. 

I was recently typed as INFP from Sakinorva, but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm that idealistic in life. I admire creativity, I daydream a lot and think I‚Äôm pretty artsy, but I am practical/logical most of the time.

Anyways, I'm asking this question in hopes it will give me more clarity into whether or not this is a problem ISFPs tend to have, or if I'm just unhealthy in some manner or another.

Do you guys ask a lot of questions or find yourselves being very curious about deeper things such as religion, life, and philosophy?

I've done tests, researched cognitive functions, enneagrams, the four temperaments, etc., and I keep getting different results. I know for sure that I'm not ExxJ, I am fairly certain I'm a feeler(?). I feel like since I've started researching MBTI, I've always gravitated to the type I *wanted* to be and not who I really am, to the point that I have no idea who I actually am. I know MBTI is only a theory, but it feels strangely important (almost necessary?) for me to find out who I am since I've always felt odd. I don't mean this in a ""oh I'm so quirky"" way, I've often wished I could understand why I don't fit in. Not necessarily to change it, but to understand why. 

As a child I used to be more ""normal"", much more extroverted and in the moment than I am now. I still think I can be in the moment when I need to, but I tend to zone out when bored or uninterested. Never liked sports and practical subjects like math or chemistry. I always hated being told ""this is the way things are"" without any room for my own thoughts or opinions. Of course, certain interests and hobbies aren't exclusive to one type, but my interests are mostly ""intuitive"" type hobbies. I also procrastinate a lot. 

The thing is, I sometimes feel like I've got some kind of intuitive bias ingrained in me. If I'm being honest, I don't *want* to be an ISFP, and I know that's irrational and stupid since I know several intelligent, amazing ISFPs myself. So maybe it is my bias shining through, making me think that I am all these things when I'm not. That does seem a bit absurd but I keep feeling that way.

Anyway, sorry for rambling. I hope someone can help me figure it out. I'd love some practical examples on how to tell apart INFPs and ISFPs since I have a hard time recognising my own thought patterns.

I‚Äôm a substitute teacher that is teaching an online remote class, and I realized that I was spending a great deal of time on ideas that I really enjoyed, but that weren‚Äôt necessary, and ended up causing me a lot of stress. 

For example, I tried to make video lessons of everything that I was doing because I thought it would be fun to make videos and the students can review and watch them over and over again. But I ended up having to drop it mainly because it was unsustainable because of all the other garbage that I absolutely had to do. 

Now I‚Äôm constantly asking myself:

‚Äúam I required to do this?‚Äù 
‚ÄúCan I reduce this task further‚Äù
‚ÄúCan I find ways to complete this faster‚Äù
‚ÄúIs this too time consuming?‚Äù
‚ÄúIs what I have effective‚Äù

I can feel the Fi-Te struggle as I do this, because I constantly want to do things that I think I would enjoy doing but every time I ask myself those questions I have to accept that I can‚Äôt do those things and I need to focus on my requirements. 

For example, I have to make online copies of books, but I‚Äôll get caught up with getting perfectly centered images that waste time. And so I have to ask myself, ‚Äúis this ugly image I took readable ...yes... Then it‚Äôs good enough.‚Äù I feel my soul dying when I do that, but it gets the job done faster.

So being a 6, I worry a lot which really causes me to not be able to live in the moment when I'm not feeling great about myself. I'm always worrying about things going wrong. I think this also leads to a lot of my values looking more like Fe values. I am never late, always 10 minutes early or on time. I hate general rudeness. I value being safe so I'm not a huge risk taker and don't like breaking the rules unless I absolutely have to.


When it comes to stress, that means Te grip combined with disintegrating into 3. I usually overwork myself in order to keep up with all my stress. Before I learned about the enneagram, I never saw it as stress, I just saw it as me trying to work hard which I guess it still is. But its not good for me I suppose, gotta relax once in a while. Haha nope.


I mentioned the instincts as well because I think they explain a lot as well. I have a hard time connecting with people who aren't also sx first or at least not sx blind.

isfp,"hey gang \^\^

so i've got this question in my head for a while now and i'm not sure if this is an ISFP or a general people thing. 

do you guys ever feel a little uncomfortable when someone you know starts liking the same tv show or music group that you've been into for quite a while and proceeds to completely indulge in the fandom or aesthetics and later tries to educate *you* about it? 

it can be educational yes, but it could get to a point where they think you're not worthy of being a fan bc you don't seem as invested as they are.  

i'm aware that as ISFP's we treasure our identity and our unique quirks. so when someone is trying to rob you of that, does it make you feel a bit icky?  

i just don't want to feel selfish is all and don't want enjoyment/entertainment to become a competition of who watches things the most or who listens to the most songs  ;-; 

i'd like to know if other people experience this feeling or if it's just me.",1607363740

isfp,"My 3 best friends, I've met around 5 years ago, we talk a lot to each other, and we constantly have a good time together. However, I can't help but constantly think and overreact if they genuinely want to be with me or it's just me who goes to them and they have to deal with it. This has slowed down over the last few months, but it still happens, I know I'm overreacting, but I just can't help it. I don't have much self-esteem (only in the last month or so that I actually started to have more self-esteem), so that does not contribute to it.

&amp;#x200B;

Another constant overreaction I have is, for example, when I'm texting someone and then I say something at the moment. But then later I keep that thing I said in my head and I'm overreacting with it, telling myself that that was stupid, that they are mad at me now and will be some time without talking with me. Again, I know I'm overreacting a lot, but I just can't help it.

Do you ever feel like not a single person you know truly understands you? It is such a lonely feeling... Throughout my whole life, I‚Äôve never had a set of friends that I felt I belong with, could rely on and could hang out with without feeling drained. 

I‚Äôm sitting here, crying while writing this. This sort of loneliness is something I‚Äôd never wish upon anyone. Anytime I go on social media, all I see are people out and about, living their best life while I‚Äôm at home, struggling to get through the day. I‚Äôm in my mid 20s and I feel so heartbroken for myself because I spent most of my life struggling with my mental health and dealing with very toxic people. I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôve lived my life at all and now life is just passing by me. 

Don‚Äôt get me wrong... I love being alone and taking myself out on little dates... but sometimes, a company or two wouldn‚Äôt hurt... company who truly understands you and with whom you don‚Äôt need to put on a facade... 

All I want in life is to find my tribe. I don‚Äôt want those friendships where all we do is gossip or talk shit about people. I want real, genuine friendship. I want friendships where we can do random, spontaneous trips, have deep conversations by the beach at 3am, cook together, go crystal shopping together, talk about our mental health without fearing any judgement... :( I can‚Äôt even remember the last time I was hugged tightly by a good friend.

isfp,"Hi all,

I am an INTJ and just recently met an ISFP with a somewhat avoidant attachtment style. 

Her infornation from what I have gathered from our dates so far: stubborn, doesn't ask for help, quiet, reserved, smart, like to play chess, reqlly love travelling. She said that she had been in 3 relationships and all of them didn't last past 4 months because to her everyone seemed boring and everything was always the same and they didn't respect her.

During the past 2 months, we had been on a few dates and she shared a few of her favorite things like movie, book, music... I tried everything and gave her my honest opinion that I only liked the movies she reccommended and not the music or tv gameshow.

Lately, she seems somewhat even more distant than normal (read my message and didn't reply for a few hours...she had never done this before so this is not her normal behaviour). She is getting stressed out at work, get headache and not enough sleep. My thinking was that she didnt get to travel a lot this year due to covid so it finally stressed her out. She seems pretty happy and hanging out with friends every day though.

So now do I just proceed even slower and gave her some time to recover? Normally how long does an ISFP trust someone else enough to let them into their inner circle?(pretty sure its a dumb question because everyone is different but i will just throw it out to have some reference). I plan to help her to take over her work for a while so she has some freedom to travel but dont think she will accept considering that she is stubborn. I dont mind doing things to help her because as long as I can learn new skill and helping her out then it is ok.

They are well-liked in part due to coming off as ""chill"" and relaxed, in addition to being willing to go with the flow/spontaneous and comfortable discussing different subjects with people. They do spend time on their appearance, as their parents have taught them that looking presentable is important - they have makeup expertise and always know how to look good (they follow different makeup channels on social media,) and they tend to notice physical changes in other people quite quickly. They are quite focused on their appearance, as they want to be physically appealing to others and understand that beautiful people are granted more privileges. They are humble in spite of their popularity, and empathetic (though they can become moody at times.) They are known for being a bit of a trendsetter at school in regards to fashion, though this is entirely unintentional (this is partly why they are known for being ""cool"" amongst their peers.) They maintain average to slightly above average grades in school (think B's to C's,) due to simply being a bit more focused on their social life, though they are rather smart and have a varied amount of interests (their mother wishes that they would focus some more attention onto their grades, though they have promised that they will in the future, as they are young and although they live in the moment, think about the future often enough to understand that they cannot slack off in school.)

I recently went on a date with this ISFP guy, we clicked very well... we spent a whole night talking, he said the connection we had felt ‚Äútoo good to be true‚Äù and that he never opened up like this with anyone. He was very straight to the point in the beginning, letting me know he was attracted to me for a while now! I felt very confident and was very surprised that I finally met someone who I could see myself with. A few days after that, we saw each other again at college and things felt different, he didn‚Äôt approach me, he only looked at me, he saw me concerned about something but never really took the chance to ask me if I was okay or not (I was feeling anxious about a project) and I could feel he was restless but at the same time it looked like he was scared of asking or showing concern. On the first date he did admit that he doesn‚Äôt approach me more times due to the fact I‚Äôm always with another friend and I guess it‚Äôs uncomfortable for him?

Anyways, I‚Äôm feeling very frustrated because I don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs just stepping back, if after processing the whole date he doesn‚Äôt want to pursue me for some reason. He does look like he wants to spend time with me but he never initiates, he just looks at me a lot, says a word or two and tries to make time to be around me but he never really goes all the way. And to be honest, it‚Äôs always been me inviting him to go out for a coffee or to spend time together but he always sounds enthusiastic to go.

\*He starts to be mega intolerant in politics,  he starts a clash between him and one friend of mine because politics and sjw things,  our friend voted for a candidate that he does not find acceptable for offending something that sjw and him believe, so he just blocked our friend for everything, dont even try to understand why he voted or whatever.  never spoke to him again.

\*He starts recently a clash with our entj father for the same thing, he is not so assertive like my father, so he kinda got overwhelmed in the discussion, he silently starts hating my father saying he is homophobic and etc, but he dont even talk this directly to my father, my esfj(?) mother who told me his rants.

isfp,"¬∑ Spends a lot of time dolling up doing makeup and dressing nicely because she always wants to look good/sexy to feel better about herself; her self-esteem is highly tied to how she looks. If she has a pimple or gained a few pounds, it‚Äôs a blow to her self-esteem.

¬∑ Somewhat follows trends, but always wants to put a special flair to her outfits or do something slightly different because she wants to stand out.

¬∑ Always seeks to be in a relationship with a prince charming but often ends up idealizing her partners. She seeks someone who can help her with her insecurities.

¬∑ Very sensitive; she‚Äôs easily offended by small things people say, cries more easily than an average person, and some people call her bitter because she can take a long time to get over something she was upset by.

¬∑ Can be passive-aggressive; she‚Äôs not one to confront people head on, but she‚Äôll make passive-aggressive witty digs at them via social media or mumble something under her breath to let them know she‚Äôs talking about them, but then deny it. 

¬∑ Doesn‚Äôt get angry that often but can get annoyed easily and isn‚Äôt one to run away when there‚Äôs actual conflict going on. Many times when she‚Äôs genuinely mad, she‚Äôll fight fire with fire which escalates the argument.

¬∑ When stressed, she‚Äôs quite open with her emotions; she‚Äôll vent to friends and have them support her or give advice, but she can be excessive with her negativity or get defensive when she hears advice she doesn‚Äôt like. She mainly gets stressed about appearance related things and will go to extremes like not eating in order to lose the few pounds she gained. 

¬∑ Can be hot and cold or unpredictable; she‚Äôll be happy one minute then suddenly something small might happen and she‚Äôll flip her mood completely. We could also make a joke teasing her and she‚Äôll laugh at it but get offended at the exact same joke a different day.

¬∑ Switches between life of the party and introverted; she has days she‚Äôll go out to party and get wild drunk but days where all she wants to do is stay at home and sleep all day. 

¬∑ Easily jealous of other people; she has low self-esteem and compares herself to others often then feels envious when she feels they‚Äôre comparable or better than her, especially in terms of looks. Although she has low self-esteem, she wants attention to feel better about herself but gets shy when she actually receives attention. 

¬∑ Has ‚Äúdiva‚Äù tendencies of doing whatever she wants whenever she wants to, but she doesn‚Äôt realize it and feels like she should be able to feel comfortable being herself without having to change who she is for others. She gets defensive that people are trying to change or fix her.

¬∑ On a normal day, she can be chill and friendly; people who don‚Äôt know her well would describe her as shy, quiet, and nice. 

¬∑ Doesn‚Äôt cope well with responsibilities like school and work; she gets everything done but burns out easily and tends to cry over having too much to do. 

¬∑ Back in elementary, she was bullied for being really quiet with no friends. Someone defended her, so she became friends with the girl and admired her to the point of wanting to be like her. However she stopped that in high school.

¬∑ Doesn‚Äôt care for money or high status; she‚Äôs majoring in interior design because she believes in doing what you truly enjoy doing more than getting into a career just for money‚Äôs sake 

¬∑ Creative and artistic; she enjoys designing other things like outfits, makeup, is good with things like creating hairstyles and dyes. 

¬∑ Usually has strong opinions about things whether it be her stance on something, how something looks, her thoughts on a person or situation, etc.

¬∑ She‚Äôs quite generous with her money and when it comes to gifting a person, she will often gift something pretty expensive and aesthetic. She has given friends free haircuts, eyelash extension services, and more.

¬∑ Loves the finer things in life such as high-end designer bags and accessories, things like a luxurious looking vanity in her room, fur, leather, and other Hollywood type of things.",1607072591

Looking at stereotypes I'm a Ti dom,  because I'm a logical person ,  I like debating (truth &gt; winning &gt; opinions of others) even when I'm thinking I'm debating myself most of the time, I spend most of my time learning theories and even if I'm not learning them directly I'm either thinking about them or looking at memes about them,  I'm not that emotional and I'm not a [fan](https://media.4rgos.it/s/Argos/4569846_R_SET?$Main768$&amp;w=620&amp;h=620) of the physical world.

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, these points are very shallowly explained. That's because I have thought them through on my own so just assume that they are true.

Now my question, the points I described are stereotypical for Ti (more Ti-Ne than Ti-Se) however as I said before these are stereotypes and it doesn't have to mean that a type like ISFP doesn't show these behavioural patterns. So, are there any ISFPs that can relate to the points I made.",1606831213
isfp,"I'm typed an infp. ISFPs to me feel very cold and unforgiving, and intolerant to other people, not seeing the good in them (sorry). 
I've realised it's the annoying Fi-Te familiarity, with the se ni ne si axis as follows:

Se Ni vs Ne Si. ISFPs have a very sure vision of what they want in the future and get it, while being highly action oriented and in the moment. They are Ne blind which means that Infps moping and thinking about what to do, not finishing projects gives them a heart attack. Infps se blindness makes ISFPs seem way too blunt, quick to judge and short in the way they interact with people. Infps are far more detailed with dealing with emotions and are extra careful with the way they come across with it, and are careful to give second chances. ISFPs are less emotionally indulgent, and pragmatic when dealing with people and don't give a fair overview (in my humble infp opinion). Alphas and deltas have this issue interestingly with the opposite qiadras. 

Infps are more prone to be stuck in the past, highly aware of consequences, analysis paralysis. (4w5 staying in their own mind for years lmfao). ISFPs are more grounded and pragmatic dealing with emotions, while infps sit with their emotions far longer which sucks (fi si). Infps are more likely to be receptive and sensitive to others perspectives with an ne si axis (deltas and alphas). Coupled with fi-si it makes us extremely sensitive to people NOT BEING SENSITIVE. ISFPs are empathetic but don't get caught up with these things. Infps are sensitive to others but emptionally indulgent. ISFPs are more pragmatic but less forgiving. Which then annoys the hell out of us bc y'all look so much like us but you are so different.",1606807634
isfp,"I had an emotional talk with a friend earlier. I don‚Äôt wanna go into detail, but I had hurt him despite trying my best not to. When I realized how badly I had hurt him, I cried. Hard. 

He asked me if that was a ‚Äúnumber‚Äù thing (Enneagram) in regards to being so emotional about not wanting to hurt others. 

I told him that I already hate myself, and when I hurt other people, it‚Äôs like a real, physical confirmation that the hate I have for myself is justified. When I hate myself in my head, I can kind of convince myself it‚Äôs just me, but when it exists outside of my noggin... yeah.

isfp,"NGL, this is definitely big self-stroking ego time but I‚Äôm curious. 

So there have been a few times when someone was learning some kinda skill, like a dance skill or music skill etc. And I either know or they tell me that they have been practicing this skill for days, weeks or months. And then me being curious, I come in and try it out, and learn it in like one sitting.

And then I just feel bad/awkward, cause they look at me like wtf. And then I apologize and immediately stop, or give some excuse like ‚Äúoh well I spend a lot of time practicing this other thing, so I think that just carries over.‚Äù And then its worse when they go ‚Äúyeah I also practice that other thing.‚Äù And then I just wanna walk off the face of the earth. 

This recently happened with my dad, who has been practicing the accordion since the pandemic started, and I hear him everyday practicing the same set of scales. So a few days ago I decided to try it out cause why not, and within an hour I was able to play it back and forth, and I even came up with a little melody, and then I just looked at my dad who had that ‚ÄúI‚Äôm dying inside‚Äù smile. So I pretty much stopped playing the accordion since that one day. 

I‚Äôm really not trying to gloat, but if you wanna call me out on it, fair enough. Burn me at the stake if you must. I just wanna know if you guys had experiences like this. Do you sometimes not even try something out for fear that you might make someone you know feel bad?",1606564014

isfp,"Hey guys, so I'm confused as to whether I'm an ISFP or INFP as I came to a realisation that my self-perception is flawed. Some background about myself: I come from a single-parent family (since 5 years old) and my mum raised me. I am a female in my early twenties. Even as a child, I would see myself being more ""wise"" than my peers due to my mother having no one to share her feelings with, and as a result, that person would be me. I always did well in school and I guess I developed a sense of perfectionism in myself too. The first time I almost failed a test, I went to the toilet to cry.

I am pretty sure I am a Fi-Dominant, for lack of another function which I strongly relate to, but I wouldn't call myself gentle and kind of anything. More like ""self-absorbed"", like I just do what I want to do and don't regard for other people's feelings as much (it doesn't come naturally to notice their needs). Outwardly I might seem pretty unassuming and quiet, but I recently realise that I judge people a lot internally and tend to place them into boxes even before really getting to know them and this is pretty bad. So if my mind already has a bad impression of a person, perhaps thinking we don't share similar vibes and won't be good friends, I wouldn't even bother actively talking to that person. That might be the reason why I don't really have friends but yet really want to find someone who understands me. I could be slightly blunt sometimes too, especially if we are close. I think one of my values is honesty so I will always tell the truth and I don't tend to sugarcoat much once I get comfortable with a person. I saw myself as smart and logical but my coworkers saw me as warm, friendly, although blur. I have been told that I was naive and ""living in my own bubble"", so it seemed like I wasn't who I thought I was? I don't think my close friends would call me weird, but my colleagues at the workplace think I'm slightly weird? I don't get their jokes and neither do they get mine. I do realise most of my jokes are pretty punny, is some form of wordplay or association? For example, they were talking about someone going to town, and I thought of santa claus haha, because santa claus is coming to town. 

I don't enjoy getting my hands dirty but I was taught how to connect wires to the TV and stuff, so I can do it. I'm not super practical, I don't need a plan to be implemented in real life and would rather design it anyway. Yeah, I was an events director who only came up with the idea and screwed up the execution process on the day itself. I'm not sure if I was creative per se, but when I was a child, I would create dialogues with my soft toys and would create some story and be into it for hours. My mum couldn't understand why I was talking to inanimate objects and threw my toys away. I do enjoy music (I play the piano and violin, though not at a very proficient level), and I write my own fantasy stories. Sometimes the inspiration would come from some other books, and I would twist the plot and made sure that I got the ending I wanted. But, I don't daydream although I space out a lot mid-conversations and in general. I wouldn't say I'm really future-oriented either.

How I relate to Se:

\- I'm usually pretty observant to my surroundings and I don't lose important things very often. This is compared to my ISTJ mother who always can't seem to find her belongings. I'm not sure if I was always observant since young, as I only remembered that I was like that ever since I got bitten by a bee and developed some sort of phobia towards insects. I would freak out if I even saw a butterfly. Hence, I would be very sensitive to my surroundings to ensure nothing takes me by surprise. 

\- I am indulgent in TV, food and video games (since I broke up, video games has been my mode of escapism). Actually, I realise most of my life is just playing video games or something and I actually don't really go out often. Are video games an Se thing? Though, I hate those games like counter-strike and PUBG, those first-person shooting games because it scares me. 

\- That said, I'm not a fan of any physical activity and can't do sports, dancing, knitting, baking, cooking etc. It's not that I haven't tried them, it just comes off as being really clumsy, especially since I am surrounded by ISTJ/ISFJ friends who seem to excel in dancing/baking. I also hate the likes of taking a walk or hiking or exercising. I wouldn't call myself a big thrill-seeker, like I do like rollercoasters, but I will never get a motorbike or something. I am slightly awed about extreme sports when I see them on TV, like it seems cool and all, but I will never risk my life like that. 

\- I'm not really good with directions and if I am engrossed talking to somebody, I will lose focus of my surroundings and either the other person has to steer me in the right direction, or we will end up being lost. Basically any time I don't focus on my surroundings, my body goes on auto-pilot by its own.

How I relate to Ne:

\- I do see possibilities and am pretty indecisive about almost everything. If there were any big decisions to be made, I would be overwhelmed by self-doubt. Just like how I'm doubting my MBTI type. 

\- I always prefer the ideas part than the execution. I'm good at providing ideas for events but somehow they are not very practical. 

\- It isn't something like ideas pop into my mind all the time, but rather a tap that I can switch on and off.

\- I enjoy discussions about deeper meanings although I probably won't be the first one to start such conversations. 

\- I am not against concepts, theories and impractical ideas

\- I question anything. I used to ask my mother a lot of questions, and sometimes she would respond with ""It's just the way it is. How would I know?"" I'm also not religious in nature and would often question religious activities and traditions. 

I like people and do want friends in my life, but find it difficult to connect on a deep level (most of my friends are sensors). I didn't even know I wanted deep emotional connections with people until I realised that it was the factor lacking in my relationship with my ESTJ boyfriend which caused it to fail. He could never understand my feelings although I read him like an open book. Hell, even my mum says that she never understood me and my close friends tell me that I have this ""hidden"" part of me somewhere which I'm not showing. Yeah, I feel that no one understands me my whole life. Recently, I was feeling really unhappy about my close friend, as I was willing to reschedule my timetable according to hers, and expected her to at least discuss with me (I approached her many times). But, she simply sent me her final version the night before. I was really hurt. I might think my Si is stronger than Se too because I am a hoarder who keeps everything and doesn't want to throw out anything. I can feel that great inertia to get out of a routine and do something new (hence playing games at home is kinda my routine now). 

Would appreciate if anyone could give me some clarity? Thanks!",1606535606

isfp,"hey guys, i have done the test many times, and first time i got isfp - i thought that it was correct result, but later i did test on different sites and it was always infp. im kinda confused cuz im almost stereotypical isfp, can someone help me? here are some of my traits..

- im really calm in conflicts, but when someone is giving me unconstructed critism or being disrespectful to my values, i can react harshly
- i never make fun of others mistakes, im pacient if helping someone
- i love my friends so much, but tbh im not really attached to them - if they turned out to be assholes i will not be hurt that much
- i hate thinking about future, it makes me hella anxious, i prefer to focus on present
-when people are talking about my mistakes from past, im really annoyed, because i dislike thinking about past too
- i rarely care about people's advices, i always listen to them or even ask about them, but when it comes to decisions i do it by myself
- i hate being same as everyone else, unorginal
- when im dealing with some kind of issue, i tell only 1-2 close people about it
- i may appear kinda attention seeking, i hate being the center of attention, but i dislike being completely excluded from something
- im honest and direct, but sometimes im scared that i will hurt someone by that

I asked him where he thought he'd be job wise in the next few years. He goes; ""Hopefully dead""

At first I wrote it off as a joke, but then he got really serious. No smiling. No witty remarks. 

He summed up pretty much said; ""My life's a joke. My last name isn't Trump, Gates, Buffet, or Bezos. I have no real talents. I'm gonna be a wage slave until I'm damn near 70. I could run my own business but I'm not smart enough or financed enough to get it off the ground, and absolutely no one who could help me is helping me. It's not about the money either. I want to start a charity. Ideally I want to pocket just enough to live in a small house, and the rest can go to charity. Nothing is going to go right for me, so I'm planning to end it. I have been for a while.""

I think honestly his folks are part of it. His dad is loaded but super stingy, and seems to think every man should be self-made with 0 help.

So his dad helped his mom start her own business but won't help him out. His mom has no business sense either. She's good at running her business but doesn't know anything about starting one beyond; ""It takes a lot of money""

My best friend who is also an isfp has recently told me that he‚Äôs given up on art. It really surprised me because for the past 9 years, everything he‚Äôs been about has been his art. He wants to settle for a mediocre 9-5 and is content with that. It scares me. I feel like if I stay in this funk for much longer, than will become me. 

My creativity is the only thing that gets me through everyday and I‚Äôm so protective of it. I‚Äôve been trying to slowly ease my way into finding inspiration from others again. I realize I gravitate towards artists who tend to have ISFP or ENFP personality types in general.

isfp,"¬∑ Very rebellious: she has brake checked a police officer who tail gated her, chased after an armed robber with a stun gun, cut a stranger‚Äôs cord because they refused to leave after closing while charging their phone, intentionally put multiple shots of caffeine into a customer‚Äôs decaf order for being a Trump supporter, disobey parents, has homewrecked a relationship, uses her boyfriend‚Äôs credit card without permission, has used a customer‚Äôs groupon without permission, etc.

¬∑ When she homewrecked a girl‚Äôs relationship, the girl confronted her which caused my sister to hate the girl and want to get revenge on her. I believe she was envious of the girl since she spent a long time lurking on her and even created a catfish profile of the girl years later as a way to get her real Instagram deleted. 

¬∑ She went through a phase when she was 14 to 15 where she wrote a lot on Tumblr expressing her emotions, mainly about love. There were many posts where she wrote about crying in the shower, heartbreak, getting her trust broken, never being able to get over a breakup, wanting to get into an accident in order to erase all bad memories, being tired of everyone and everything, people not caring about her, wanting to find happiness, giving up, how she cares too much, etc.

¬∑ She still goes through random moments of feeling these emotions at times, but to a much lesser extent compared to when she was a teenager since she‚Äôs now in her early 20s. Nowadays, she‚Äôs more temperamental or gives no fucks.

¬∑ Has a history of losing friends and arguing with family members, especially parents. Our parents have an issue with her because she doesn‚Äôt get good grades, skipped school a lot, never meet their expectations, and don‚Äôt really listen to them.

¬∑ School was never her thing because she always got poor grades. She dropped out of college and decided to become a lash technician instead. She self-admitted to being a lazy, sloppy person.

¬∑ Often she bottles up stress and anger and the result is her being tired of everything. She says venting can‚Äôt recover a person, so she sometimes feels like packing her shit and leaving without saying a word because she just wants to get out. 

¬∑ Not sure if she has the same fear now, but when she was younger, she was afraid to love because she feared getting hurt and she has high expectations of relationships because of movies. Her fear of getting hurt extended beyond romantic relationships; she also feared getting hurt by friends and family. However even though she stated this as her fear, she has never been single for even one year and if she is single, she always has her eye on someone.

¬∑ She has a close circle of people she vents to who are there for her, but also tries to never show when she‚Äôs hurt besides when she‚Äôs alone because that‚Äôs when she can truly express her feelings. 

¬∑ At one point, her motivation was to be happy because she wasn‚Äôt happy with anything in her life and had a lot of problems going on. It appeared like she was happy, but she said it was just a mask and not the real her.

¬∑ Has an elitist attitude; she hardly speaks to anyone, won‚Äôt really smile if you greet her, believes she‚Äôs better than a lot of other people, has a tendency to look down on others such as when she entered college, she started looking down on high school students. She has also walked into a store waiting for a worker to approach her to see how she‚Äôs doing instead of just directly going up to them to ask a question. 

¬∑ Takes a while to admit she‚Äôs wrong

¬∑ Claims to hate change and feel mixed emotions rushing in on her all at once. 

¬∑ Has done things like told her boyfriend how great this girl‚Äôs butt looks, but immediately got mad at him once he looked and agreed with her. She has a history of being possessive with her partners by doing things like monitoring their phones and having access to all of their accounts.

¬∑ Can‚Äôt stand when people talk shit because she thinks they should be saying it to the person‚Äôs face directly. She can be extremely confrontational and often preaches about how a person should speak their mind and speak for themselves.

¬∑ Extremely impatient; she has a tendency to get mad while waiting for food deliveries if it takes more time than necessary. She enjoys writing reviews on Yelp, but they‚Äôre mainly complaint reviews.

¬∑ She enjoys high-end designer items like expensive purses and cars. She once also replaced a car with a new one just because her old one got a scratch.

¬∑ Her demeanor has a strong presence; she walks as if she knows exactly where she‚Äôs going, has confident body language, heavier steps, and many people find her intimidating because of her resting face.",1606019445
isfp,"I am really only familiar with about half of the MBTI types. The extroverts and sensors, mainly, I know nothing about. Why I'm recently intrigued is specifically because Exxx and xSxx types rarely seem to take an interest in me as an INTJ, and the few times that somebody has reached out to me, they've been ISTJ, INFJ, and INFP, of the ones that I know about. Recently someone of the ISFP persuasion hit me up and I wonder what the difference is between this type and...literally all the others I haven't mentioned.

isfp,"Am I the only ISFP who clashes a lot with INFJs? No matter how hard I try, most of the time INFJs and I tend to get on each other's nerves and conflicting, even when I really am at first very friendly with them and did initially appreciate them.

But I've noticed that even though most ISFPs get along pretty well with INFJs, some ISFPs and INFJs are very rejective of each other. I don't know if you see what I mean, like they don't only slightly dislike each other, they really do not value at all what the other has to offer in terms of qualities and there's some kind of real... negative tension. Like both are valuing different ways of functioning so much that they're competing with each other.

When I meet INFJs, it feels like we're in the second category. They seem to dislike me for some reason even though I genuinely like them at first and genuinely do my best to get along with them.

For example:

(You can skip that part, I know ISFPs often have a low attention span, but I need to explain these details to explain my point)

An INTP friend and I had planned to meet each other on some day. During that day, he tells me he'd met an INFJ girl that I happened to know since high school (and with whom we always had friendly interactions before) the week before during a night out. He tells me she apparently seemed very friendly to him and they did really get along. So he explains to me that he and her planned to see each other later that day in a bar, though he and I already planned to see each other before that. He tells me that I can of course still come. We go to the bar and INFJ comes with another unplanned friend too (that I also knew since high school), but she seems weirdly uncomfortable. I try to make her feel comfortable and to give a very open and accepting demeanor. But she insists on sitting at another table with her friend, before finally coming back because INTP convinced her. Then she starts being friendly to everyone but... Me. And inviting everyone to her house and, it was gonna be fun, there were gonna be drinks and stuff... Except for me. Whom she's known for 10 years and we always had friendly interactions before.Then she got up and put on a very fake smile before telling me ""-I'll see you at \*some common friend\*'s birthday"". I was very uncomfortable at that moment, my initially happy and enthusiastic mood just got struck in a pillion pieces. ""-Oh, I-... I won't be there. There will be too many people and I'd rather be careful with the Covid and all."", I said in a way calmer and more closed tone"". ""I see, well bye!"", she answered, still grinning in a way that was so fake and passive-aggressive, observable in her body language and voice tone, that I felt like being face to face with some high school mean girl bully again. I didn't understand, it came from nowhere, it was a very bitchy and snobbish thing to do to me, very unfair given the fact that I had absolutely no bad intention towards her.My INTP friend assumed she liked him and perceived me as a danger as if I was trying to seduce him. Well, actually INTP had romantic feelings towards me that weren't reciprocal and I already have a partner. But even though she was jealous, I don't think I had deserved such treatment because she jumped to conclusions about me. I found that very immature of her. I'm still bitter about that moment to this day, and even more so as new negative interactions with INFJs add to that.

That was a long anecdote, but that kinda resumes a lot of my interactions with INFJs, often (not always though, but often) finding them to be very judgemental people and them taking me for their enemy or competition for some unknown reason. So even when I initially like them, I came to develop a lot of resentment towards INFJs, or more female INFJs (go figure). I've noticed that we also tend to devalue the other's way of viewing things. I'll find them to be too stubborn in their insights and not open-minded enough to new information and therefore jump too much to conclusions (like the INFJ of my anecdote) without checking the facts enough to verify it. And I guess they find me to not be conforming enough to the group's values. I'm very nice, polite and all (so much that a lot of people often take the freedom of trying to walk over me), but I'm usually honest with my opinions and won't follow a rule mindlessly if I don't think it makes sense to me (I'm also a 6w7 on the enneagram with counter-phobic tendencies). Maybe they think I'm too chaotic and rebellious for them, I somehow have that impression.

Have any of you ISFPs encountered the same difficulties with INFJs? And if there are INFJs reading this, have you encountered that kind of negative and ""hostile"" interactions with ISFPs as well? If so, what is your perception of the situation with them?

Thanks very much for reading that post and for any potential insight!",1605904553
isfp,"Hello,

I was just wondering whether I am ISFP or not, because literally  *e v e r y*  video I watched introduced ISFPs as 'The Artists' and as the ones who have an inborn talent for painting.

I don't agree with this preconception of us. For example - I loved physics, math and art classes on school.

**And then I remembered - I've got one ""artistic"" success.**

&gt;When I was in kindergarten, I took a part in a competition. Every other kid in the nursery school participated and many other nursery schools were taking a part in the competition. (So I was only 5 years old or something)  
&gt;  
&gt;The competition's topic was 'paint a picture of a bee'.

\- I can be loud and very expressive, I can laugh hard too but even though people may think that I'm not, I'm always aware of the surroundings when I do so. 

\- I tend to (or try to) be lively, carefree but I feel like suppressing my inner-self when I do so. But I would brag with anyone that I'm carefree, may be I want to be so more than I'm so.

\- I always want to try new things and meet new people, but I easily form my own judgement when meet: ""I don't want to do that, I don't like that restaurant, I don't want to talk to him.."" so I end up with nothing new and then I long for something new again. When I forced myself to just go with it, I ended up with wanting to go away or escape and regret, has to be one that I'm really comfortable.

\- Sometimes I believe that I'm an ESFP since I don't like being an introspective, quiet one who stays at home, I want to be out there, to enjoy and experience. So I act like one immediately and can be pretty convincing (or am I one?), but my internal self rise up gradually: ""I'm so shy I want to hide, that one doesn't like what I've just said, people are looking at me funny, is he mad at me, am I overdoing things, I can't say/do this it will be terrible, that one will never like me.."". So I'll try to ignore them and then I overdoing things, being too loud, too expressive, too ""attacking""..

\- Strangely, I don't have the need to express my feelings by any means, whenever I try (draw, sing, instrumental) I always think of them as boring and waste of time while I should be out there and live (this thought is very strong to me). When I can't contain my feelings anymore, I cut myself (used to), I combine music, videos or photos that I like or resonate with me, I write stories where a character(s) in there represent me or just write my feelings out, I usually do it with a burst of energy and won't do it again (since when normal, I'd consider them boring and useless) till the next rise.

\- When I'm not in a good mood, my feelings are too strong or I have strong changes of mood (easily), I tend to act pretty bold and intimidating, like I'm not afraid of anything, like I wouldn't care about anything and don't mind being loud and angry. I don't know why though but I'm not like that.

\- When my close ones face injustice or similar I get angry immediately and act fast to help them or even attacking the culprit. These times I get angry for real and if it is really strong, I don't mind fighting. Otherwise I'd still be aware of things and my inner-self may gets the better of me.

\- I can be pretty idealistic in certain matters, especially love ones, and often looking for, chasing or falling in love pretty naive, I've been through many reality-slaps so now I'm both afraid and passionate about new loves.

&amp;#x200B;

Perhaps the consequences of what I've been through makes me so foggy? I had to deal with them pretty early so I don't have a proper time growing up or get in touch with my self. It is really hard for me to choose a career, though I don't really care for one (but I need it), now I can either be a manager at a restaurant (believing I'm an ESFP) or work in the creative field (wonder if I'm creative or not). I also don't know which to introduce myself, I would be the bold, confident ESFP when I meet someone, but the inner always appear later. I feel like I can do both and be both but am I?

To experience all things or sit by the one I love silently in a quiet noon where no one and no thing could bother us.. or could I do both, am I really that special or just confused.. I need some music and some sleep now.

Enneagram wise (for any who knows) - I don't know if I'm a 7 or 4, but I believe I'm sx/sp so still the same question haha.

isfp,"First time i did an online test, it gave me INTP. I had some identification with the INTP googling the type because I'm really interested in reading philosophy and I like ""hard science"". I don't have much knowledge on physics or chemistry, or even mathematics. But I'm always consuming science communication and Sci-fi is by far my favorite fiction genre.  I think most people who are interested in philosophy are more interested in social sciences nowadays (I like it too), so I had good feelings discovering a type that involves philosophy and science. But I can't identify myself with cold/calm aspect of INTP. 

When I discovered  cognitive functions, I started to think that I am ISFD.  I am an artist and a  lot of things in ISFD make sense to me. But  philosophy is not just something I like to read, it is something i'm constantly thinking about. So I have conflicts over the fact that Ti is the ISFP devil. It is true that many difficult transformations in my life have been about Ti, but Ti isn't a rare cognitive function for me to be the devil.

isfp,"A little back story to reach the title. So, I had an account on here I had for years. I would vent about my family. My mom was a narcissistic drunk who slept around on my step father repeatedly, and treated me like a mistake my entire life. I watched her be mother of the year to my step brothers/sister, and then there was me. Growing up, she always made it a point to let me know I was the fat, unattractive girl who was never gonna be anybody. To a child growing up, that shit hurt. As an adult, that shit still hurts. 

Then, as I got older I become a pillar to her so to speak. She kept moving in with me, I was working 2 jobs to keep up 4 ppl. When I became more ""useful"" she would find other ways to hurt and control me. Threaten to take custody of my daughter, constant threats of kicking me out, all kinds of sick shit to say to keep her control. All I ever wanted was for somebody, HELL, ANYBODY, to love me. That's it. My own mother didn't love me. You know how much that shit hurts? You're such a fuck up piece of shit, who didn't even wanna be born (obviously), that your OWN mother don't even want you. That shit still fucks w me.

So, there's that. To top it off, of course I have social anxiety. Growing up, I don't recall anybody ever asking me even how my day was. Of course then, making friends was wildly uncomfortable and hard. I only would have 1 friend at a time (anything more was difficult to juggle), and just chill at home when I wasn't working. We lived states away from my family, so they only got ""mom updates"" about me. Nobody was ever really able to be close to me, and what they did/do know was ""my kid ain't shit"" bc of who SHE was.

And, here I am. Years later, adult, mid 30s, live right down the road from my family. Where they got ""my kid ain't shit"" talks about me from my mom (even as an adult), my social retardation, and the fact I disclose NOTHING about me (not only bc of who I am, but how I was growed up), I have nobody. I have no family (shock!!), I no longer have the one friend I had, and the only other person I got is my ex. 

I guess what I'm wondering, is being like this, will I ever find ANYBODY? Not even for a relationship, but like, maybe a fucking friend? Surely, I can't be so odd and mentally unstable that I can't find anybody? Right? I don't mind being alone in the least. Even though it don't sound like it. I truly love my company though. That I know is odd. But, that's a different story for a different day. I just don't want to be the only person that doesn't even have one soul crave them.",1605676122

isfp,"Having reviewed cognitive the functions, I suspect my ESFP boyfriend may in fact be ISFP boyfriend. But I may be wrong. I could use some insights, thank you in advance! 

* He‚Äôs ambiverted. Sometimes very extroverted, sometimes very introverted. He says his extraverted friends exhaust him, but he enjoys being around his introverted friends. He definitely isn‚Äôt as extroverted as some ESFPs I know 

* He doesn‚Äôt seem to fear his Ni like some ESFPs I know. He knew what he wanted to study since High School, he failed a few papers here and there but ultimately is where he wants to be atm. He takes his work seriously, one task at a time, diligently and with due care 

* He wants people to think he‚Äôs cool and mysterious. Is this Te child? Quite inactive on social media because he thinks its shallow. But he‚Äôs good with people in real life. 

* He‚Äôs very... boyish. He likes cars, gaming, football etc. He feels proud of the fact that he has watched many films and can discuss the topic extensively. 

* He tries to have a unique sense of style ... by emulating what his favourite celebrities wear. He‚Äôs quite obsessed with some of the more talented celebrities 

* He can‚Äôt stand a lot of ESFP people his age. For what reason I am unsure because he never elaborates on anything he says. When I seek an elaboration he clams up. 

* He didnt have many friends going up (I think he was a bit socially awkward)

1. INFP
2. ENFP
3. ESFP
4. Other ISFPs

I think it‚Äôs because they are strong in Introverted Feeling (Fi) and weak in Extroverted Thinking (Te)

ISFP have great Extraverted Sensing (Se) and poor Introverted Intuition (Ni)

INFPs have great Extraverted Intuition (Ne) and poor Introverted Sensing (Si)

I believe the contrast is what makes ISFPs &amp; INFPs the greatest pairs for each other (At least for me bc I have a lot of INFP friends and most of my crushes are/were INFP)

INFP and ENFP are the same in terms of intuition and sensing, the difference being one type is primarily Introverted while the other is not.

ISFPs and ESFPs are similar to each other in that way as well. 

INFPs &amp; ENFPs as well as ISFPs &amp; ESFPs don‚Äôt make great pairs because of the similarities in intuition and sensing

isfp,"Hello, I'd like to confide in and ask for advices and perspectives if you don't mind

Im ENFP-F22 has been in a long distance relationship with this ISFP-M18 Amazing, it's been 10 months! (We never planned to date before so that's why you guys saw a 4 year age differenceüòÖ)

So we love each other so much, we know that, we get along really well, we always talk and communicate about everything EVERY SINGLE DAY 10 MONTHS WITHOUT skip, if we skip it we will miss each other

Then because we love each other so much and really live in different lives and cultures, he finally decided to move and adapt to my culture and religion a few years from now, his end goal is to be with me and marry meü•∫‚ù§

But from then on I felt like I became a little bit controling (because he wanted something serious aka future marriage) so I was really really jealous when he had a few girl friends, so it made me feel insecure and think too much and unconsciously created negative thoughts like ""he does flirtatious things with his girlfriends etc."", REALLY are hard times for me because you know like MY THOUGHT WAS TOO STRONG, IT FELT REAL! ü•∫ and I kept talking about it with him, I need him to convince me that nothing happened

After going through those hard times, then we got along as usual again, because he needed to save some extra money to one day move to my country so he decided to join the Army while still in college! üò≠‚ù§‚ù§

He then went to basic training at the end of October for 2 months,

But then a day after that I found out he recently still followed his 2 exes on instaü•∫üòî it really broke my heart.. I mean after all the magical conmection we had, why does he still want to be friends with his exes again? And also the same day I found him writing something to one of his online girl friend saying ""I love you so much, you are my lifeline, I need you please forgive me"" on July 5th, idk what friendship / relationship is he had with this girl.. but it really hurts me
 
so I really need advice from yall, should I continue this relationship or decide to break up with him? I mean, if the reason he's doing these things is seeing me thinking too much and being so insecure in our relationship so decided to seek his love need from other people than talked about it to me or seek solution together then he mybe dont love me anymore??? ü•∫üòî idk what should I do honestly, I can't talk to him about this because he couldn't use the phone during his time in the army till December ,, I just want to know the ISFPs perspective on why he did that? I want to know the reason in your opinion and want to know what kind of action should I take on him or what should I do now?

isfp," **If, I'm sorry if this article ruined your mood. It was my research result.**

I‚Äôm ready to respect them even if they disagree.Google‚Äôs personality page says, ‚ÄúESFJ‚Äôs natural partners are ISFP and INFP.‚Äù That‚Äôs actually wrong. In the theory of Socionics, ISFP and ESFJ are the contrary relationship.

1. There is no function (function corresponding to strength) within the four categories of psychological function, so it cannot be supplemented.

2. In socionics, complementary relationships are called good relationships, and relationships with completely different personalities, that is, relationships that do not match psychological functions, are called bad relationships. And it can be explained logically that they cannot complement each other. First, the psychological functional pecking order classification is from primary function to quadratic function.

Each other‚Äôs deficient functions and strengths should be the same. And that means it has the same psychological function. Otherwise you can‚Äôt make up for it.

You can‚Äôt make up for it if you‚Äôre out of the category. This is because functions outside the category are from 5th to 8th functions and cannot be supplemented because they are functions that do not have strong functions. Each other‚Äôs deficient function and each other‚Äôs strength function should be the same. And that means it has the same psychological function. Otherwise you can‚Äôt make up for it.

Psychological function of ESFJ (harmonious)

Primary function (dominant function, highest ability): extroverted emotion (Fe)

Secondary function (a function supporting primary function): Introvert sense (Si)

3rd function (a little bit less, but soon more usable when developed): extrovert intuition (Ne)

Quadratic function (too low function=too low critical weakness): Introverted thinking (Ti)

Psychological Function of ISFP (Artistic)

Primary function (dominant function, highest ability): Introverted emotion (Fi)

Secondary Function (a function supporting primary function): Extrovert sense (Se)

3rd function (a little bit less, but soon more usable when developed): Introvert intuition (Ni)

Quadratic function (too low function=too low critical weakness): extroverted thinking (Te)

3. In the theory of Socionics, ESFJ and ISFP are contrary relationships. In other words, they belong to a bad relationship.

4. Personality is different because the functions are different. This difference can cause many conflicts.

The two types are the exact opposite of the psychological function of personality. Psychological function is the function of the mental class representing personality, and therefore the personalities of the two are the opposite.

Therefore, it is no exaggeration to say that the opposite relationship is true in socionics theory. Their four functions are all the opposite, so their minds and values are different. This difference is likely to cause many conflicts. And there is nothing in common because psychological functions are all contradictory. Also, their psychological functions can misunderstand and distort each other‚Äôs thoughts because of different languages.

**What to keep in mind**

Just because you are close to each other is not a good relationship, and looking like a compatible relationship is not a good relationship.The best relationship is consensus and complementary.

It is not a good relationship if they are close but cannot complement each other. It‚Äôs not a helpful relationship.This is what they say, but there is always a close relationship with each other even when they fight a lot.",1605410551
isfp,"It seems as if so many of the posts on this subreddit gravitate around the difference between INFPs and ISFPs, so perhaps I was fated to right this at the moment. For years I have wandered through the world of MBTI in search of my type. It took so long to try to understand myself-even now I can only see glimmers, and am still very unsure-but I am slowly beginning to believe that I am an ISFP rather than an INFP.

I find myself in parallels of both of the types. I love to soak in the world of my mind and all of its waters. I find mystery and the unknown breathtaking and am very drawn to stories and concepts. In my heart I am not a person of this world but one of the galaxies. I am tragically horrible with my hands and would much rather write a fiery story about a tale from another universe. But, in the end, I am very connected to my senses. I find tastes glorious to immerse in, I love the feeling of relishing in the glittering majesty of the sun, I love getting lost in the scarlet fires of leaves. Senses are gorgeous to me and I treasure them very much. And I think that living in the moment is an important and powerful thing.

While I still struggle to feel truly at home in either identity, I am finally beginning to expand my perception of myself. Truthfully, I don't feel like I completely belong here, but at the same time I relate to what it means at heart to be an ISFP: a wishful seeker wandering through the world, thirsting for adventure and longing to relish in all that it holds, simple and complex at once, a fragile heart in a stormy sea of emotions. I am not sure if I will ever fully feel settled in my identity, but the truth that I am probably not an INFP has finally begun to unfurl in my life.

Long story short, we have been texting consistently everyday for four months. It started off with lots of compliments, and some friendly flirting. But eventually he started to become less engaged in our conversations. We didn‚Äôt meet each other until mid-September because he was in Dallas for his clinical rotation, but now he‚Äôs in Austin. There were a few times where I would suggest going somewhere, but he didn‚Äôt or wouldn‚Äôt want to go. So I pretty much gave up lol. Then he decided to reach out and asked me to hang out with him so we finally did and it was great! I could be wrong but I felt that tension going on between us, like we‚Äôre just not friends, there‚Äôs a mutual attraction. So after that he started becoming more engaged again and then once again goes cold on me!! I eventually told him that I don‚Äôt know how to read him and that I know he wants his space but I basically told him that he doesn‚Äôt have to talk or respond to me because he feels obligated to because I don‚Äôt want him to feel uncomfortable and he said that was very kind of me and that he appreciated that.

isfp,"While I know my son is a unique, wonderful person with his own unique challenges in life, I want to look into his probable MBTI type in my search of solutions, even if it only rules out personality type as having anything to do with it.  


I love my son dearly, but since a young age he has struggled to understand truth vs lying, or has a tentative grasp of reality, or something.  When he was barely speaking, he believed his sister knocked something off of the table when she was clear across the room.  I believe it was based on strong feelings - as if he had a tendency to believe his own feelings more than what he actually saw.  I often verbally reason through things to myself, like ""maybe this happened because of such and such"" in a very logical way, and he mimics this, but it's all nonsense - like maybe a dinosaur snuck in and stole something, when he knows perfectly well what really happened and doesn't want to say, or he's just not thinking about what really happened as having any importance.  When he lies (often) he does not feel guilty, no aversion of eyes, no desire to confess the truth later - I think he barely knows he is lying, doesn't see anything wrong with it, or in his mind truth has little to do with the purpose of conversation.  He tries really hard to figure out what we want to hear when we're not happy with what he said, but doesn't connect it with telling the truth even when we talk about it, merely searching harder to satisfy the listener.  He lies very intentionally to get out of trouble with no remorse and attempts to cover up evidence, but that's the least of it.  When asked by someone if he was allowed to watch something, he acts as if they're asking his opinion, not a question about reality, and said ""no"" for essentially no reason.  He is extremely intelligent and extremely artistic.  He asks very insightful questions about science that show a good grasp of how things work.  I think this ""truth"" problem is mostly a communication problem - like why would anyone want to communicate facts?    


As an INTP, I have a tendency to use abstract logic and examples.   I'm certain that there's a better way to help him understand what lying is or how to tell the truth rather than just how he feels or what he wants us to think.  I'm looking for a way that is more natural to his personality type that would utilize his strengths.  I've already made use of his strong Se - I'll point to sensory evidence when trying to explain something instead of relying on logic or just saying ""you should believe me"".  (At one point, he had to examine an empty cookie container in order to believe me :'D)  But that doesn't seem to help at all with this lying.  I'm also hesitant to point out evidence that he'll just learn to cover up or hide better.    


Please, if anyone has any experience with this, tell me what's really going on in his mind, and the healthiest way to handle it!  If you were like this or close to someone who was, did it change over time?  If so, how?",1605220120

isfp,"My dad is an ISFP who has always hated politics and ignored all of it, but lately he keeps bringing up politics with my mom (ENFJ) and his source seems to 100% be random things he picks up from his Facebook feed. He gets mad because she .. isn't quite as tactful as she could be with this stuff, I'm sure she's coming across like she's just telling him what's true and what isn't, which won't work. I've sent him long explanations saying I understand (with elaboration, lol) and linking unbiased neutral articles from very established news sources, to show out how many things he isn't seeing (and provide an example for what an unbiased article of facts should sound like). But I don't think he's read a single thing I've sent--not my messages, not the sources. He hates this stuff. He isn't following politics on purpose in the first place, but he feels very sure of what he's seen all the same, and is getting insulted and upset when we don't see what he's talking about.

&amp;#x200B;

Trying to keep this politically neutral, but obviously it's an issue for anyone if you find out someone in your family is just accepting whatever they see on their Facebook feed, which they otherwise have skewed towards jokes and cute animals for the most part, most of it coming from strangers. He feels that he's ""seen"" proof of things because there were photoshopped or misleading pictures/videos/etc, and when my mom brings up specific current events, he just says ""I don't know anything about that"" but doesn't look into it or noticeably have an issue with the fact that he's not hearing about other important things. I thought for sure it would settle things when he shared a ""funny meme"" that insulted basically all of his family and friends, aside from my mom's super partisan brother who also doesn't follow current events closely. But it didn't.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this just hopeless? Do we leave him at the mercy of Random Joke Page politics?? Because he's starting to seem moody on a regular basis from it and is concerned about horrible things happening that really aren't likely at all. I'm an INFJ, for context, but I've had a lot of close Te dom or aux friends so I'm used to sort of translating Ti+Se into something Te can kind of respect/work with sometimes (huge win compared to where we started, lol). But inferior Te is .. not territory I'm used to for this. I'd hoped that my tactfully neutral wall-o-texts would encourage him to just stop following/believing it (because it's easier to drop it than deal with all that, lol), but it seems to be a deep enough emotional concern for him that he brings it up routinely now, and my mom just unintentionally makes him mad every time because she can't grasp how he's utterly new to this stuff. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been answering these tests (keys2cognition, sakinorva etc) a lot more honestly lately. I've also been reading up a lot on each function. The two types that are sticking around lately are ISFP and INTJ.    
Upon reading each description I found that the ISFP description called to me a bit more, but the INTJ function stack fit me a bit better. However, I don't feel like an INTJ at all (the descriptions that I see online just don't fit me mostly). Also, from a numbers standpoint, I doubt that I'm an INTJ because they're supposed to be rare.

Having to get everything exactly right, like cutting out the clips at a very specific spot, repetitively refining my work, that's where the pain strikes.

isfp," Heya, I've never really done a type me post before, so sorry if it's a bit awkward. For a while now I've been debating whether or not my Ne has been as strong as I thought it was and have been questioning my type for a good while now. Any bit of insight would be appreciated. For this I'm going to copy and paste a post I made in another subreddit, but I'll be adding a bit more extra details at the end of it. 

**Describe yourself in as much elaborate detail as possible (that still renders you anonymous, or to a level of acceptable comfort)**

For a good majority of my life I've loved art/drawing. I grew up watching animation from the 60's which helped instill a love of animation into me at a young age. I actually preferred doing art than playing on the playground, I preferred walking around the playground alone with my thoughts than to run around. I was never properly diagnosed, but I take medication for anxiety. It effected me for a good whole year that left me in a state where I could barely function. I'm generally really passive, the few times I've gotten angry around people (besides family) everyone would be bewildered. I used to be really creative growing up, I made countless comics and characters. High school has left me feeling extremely drained and empty though, I haven't had the confidence/drive to make something as much as I used to.

**Why are you interested in knowing your type?**

I want to know myself better. When I first took a mbti test I got infp, but the description didn't feel right. I was in a really unhealthy state and didn't view myself in a positive way at all. The description felt like a lie, it made it sound like I was supposed to be pure/good when I viewed myself in the complete opposite. I couldn't see myself in a positive light so I was desperate to find something else. I spent months researching mbti, I eventually learned about the functions and started to form a hobby around mbti. It became something I loved talking and theorizing about. Ever since the test, I realized I didn't know myself as much as I thought I did. I want to get to know my identity better and finally find comfort in knowing who I am

**Do you go to work and/or you in school? If so, what field/occupation/subjects?**

I'm a senior in High school, I take AP art, graphic design, psychology, and general subjects I need to graduate. A lot of the classes I've taken in the past have had something to do with film making/art, (av/band). A close second favorite for those classes would have to be english. I took ap/honors english and had a lot more fun than I expected. I was really nervous that I wouldn't be smart enough to keep up, but the worry would ease away the moment I got to write about something I cared about intensely. I still had doubt that my writing was any good, but it was a lot of fun to go over subjects that were really interesting.

**Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?**

My family was never really religious, but my grandmother was. I was really close to her and would spend a lot of time with her growing up, so I'd always hear some form of christian stories. I didn't have a hard time believing in them, but the thought of god made me feel uneasy when I got older. That was when the self hatred was starting to creep up. There were times where I'd try to find hope from god when I was feeling extremely low. I'd plea for him to help make things better, but a lot of time it never worked. I wanted to believe in something like god so badly but it became harder and harder when more and more pain would come. It made me uncertain if god really did exist. For a good while it felt like if god did exist, then he loved everyone except me. I don't rely on god as much as I used to anymore, I hardly even think about Christianity anymore. I'm still unsure on how I feel about the concept of god for a multitude of reasons

**Do you need logical consistency in your life?**

I wouldn't really say so, but I do welcome it. I want to understand the world and forces around me, I know growing up I desperately wanted there to be something I could count on that I knew was real. I'd put faith in so many different things, only to be disappointed when they'd fail me

**How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about?**

I made a lot of comics growing up. Everyday in 2nd grade I'd grab a piece of construction paper and would doodle comics about whatever was in my head. One day I grabbed notebook paper, and I managed to write more and more than usual. I grabbed a binder for the comic, which turned into a 200 page comic. I made a sequel to it and started another, but when middle school began I started to lose motivation. I started a lot of ideas but never finished them. I want to get back into making comics, but it's become harder to find that drive I used to have. I've tried planning things out in order for it not to come out badly like the comics I made before but I always end up getting anxious when realizing the idea was never that good in the first place. The first comic I made was full of references to other movies and was filled with a lot of bad cliches. But when looking at other comics/stories I've had, a lot of them have themes of escaping into another world.

**If money was not an issue, what career/job would you have?**

I'd probably be an artist or animator. It's still something I want to do, but lately I've been doubting my own abilities. Art is really the only thing I know best, but I'm not sure if I'd be good enough to get a job.

**Are you a free spirit or do you play by the rules? If so, why?**

I'd say I mostly play by the rules. It really depends on the situation. A lot of the time I'm too nervous to get in trouble, but there are also times where I've forced myself to act because I knew something bad would happen if I didn't/

**If I asked you to take a shot with a football how would that make you feel? Would you be able to do it well? Would you enjoy it?**

I've never been athletic, so I really wouldn't. Every time I get near a ball it's always because I'm about to be hit with it or avoid it

**If I asked you to write me an essay, would you enjoy it? What would it be about? How would it make you feel?**

I'd get pretty nervous. Unless there was a prompt given, I wouldn't know what to write about. I'd overthink what would/wouldn't be a good idea to write about, go through ideas that could/couldn't work, or even get so nervous that my mind goes blank and I can't think of anything at all. I've done timed writings before, and it was always nerve wrecking. I'm only really able to enjoy writing essays when I have extended time to work. When put under a limit, I pump out whatever I can in hopes of writing *anything*.

**Is it okay to crack a few eggs? If it makes an omelette? Do the ends justify the means?**

Not always, no. It depends on every situation, but there shouldn't be a large portion of people hurt to achieve something

**Do you put things back in their proper place?**

Not usually. I tend to put things where I can easily reach them when I need it. I lose stuff a lot that way. I do make sure to put things in a place where it won't get easily broken.

**How do you behave around strangers, acquaintances and friends?**

I've always been awkward around strangers. If it's around a large group of people I don't know, I get really quiet. But if it were someone that my friends had supposedly just met the other day, I'd be more open to talk. I like conversations that have really goofy/dumb humor, I can either be really talkative one day or really quiet the next. With people I don't know that well, I can sometimes come off as annoyed when in reality I'm just really tired.

**Do you have exquisite tastes that you would expend effort or money for?**

Not really, no. There are few instances where I will see something I desperately want that ends up being a lot of money, but I generally don't go after expensive things.

**How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?**

It really depends on what it is/who's asking. If it's a stranger I get really awkward and try to give it as fast as I can. If it's with a friend, I try to help in whatever way I can. If it's something I used to have trouble with then I help to try to be the advice that I had wish I'd known earlier. With family, I get annoyed more easily. I don't get along with them that much. Whenever I try to help them it either goes fine or hair pulling frustrating. I get more reactive and impulsive whenever it comes to family. Over time I've had to become more and more willing to fight back whenever someone that's a part of my family threatens to hurt someone/thing I care about

**How long do you take to make an important decision? How would you go about it? And do you change your mind once you've made it?**

Sometimes it'll take me a long time to make a decision, others it'll take less time. I try to think of what would happen if I chose one way over another. I'm never that confident when making a decision. Sometimes I'll regret the decision I made and realize a better course of action to take

**If I asked you to design a plan of action, would it be easier to work alone or in a group? Do you ask for others opinion? or stick to your own guns?**

I probably work better alone, but I wouldn't mind working with others. A lot of the time I look around to see what others are doing whenever I'm confused on instructions

**A weekend best spent looks like ...?**

Probably doing things I really enjoy. What I really enjoy doing is art and other creative mediums. I get really excited whenever I find a niche series/form of media that I never knew existed before

**My biggest fears are ...**

Probably being lied to/becoming insignificant. I've had a lot of things kept secret from me, a lot of was what was going on around me/about myself. I'm afraid of being lied to and being kept in the dark, I'd honestly would rather be told the truth than be lied to, even if it hurts

**How much do you express yourself and what mediums do you do that through? Art? Writing? Talking?**

When I was younger I'd make mini comics or write to vent. I'd always be sure to hide it in my room where no one could ever find it. I didn't have a lot of privacy growing up and I'd often get yelled at whenever my mom found hidden writing where I'd vent to myself. I gradually vented more to friends over time, which is now the main way i let out my anger. There have been times where it's gotten so intense that I'd end up physically letting it out. Everytime those moments would come up, I'd try to lock myself in my room in order not to hurt my brother. The moments I regret the most was when I physically hurt him in the heat of the moment. I try not to have those moments come up, but when they do, I separate myself from my family and end up hurting myself instead

**Generally where do you lean politically? Is it every man for himself? Should people be pragmatic? Does the government need to step in and help people?**

I don't really know that much about politics, I don't really have that much of an informed opinion. If I *had* to choose, I guess I'd be left. I generally want people to have equal rights and can't stand a lot close mindedness

**Does it matter if something is factually correct for you to believe in it?**

It doesn't have to be, but I really want what i believe in to be real. I desperately want things to believe in. It's become harder to believe in things after being disappointed for so long, but I still want something that feels real

**Are emotions/feelings an important aspect of your life? If so, then why?**

Anxiety affects me almost daily, so I'd say yes. I get emotional over a lot of things, which my family mocks me for a lot.

**How attached are you to reality?**

I find reality to be quite depressing. The thought that all that happens is nothing more than what happens in front of us leaves me feeling empty.

**How thick skinned are you? Are you sensitive to criticism?**

I've tried to become more thick skinned to criticism. I want to become better at art, so I've been forcing myself to have my work critiqued for the past couple of years. There are times where it hurts though

Lately I've been questioning if my ne even exists at all. I feel like my ne was a lot more present growing up, but has faded away over time the more and more I had to deal with reality. For a while now I've felt been in a constant state of emotional exhaustion. Working all day and dealing with school will leave me emotionally drained and empty. My brain will end up feeling like mush while I can barely think. This has made me question whether or not if I use ne at all. 

Something I forgot to mention in the original post was that I have ADD. Which, makes it hard to concentrate on things for me. Growing up I liked graphic novels and comics a lot more than plain text books. I wanted to read more plain text books, but the amount of words always left me overwhelmed. It'd always take a long time for me to concentrate on reading and it would often take a long time for me to finish a book that would take my classmates less time to read. I didn't really write a lot for myself growing up. I've tried diaries/journaling, but I'd always end up forgetting about it. I'd occasionally go back to write in it for fun, but the few times I brought it up my mom would want to read it. These felt so personal, but I was terrified of what would happen if I said no. Having her read it like it was me writing another story hurt a lot, which is probably another reason why I didn't write a lot.

On the other hand I am pretty disciplined and organised, hate spending time inefficiently, like achievement. Cant have a hobby cause I hate doing thing unprofessionally. I either do a thing as good and efficiently as my strength allows me or I dont.  


I hate expressing emotions, but like to talk about them. Like I often cry from music but I cant do thin in front of people. Sometimes when I'm stressed I have this ugly emotional shitstorm outbreaks. And I'm mostly stressed when I feel myself tired and inefficient.   


Though I look like an INTJ-ish introvert, and hate parties and all this typical introvert stuff, there is not much of things I keep to myself. If have an idea or feeling I like to discuss it or listen to others people opinion on it. I kinda love conflicts and idea clashing too.

- live and let live - personality 

seeking safety and dont mind having a routine

-daydreaming, no problem imagining or thinking or understanding abstract thoughts

-focused a lot in the present, do think about the future but have problems planning the future. Unsure if it is because I might be Se Ni or bc Im anxious(??)+ I am idealistic and full of ideas but pin pointing down what goals I have and dreams I want to pursue is hard for me. 

bc of that changing bad habits is hard for me, I have to keep reminding myself why I want to change.  

also bc I am very idealistic my high values can bring me to do the outermost (values give me energy?/ keep me going) I am currently a social worker and while its tiring, its very satifying and I am able to do it bc of my values. 

-Very passionate abd engaged, a topic of my interest make me forget everything around me and put me in a somewhat asketic mode(?) 
-VERY individualistic 
-can become quite detached from reality 


when I have a thought progress its usually all over the place but I feel like I can bring certain bits together pretty well and can present them in a structured way.

I cant spend much time thinking about the sufferings of this world or I will just keep dying inside like I cant handle it. 
- I cant handle watch animals die or horror movies (such a vanilla lol Im sorry)

- much INTUITION

-I love music for both the lyrics and the sounds but I feel like the lyrics touch me on a deeper level. - Ive also been writing before as well as dancing. 

passionate problem solver (well, other people's problems at least) 
I need harmony in my life, its like my bread and butter, but I can get explosive and have some temper if I am feeling personally attacked. 

-I used to be super naive as a kid and still believe everyones good at their core but understand that they can be mislead 

-I reevaluate my values through comparison 

I do have a lot of hobbies (listening music, writing, dancing, nailart, reading, health care and sports) but I dont pursue them in a professional way?

I cant take criticism well (And its not easy for me to admit it I guess, otherwise this would be mentioned much earlier!) even if I know its constructive criticism its hard for me to accept it and its hard for me to open up to someone that judges me often.

isfp,"So I'm back. I made a post the other day about me being INFP or ISFP because I can never settle on one type can I. Anyways, the results were somewhat inconclusive but with most people saying ISFP. This is just a add on to that really. I'm with an ENTP guy and have been close with him for such a long time. When I confided in him about this confusion, he told me that if I was an ISFP, there's no way he would be with me. Although, I don't know how much I trust his judgement, he's said other weird things like I'm just an INFP with Ni instead of Ne (yeah thats not how that works). I've already mentioned I feel close to both Si and Ni but not Se or Ne. I'll give a little paragraph about our dynamic.


We both became friends originally because of our love for anime and similar interests in TV shows and movies, well kind of. He forced me into some of his things lol. Today, we sort of clash on interests. He loves things like star wars and strategy games which I absolutely can't stand. I love kpop and Asian dramas, which he can't stand. We really bond by finding those similar interests, usually in TV shows. At best, he tolerates my interests xD sometimes, I'll want to show him dances I've been practicing but he feels like its awkward I guess? Which I can understand. Some other stuff we like to do together, and that I usually like to initiate, are cute dates. I love going out to eat, walking, exploring places. One of our first dates was at an aquarium and my heart was so happy while he was kinda just watching from afar. Something I really love about him is his creativity. For example, I will be telling him about my work day (I work at a daycare for context), and I'll tell him about the kids and such. He comes up with so many creative things he would say to them that I would never think of. We will have creative brainstorming talks sometimes but I always tire out pretty easily. Those are just a few things.


So my question is, how do actual ISFPs get along with ENTPs? They are very opposite types in my eyes so I'm curious.

isfp,"Hi there! ENFJ f here. Three months ago by ISFP m partner broke up with me after seven years being on and off (we broke up for the third and final time!)

We have not been in contact for about three months. I have not had a single interaction from him (I‚Äôm the one that usually caves through social media; last interaction from me was 1 (?) month ago because I still admire the art he creates!)

I know I‚Äôm well on the road to recovery and I hope he is too. I realised although he has removed pictures from his Instagram feed of me, he hasn‚Äôt removed tagged pictures with me in it. He also still has a large chunk of my things over the years (largely I think because I‚Äôve explained to him I am highly sentimental and I don‚Äôt want any representations of our relationship).

I know I was still hung up on him when I had tagged pictures with him on my socials and when I held onto things from our relationship. It makes me wonder if he is at the same stage or operates entirely differently.

I‚Äôm beginning to wonder if there is a tactful way of getting my things back, and if there is still a chance he hasn‚Äôt moved on as far as I have... perhaps, it‚Äôs best to just wait until he initiates contacts again if ever. I‚Äôm cool with that except I kind of miss my skateboard ^^‚Äô

&amp;#x200B;

Holland Codes are sort of like MBTI but more geared toward finding a job you like. The tests give you a two or three letter code (RIA, ISC, CAI) which you can then use on \[a site like this\]([https://www.onetonline.org/explore/interests/Artistic/](https://www.onetonline.org/explore/interests/Artistic/)) to see which jobs are a good fit for you. Just use the three dropdowns at the top to select your letter score.

&amp;#x200B;

If you don't know your Holland Code, you can try one of these tests:

1. \[123 Test\]([https://www.123test.com/career-test/](https://www.123test.com/career-test/)) - This one is short and has pictures.
2. \[Truity\]([https://www.truity.com/test/holland-code-career-test](https://www.truity.com/test/holland-code-career-test))
3. \[Open Psychometrics\]([https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/RIASEC/](https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/RIASEC/))

isfp,"Hi, I am an ENTP young adult and my 5x dad no longer lives with his wife and... relies on me for litterally everything. From giving him specific direction to physicians, to taking appointments, to cleaning up his clothes and making sure he is clean.

I know he is depressed, he feels like a loser, and so do I but not for the same reasons as him.

He believe he is a loser because he didnt manage to get any achievement in his life. Every business he started has failed despite him being a commercial talent. He feels like shit because he is receiving help from everyone in the family rather than him helping them.

I am judging him as a loser because he lacks autonomy, because he doesnt try to be autonomous, doesnt value himself and doesnt try again, because he can barely talk.

To be honest, I am seriously pissed off. He has so much experience to share, so many skills (especially as a commercial) and is an incredibly kind human being (everyone in the family loves him). He doesnt realise his value, the opportunities in front of him.

Disclaimer : I ve never been fond of ISFPs because of you guys's unability to explain your thoughts and clarify your plans. (you typically have them, but even you arent understanding your plans clearly).

Recently, I've been trying to type a friend who I suspect may be an ISFP and who's going trough a rough patch in life, and therefore might have fallen into the grip of her lower functions. She's a wonderful person with many beautiful qualities, but today, I'd like to know a bit more about this troubled side, so I can help her overcome it.

I'd love to know if you can relate to some of these behaviors:


- She loved to say that she was tough, that nothing could get through her and that she had no feelings. 

- Isolating herself to the point of being extremely reclusive. Sometimes, she'd go weeks without going to school or contact me (her best friend) in any form. When I asked her about it, she would just kind of brush it off as if it wasn't a big deal.

- A cynical attitude towards our peers. She'd often say that everyone in our class was toxic.

- Getting angry at someone (sometimes, that would be me) and not saying what was that really upset her, which kind of made everyone feel awkward. 

- Having a controlling attitude towards people, sometimes making a person her personal pet. (this one might be a false observation of mine, as she never did this to me, only to her boyfriend) 

Again, she's one of the smartest people I know and has a beautiful soul. I'm just interested in understanding her behavior and possibly helping her.

isfp,"I am here today to get some insight on some differences between these two types. I can half relate to both of them but have been typing myself as an INFP for the longest time. However, I don't relate to a whole ton of things said about the type. Either type actually. The only thing I know for sure is I'm Fi dominant which is why one of these types is really my only choice. Its really just figuring out Ne-Si or Se-Ni, both of which I can relate to as well. So imma just spit out a few reasons why I can relate to both and see what you actual ISFPs think. If any of these traits overlap with the types or can be considered for either then I'm sorry. I'm sorting them as best as possible. I'll appreciate the feedback. I can add more if I think of anything else I guess. Thanks for reading.


INFP: Ne-Si


- In middle school and high school, I really developed a love for fictional stories. I was into MLP, Doctor Who, and all sorts of anime. I didn't really like to spend time in the real world and always dreamed of just leaving it. Although, more recently I care a lot about the real world and understand my responsibilities.


- I love the feeling of nostalgia. I have a box where I collect small, seemingly meaningless items from the memories I've had. Like the dumbest things, I've got a singular birthday candle in there from a random restaurant I went to when I turned 16 or something. I've got my first happy meal items (yeah I got my first happy meal when I was like 15, don't judge me).


- I can sort of catastrophize the future thinking all sorts of things could go wrong. Worrying about the future all the time and worrying about my mistakes.


- I can get quite bored when people are talking too much about basic things. I zone out when I'm really bored in a conversation and just tend to withdraw. On the other hand, I can also get really bored when people are talking about theoretical things I don't understand so I guess I'm just a really picky conversationalist.


- This could go for either Si or Ni, but I am a decent planner. I like to know things ahead of time and don't like sudden changes that are unexpected. Or when people show up late. I just really like to be prepared for everything for the most part.


ISFP: Se-Ni


- Something I've loved for years is music. They don't necessarily need to have a deep meaning to them, but I really care how music sounds. I like particularly kpop and rock. I love loud drums and when I listen to music, I'll try to create choreography in my head or think about choreography that already exists within the song


- I'm not really into going on about many possibilities. I get really frustrated when people start talking about too many theories because in my mind, what happens happens. Theres no point in trying to make things up that may or may not happen.


- I love just doing things sometimes. Yeah its nice to sit around and just talk, I don't mind that much either. But I love going out on dates and doing things with my bf. It could be going out to eat, going to the park, just exploring things is a pretty good time. Although I can only do a little bit at a time because stuff can be overwhelming sometimes.


- I mentioned before, things don't need to be deep for me to enjoy them. I really like some very surface level shows sometimes. Asian dramas are a big one for me because I just like to see some cute, inno romantic stuff.


- I'm pretty action oriented and like when people show their care rather than just say they care. I'm not sure if this is really an Se thing or if its just normal. I hate when people are all talk no action. My love language is acts of service so thats the stuff I appreciate the most.


- A lot of plans I have for myself focus in reality. For example, I would really like to help fix the American education system someday. I would love to advocate for spreading awareness of racism.

But also some of the listed traits are almost opposite of me - the articles say that isfps are not open about their feelings, hard to get known etc, and I am extremely honest, and if I like someone, I can tell them everything about myself the first day I meet them.

Often, I find the I don‚Äôt allow myself to say something unless what I am about to say matches what I am doing. 

I think this relates to ISFPs because of our tendency to overvalue being genuine, and I would absolutely hate that someone would find me disingenuous in this specific way. 

On top of this, I am also action oriented(I assume most of us are lol), so to be criticized for a lack of action would drive me insane.

isfp,"At the end of May, I (26M) matched with my girlfriend (25F) on a dating app. We talked virtually, starting going on dates, and we‚Äôve been a couple for almost two months. I‚Äôm an ENFJ, she is an ISFP.

I think she is absolutely amazing. She‚Äôs smart, funny, sweet, truly beautiful inside and out. We have the same interests, senses of humor, and support each other‚Äôs professional and personal goals. I am so happy with her.

The thing I‚Äôd like to ask advice on is that I (very much in line with ENFJs) am very open about my feelings, and verbal displays of affection are really big for me, but not very much for her. Though she displays a lot of physical affection, terms of endearment, etc. (which I love), she is very reticent when it comes to communicating her feelings (something I‚Äôve noticed ISFJ‚Äôs can do), and when I‚Äôve been able to talk to her about them, she said she takes her time growing in those feelings. 

Our differences in that kind of communication are something we‚Äôve talked about openly, and I respect who she is and how she approaches relationships, but sometimes I feel like I have to read the signs and look back on moments to get a sense of just how she feels about me. 

Knowing all this, I actually told her a couple weeks ago that I love her. Not that I knew or expected she‚Äôd say it back to me, but just to tell her that‚Äôs where I am at. I checked in with her a few days ago and she told me though she has feelings for me, she‚Äôs not at the point to call it love. She said she acknowledges that it must be frustrating to be in my position, and said she worries that if she never gets to that point and we don‚Äôt work out, that lack of reciprocity would be especially hurtful on my end. 

Though I don‚Äôt think about that kind of scenario, I understand from her side that may be a thing she worries about since I‚Äôve been so open about my feelings for her. She knows to not take my telling her I love her for granted, and I told her I‚Äôm really patient, and just want to keep enjoying however she ‚Äúloves‚Äù me as we grow in this relationship. She told me she really appreciates me letting her go at her own pace. 

What dating advice does the ISFP community have for someone who is dating an ISFP who is much more expressive/open about their feelings? How can I  support her feelings/making her feel safe in her feelings? Any advice on how to maintain confidence in how she feels about me when I get little verbal feedback?

isfp,"I was curious to know how functions manifest in you and how do you know they are on the right positions in stack. How did you discover them and know they are what they are?  


Mine seems to be like this:

**Fi:** Search for identity and my true, natural, authentic desires is my general preoccupation from the very beginning of life.  I value my own personal space and tent to be furiously individualistic, but from time to time tend to be not as good at valuing others space, mostly when I'm angry. I am almost sure its my dominant.  


**Te:** I am a little bit obsessivly preoccupied with straight and logical systems. If you think of a character it MUST be as logical in his story as it can be, if it is composition in art that is desighned to be aligned in triangle it MUST be precise, not ""mostly triangle"". I love beatiful systems. I am sometimes to punctual to the extent that being late causes me huge psychological discomfort. My schedule is not robotically perfect but I think I am very productive and self-disciplined when comparing to others. Doesnt sound like inferior.   


**Ni:** I often seek symbolism in things that exist in physical world. I want to see the world in unified and singular pattern. I often try to boil down and generalize things and hate when people are distructed by details. I feel like there must be some primodial idea that every thing in the world is child to. But is it my dominant? Nah I dunno.  


**Se:** So i'm not really a party animal or some kind of conventualy fun or adventurous kind. I'm not a fan of new things for the sake of novelty. I'm also not a tactile kind of being. On other hand I tend to be super vigilant and observant often times. When I enter the room I observe it unconciously and memorize all the things that can be significant. So when someone seeks for a book or something I can point him to it. When I was a child I noticed the smallest changes in my room. I found a lost jewelry at night in the grass almost instantly, keys in the football field, noticed a thief trying to steal from my friend. I almost never bump into people. I'm often being stunned by surrounding beauty and cant go past it. Can it be infirior in that way? Is it Se at all? Nah I dunno  


**PoLR Ne:** I see the world in black and white and have this blunt ram-like all or nothing straigtforward attitude. May it be Te?  


**PoLR Fe:** It seems that I am not the most empathetic human around the world.",1603955444

isfp,"Hi everyone!

I am an categorized, according to MBTI, as an ENTP 5w4. 

I just recently started dating a girl around October 5th and I had her take the MBTI test, and she was classified as an INFJ, which is an excellent matchup for an ENTP like me.

However her behavior confuses me because it's like she has elements of a healthy INFJ (insatiable curiosity, always asking questions, wanting to have the perfect relationship, sensitive/caring), but also the qualities I would expect of an ISFP (very artistic, soaks in her surroundings sensory wise, up for new experiences, caring, supportive).

I really like her a lot, she brings out my Fe side (ENTP- 1.) Ne 2.) Ti 3.) Fe 4.) Si), so I'm less of a playful smart-ass around her, and debating philosophically.

I know the way you can tell is by looking at cognitive functions to tell what somebody is, and with ISFPs, their secondary/auxiliary function is Extroverted Sensing, which is the inferior/last function of an INFJ. So extroverted sensing is a lot higher up and more dominant functions for ISFPs as opposed to INFJs.

There's a possibility she could be an ISFJ, but she doesn't look like somebody uses introverted sensing (Si).

so I'm going to strive her behavior a little bit and please tell me if this sounds like any of you guys.

1.) She's quiet, reserved, very well mannered and polite

2.) when she's in a new setting we're surrounding she soaks everything in like a sponge in water, sensory wise. She can point out distinct individual sensations or stimuli in her surroundings. Like for example if she's in a forest she can pinpoint certain noises and tell you what they are or pinpoint certain details she notices.

3.) She's open-minded and willing to try new experiences.

4.) She has a fear of not knowing what to say in social situations.

5.) She's very artistic in nature, and loves new settings and surroundings. She has the heart for adventure.

6.) She's very caring and supportive, and empathetic. She can feel things very deeply, and can sense when something's off.

Does that sound like an ISFP to you?

We became rly close friends. See I don't know if I'm misunderstanding this but she rly talks to me a lot..and I mean A LOT for someone who has classes completely on different floors, we meet up at least 5 times a day.
She comes by to give me gifts or food and I started doing the same for her. I don't know if she's just naturally kind or it's a sign she likes me.

She's rly touchy, we're almost always holding hands, hugging, etc. But that could also be platonic (since we're both girls, but don't worry she likes girls too)

We actually were walking to the dorms at night and the stars were out, she told me it was a really romantic setting and me being me, joked that ""if it was a romantic setting shouldn't I be with a lover and not you?"" (I know...facepalm)

Naturally, we jive on the functions that we share. We love our alone time, reading, and loose schedules. That's all gravy.

How do I relate to and compensate for her Si function? On this one thing, we couldn't be more different. I organize information into abstract categories and probabilities. A whole world takes place inside my head. Thought experiments are fun for me and a chore for her.

Example I gave her: If she is handed a puzzle toy and told nothing about it, she wants to read the instructions, hold it in her hand, and ask ""What is its purpose?"" to figure out how it works. I, on the other hand, just look at it and use process of elimination to exclude what it isn't, down to a few possibilities to the point where I basically have a good guess before I even touch it. Neither of us understands the other's thought process.

Now, we've been together long enough that I notice when we're interpreting something differently and I go for clarification. Thing is, I can't wrap my head around how she gathers information. I'm a really stereotypical INTP. Abstraction is my playground. Sometimes, I can be literal, but she dwarfs me.

So, what I'm asking is this: How do I communicate better with someone who requires explicit details to faithfully convey a message, when I see explicit explanations as patronizing? Help me understand how you filter information and make judgments.",1603897236

basically, I took the test from 16personalities and I got ISFP twice, though the ISFJ fits me really well. though I wouldn't say I'm as organized and sensing as they are? I'm not sure. actually, I'm not so sure whether I'm an ISFJ or an ISFP.

you see, I am pretty organized when it comes to my belongings. my room is usually very organized and I always make sure that it is aesthetically pleasing, such as my computer desktop. I can barely start working when it's not perfect. 

however, the way I plan my life overall and how I work is very inconsistent. I don't think planning is necessary for lots of things bc sometimes it stops us from doing it, yk? for example, during class, I barely pay any attention and draw on my notebook all the time bc I can work without doing that. whenever I have to study for an exam, I cover the subject in a sitting a few days before the test. when I study, however, everything needs to be perfect, otherwise I won't be able to focus. i'd say that, generally, I'm pretty organized, but not so much when compared to XXXJs? my sister is an INFJ-A, for example, and she frequently says that she wishes she were as calm as I am regarding important decisions and events.

so.... my life overall is very inconsistent, but the actions theirselves are consistent and organized, if that makes sense!

I also see that ISFJs are more inclined to exact sciences. although I am good at them, I've always been much more inclined to human sciences, such as sociology, philosophy and especially visual arts &amp; language arts. I'm an artist and I've always been the weird, quiet kid that likes to draw - although not so much lately because I have been trying to socialize. well, not that ISFJs can't be like this, it's just that I expect my intuition to be more embracing than the one of an ISFJ, considering that this is their smallest function.

I told mine to tell him that we could switch toys, which he happily agreed.

I remember hugging the bunny and crying for a long time. In fact I'm pretty sure it's one of the few toys that I still keep. I also remember that my father was heavily and vocally disappointed that not only I offered my toy away for a ""girly"" one, but I was also ""crying like a girl"" over it.

I just don't like it when I feel that my character is being attacked. 

Recently I was misjudged by an ISFJ, and by recently I mean in the last couple of months not super recently. 

ISFJ is a very nice girl, but that one time of her making a judgement on my character has caused me this intense anger, like it's not enough for her to apologize. I need to fully, 100%, prove that she's wrong about me. 

The misunderstanding was over a very serious topic. In short we were set to RP, and I based my character's crush off of my real life fiance, who is a different race than I am. Well she didn't know that, and having a friend who had been through racism masquerading as a fetish, she basically thought I was doing the same thing. 

After she met my fiance, and we spoke more she came to be deeply apologetic for her accusations, and has owned up to the fact that she was speaking emotionally due to what her other friend has been through, and that she should've kept her mouth shut without knowing all of the relevant information. 

I do believe that she's being genuine, and I really at least logically want to move on. I think she was being emotional, and that in her heightened emotional state she said something that she regrets.

The problem is now I'm being emotional. I wasn't misjudged on something small. It's not like we went out to lunch and she assumed I was a light eater, and then I chowed down on a full course meal. She more or less accused me of racism. 

Every time I feel like I'm ready to move on this little voice in my head is like; ""She thinks you're racist, and disapproves of your relationship!""

And then I just get mad again.

A little bit ago there was a misunderstanding. INFP didn't have all the facts and said some hurtful stuff, that made ISFP lose a tremendous amount of trust/respect for them. 

Now the thing is logically ISFP understands that INFP was just being stupid. They're logically aware that INFP was talking with their feelings, and said something stupid without having the facts.

However, every apology INFP has tried to give falls flat. ISFP even told me; ""I really do want to forgive her, but all of her apologies feel empty. It's like she's saying sorry on reflex, without the actual intention behind it.""

I spoke with INFP and they've told me that they really are sorry, and feel really horrible about what they said. 

I believe both of them. I think the INFP truly is sorry, and remorseful, but the ISFP is reading their apology as just words. I think the ISFP friend feels like the INFP is just giving a barebones apology to try and smooth things over.

An overview of the gamma quadra in socionics (model A)/MBTI. The delta quadra types are SEE (in MBTI ESFP), ILI (in MBTI INTJ), LIE  (in MBTI ENTJ) and ESI (in MBTI ISFP).

(- Fi)  = Minimization of negative relationships and experiences. Critical of evil. Desire to get away from bad people and poor relationships, as well as to protect themselves from enemies and adversaries. 

(- Te)  = Business logic of risk and entrepreneurship. Rejection of which is useless, insignificant, mundane. This aspect is valued as more important than accumulation and rational consumption. 

(+Se) = Well capable of defending itself and its position. Protectiveness. Ability to defend themselves against all force. Ability to retain that which was acquired. Social mission of purification (to be understood in both the literal and the figurative sense of the word). Restorers of distorted principles, doing all that's necessary to remove barriers and obstacles which limit rapid advancement. This quadra can be called the quadra of criticism and reform. 

(+ Ni)  = constraining their hot temper, these sociotypes prefer to advance gradually into the future, though they may sharply reject obsolete ideas, criticizing past mistakes. Advancing step by step, they generally believe in the linearity of development, i.e. according to their deep convictions, it is only necessary to remove obstacles, remnants of the past, and immediately this will open endless possibilities for growth. This quadra is not afraid of chaos and upheavals: they know how to conduct their work under conditions of change, risk and confusion.

isfp," 

So  i'm male and 21, she is 18,we have been together for almost 11 months,  our relationship started really great,i am adhd,infp and she is isfp, i  met her in my dungeon dragons group, im her first boyfriend and she  always loved sex and hugs, everything was going well till covid-19  entered in our life and locked us down, then, i couldn't see her at all  in real because of her parents, it was going fine in the first months,  school had stopped and we had lot of time to talk, play video games  together and have virtual sex. Then, she got a full-time job and started  talking to me less and less, sometimes looking cold  and then i started  being a little negative and trying to find solutions to be allowed to  see her asking questions like, do she miss me too? She said she don't  really miss me, she is satisfied alone and has always been like this,  she don't usually miss people, love having her space,  just returning to  her normal state( i clearly remember she used to miss me before she got  busy and she had days where she really wanted to do things with me )  Although she said she wanted to keep trying because we had really good  moments together and want to see what would happen to us in the future,  some days later, she said she think she isn't meant to be in a  relationship but don't really know yet what she should do, we spent some  days without talking and then she stopped being full-time cause school  started soon and some days later she said she think it was just a phase  because she was too busy and then she started getting a little warmer  again but still not quite yet, at one point covid slowed down and i was  alloed to see her again 3 weeks long, and then i really got her back for  this moment she returned to be the lovely gf she was before and she  always looked happy while with me and then covid returned and i was once  again forbidden to see her, she was also busy with school and then i  started losing her again after some time, yesterday i saw her at school  by luck cause she was on my path she was on her  phone and didn't notice  me before i said hi to her, i still saw her girl-in-love eyes, i'm  highly intuitive and would not have felt positive emotions with her if i  didn,t feel love, i hugged her quick cause i did not have a lot of time  and she hugged me back and i felt the love wave,  a little bit later i  texted her it really made me happier for the day to hug her a little, i  asked her if she was happy too, she said i kinda made her jump and would  have loved more if i wasn,t that quick, i apologized and asked if i see  her again by luck at school if we could talk longer and maybe go walk  outside school (i don't really know 100% if it's 100% her parents that  prevent me to see her or if she is really lawful on the rules), she said  we will see, i don't really liked her answer, we had this conversation:

i  said to her these times i don,t really know how i should act with her,  explained her why, said what i view in how she act with me(she said to  me early in the relationship that she don't always understand her  emotions, i sometimes think she might be asperger)

she said : i don't know, i don't really feel like it,

i answered: feel like what?,

she said: i don,t know,

i answered: in brief, you don't really know how you feel right now?

she  answered: i just feel good at my house, with myself, it's all, i don't  need to do things with people or have physical contact, just talking  with friends, it's fine. (i think it kinda might be stockholm syndrome,  considering her parents are really harsh since the pandemic, they just  want her to go to school or work or stay home alone, i remembered she  loved doing things with people before also, she loved dnd, boardgames or  gaming partys with our friends)

I  said: i don't understand, it's always going well when we really have  time to see each other, last year you also wanted to invite people to  your birthday, at one moment you wanted to go but finally you stayed

Her:Last year it wasn't the same, i had not as much friends than now.

Me: You said you had been too busy, it might be the same no?

Her:  I don't know, i think i might just not be made for a romantic  relationship because even if i would not be in couple, i would be happy,  not the end of the world, i did not felt the need to get a boyfriend,  it's like, not necessary to my life

Me(i  got kind of angry): Ok, i leave you alone but i don't understand right  now and i think you forgotten something, i don't feel like i known you  like this even if you don't notice it yourself, your personality type  make you live more in the moment i recall really well the last time i  saw you, you wasn't like this

Her: thing is you didn't know me for this long

Me: yes but we had covid since that time and it changed you. Listen, think, i shut up.

Her: In fact, it's when we started being in couple that i changed, now, i'm back to normal

Me: at the same time, it's not a poorly done hug that mean everything, you don't rememeber some weeks ago? Well, go

Her:It's not because of the hug

Me:  At what you say me, i feel really dumb giving you my heart and letting  you keep it. But at how i remember how you act when we are really   together, it's the opposite. I might be a fucking idiot but i think it's  you that don't understand yourself anymore to change everytime like  this. You went away with the covid after a few months and you came back  when we met again and now you go away because we couldn't see each other  in weeks again, how do you want me to endure a long-distance  relationship?

Her:I don't know, fuck

Me:  I think it's losing contact that is the problem, well sorry for getting  mad at you but i want to help you understand yourself. Anyway, im going  to play video games.

Her: No, you're right to be angry, i realize i'm selfish in love.

Me:It's  not that you're selfish, it's that you struggle keeping a link and if i  trust my intuition, i feel that you love me when we are together, i  almost always feel who fit me and who does not fit me in a relationship,  i always recognized people that don't respect others at high school and  i would never have went in couple with you if i didn't feel a  compatibility,also you don't give your body like this to everybody at  start like we did, to do this, you must have felt compatibility too.  Let's go im letting you think rn

Her:You're right, but what i mean is that it's my first relationship, i'm still discovering

Me: Not a problem, but don't fool me plz

Her:No, i try to know what i really want

Later  in the evening, she sent me memes like usual, before she go sleep, i  said: even if you can't always meet my expectations, it's not serious, i  hold on to you no matter what(the first time something like this  happened she said she don't like when people expect things from her,  that's why i said this, i think she might just feel bad to not be able  to be perfect for me, i know i might never be 100% satisfied in  love,infp like me have unrealistic expectations in love sometimes cause  our feels are too intense) she said ok with a smile emoji and then said:  i once again played too much genshin impact xd

i answered: lol xd and then i said her this in addition cause i still recalled what happened earlier

me:you  must not feel bad about it, i think it's just a pass once again cause  school ask a lot from you( she is studying natural sciences), it's a  little bit like when you worked full time, it should fix when we can see  each other again normally or when session will be over ;)

her:  maybe, but i must put more efforts in my studies, i still have not  studied that much, i procrastin too much xd, anyway, good night (she put  a kiss emoji like usual, like if nothing happened, was it just an  emotion spike?did i find the right words to fix the situation?) I also  said good night, i love you and she answered i love you too so it's  probably not done yet

Today she  didn't text me really but it's not uncommon with her since genshin  impact released, she plays a lot of it, been like this for most of the  last days before that and even then, she had times like this before when  she was busy, she just replied to the memes i sent her and probably did  her homeworks and then played genshin impact she said me good night  with a kiss tonight too.

Can you  guys or girls  help me understand what is happening with my girlfriend  right now and maybe suggest me things to do? I love her to death and i  would do everything i can to save our relationship, i just need advice.  Thanks!",1603358115
isfp,"When i joined the enfp subreddit 2 months ago, i got kinda ""annoyed"" by some posts, and couldnt relate alot of what was getting posted there.

isfp,"This may seem like a strange question, but as an ISFP I‚Äôm curious how those of you that have gone through failure or been in deeply in debt before have handled it emotionally and mentally.

I‚Äôm 24 and graduated college last December. While I was in college I built a very large marketing agency. At the top we had hundreds of clients. I had 6 full time employees and the business was doing $38,000 a month. 

I made a lot of mistakes and had some bad luck. Basically I expanded way too fast and wasn‚Äôt putting any money away. I was reinvesting every penny. 

What I wasn‚Äôt prepared for is that there was a sudden change in the main platform we built the business on. When they unexpectedly made changes to the platform we could not fulfill the service clients paid for. 

I did the right thing and refunded every client. But, because we burned so much cash expanding (I wasn‚Äôt even paying myself anything since I was living with my expenses and had minimal expenses) there was nothing left for refunds. 

So I took out loans and went into debt to make everything right. 

I‚Äôll be 25 in January. I‚Äôm $57,000 in debt and just can‚Äôt get past it mentally and even emotionally. 

I closed the business a year ago in August and am just so emotionally burned out. 

The thing is I have worked out very, very long term payment plans worked out to everyone I owe.

It will take me 3 years to pay everything off if I just pay the minimum each month. 

I live with my parents and have been keeping this a secret from them. There‚Äôs no reason for them to know. They are very well off but financially they can‚Äôt help me and their worry on top or my worry will just make things exponentially worse. 

Every time the phone rings I jump.

I guess what I‚Äôm looking for are stories from those of you that have been in debt before and how you recovered and coped along the way.",1603318947

isfp,"**I apologize for the extremely long post ahead, but my battle to discover my type has been constant and unending, and I wanted to be completely transparent so that I could discover my true type. I would be grateful for any insights at all.**

I have contemplated this so many times over the past year. My mind feels weary and I don't know who I am anymore. Thousands of cognitive functions racing throughout my mind and yet my heart still feels stranger to me, and I constantly keep wondering who I am. The dazzling need to find, to unlock, to know, had haunted me for years. I don't even know how to begin. But ever since stumbling into the world of MBTI, I have felt this desperate need to pinpoint myself, and it's unending. I first tested as an INFP, and I felt so known, so illuminated. The puzzle pieces fit together and I felt like I finally had the words to capture my heart and mind and why since birth I have always felt Martian in this world.

But I when somebody suggested the possibility of being an ISFP to me, it was as if my eyes had awakened. I restlessly pondered who I really was and suddenly the cognitive functions seemed so much more complex, so much more elusive. I would spend years over analyzing my every memory, my every emotion. My mind feels so barren and foreign to me now. I have contemplated every single type, but my home always felt like INFP. Everything-the shimmering need for meaning, the feelings of isolation, the quenching mind, the poetic spirit-but then I realized I could recognize so many glimmers of ISFP in myself. Now I feel so conflicted. Deep down I truthfully don't want to let go of my INFP identity because it is so special to me-it has become my home. But something inside of me is restlessly whispering, telling me that maybe ISFP is the true me. And I realized I was hiding from that because I didn't want to sacrifice my home as an INFP. But if this is who I truly am-I recognize that you are a beautiful community of searching hearts like my own, and if I am one of you-I want to be open to the notion. I think that all along I might have been ridden my the illusion that I was an INFP when my purest self was an ISFP-or truthfully, any other type. I don't know how to share my thoughts, so I will share my entire story.

I began life as a delicate and delightful child. I sparkles with life at home. I would constantly ask questions, I was restless and curious. But at home I was so different than the girl I was in the outside world. I felt alone and misunderstood, and isolated in a world that infused me with bitterness. It lead me to feeling so unloved and so unseen, and kindled a chain of darkness that would bind me for years to come-growing disenchanted with humans and boiling with hatred, so narrow-minded. I fell into whirlpools of gossip. I was so lost and so broken, and I never understood how deeply my actions pierced others. But deep down I had a pure heart. I wanted to give and to heal and to transform. But I also fell into traps of shallowness. I spent hours focusing on the world of fashion, believing I needed to be beautiful to be worthy, and I was so obsessed with my appearance. The girl with the poetic heart had been buried my a monstrous and blind girl, and I would spend time saying things about others that were destructive and wrong because I was a people pleaser. But my heart was an avalanche of burning and intimate emotions that I always felt inside of me, magnifying, and when I surrendered myself to God he molded them into beautiful pillars of light that I would discover again through the gift of writing. Through Him, I was transformed and I became new again. I found the girl enchanted with the universe and so alive with hope. And even though I am still so broken, so flawed, so empty-in Him I understand how very beautiful I am.

While I have always tested high on intuition and low on sensing, when I probed deeper into the universe of MBTI however, I began to question my Ne usage. My Ni was almost my high as my Fi-I was so compelled by the mysterious and the occultic, drawn to enigmatic secrets and conspiracy theories, when I find a story that pulls me in I could get lost in it forever, intoxicating. I also see people as endlessly fascinating and could spend hours on the internet researching about them if they intrigue me, seeking to understand them on a deeper level. I have always wanted to understand the colors of the rainbow and the language of the families and the secrets of ghosts.

But-then I realized that I also have many tangible talents. Although I am horribly uncoordinated and despise physical intensity, such as rollercoasters or ziplines, and the feeling of danger horrified me-I have always had a natural and intimate understanding of colors and fashion and patterns and how they intertwine. I find foods divine and could get lost in the warm waters of a shower forever, because they seem to drape over me in a spellbinding way. As a child I had an obsession with sparkles because they caught my breath with their beauty, kindling in me a crystal obsession that spanned over months. I love nature so much-the stunning ocean of autumn leaves and the ghostlike feeling of bare trees touch me, and my eyes feel insatiable drawn to twilight skies. As a child I was so horribly clumsy that my janitor teased me, much to my chagrin, but when I poured myself into ballet-my body molded to the music in a strange and destined way, melting into it almost effortlessly. I could never understand why people loved sports so much, but I found dancing so beautiful. I experience gut feelings and can sometimes predict when something dangerous will occur in a novel. I also sometimes seek to find the answers to the future through my surroundings, searching for signs in the world around me. I believe in fate and destiny and that God can use the physical world to illuminate what will be. I also have quite eerily good pitch and a connection to details. People watching is so fascinating to me and I love observing the world around me, shimmering in its nakedness, trying to understand it. I also am not sure if my imagination is vivid enough to be an INFP-while my mind loves to slip into stories, they are very rarely complex and defined fantasy worlds, simply thoughts that capture me. Also, I was a rather impulsive child-in middle school, I remember opening a locker with a paper clip because I had read about in a book, knowing it was wrong, and yet defeated by my curiosity. I would also float in my own realm of being, drawing on tables in elementary school. I also am not spectacular with brainstorming-I have always harbored a very delicate insecurity about my creativity, which lead me to cling to preexisting ideas because my mind with freeze with fear for group projects, which could shed light on a lack of Ne.

However, at the same time, I am not sure if I very much live in the moment. I find the present so beautiful and believe it is a gift, but I vividly remember times in my childhood that I would spoil holidays because of my inability to immerse myself in the present. Once we traveled to another continent for thanksgiving, but I spent most of it excitedly fantasizing about Christmas because it was so much special to me, which irritated my mom. And the past-it always echoes with me. Although I am enchanted by the idea of living in the moment, my memories claps themselves onto me, sometimes leaving me drowned in sorrow and unforgiveness for myself and others. When I write, when I dip into the world of my memories, it comes alive with a bittersweetness that was always tucked into me. My relationship with future is a very twisted one. I have never had one path but it still is a gem to me-I still idealize the belief that one day everything can transform and the idea of tomorrow, despite our shattering world, I still so desperately yearn for the future even though I have never had a stark plan or vision for it-it is dusted with endless questions.

In the end I feel so lost. Maybe I am not any of these types at all, maybe I am a completely different type lost in her shadow. But something inside of me keeps echoing ISFP-and maybe this is the true me. When I see art I feel mesmerized by the colors. The scents and sights of this world enthrall me and I treasure it all deeply-even though I might not take the initiative to do so as much as others. In my heart I feel this might be my true place. Even though I have always tested as intuitive, maybe I have been blind to the sensory side of me. Maybe this is the core of my being. Do any ISFPs relate to my story? Is this the answer that I have been searching for? My hope that I will fully understand myself keeps waning. I feel I am a perceiver at heart but then wonder if I am a Fe dom, then I believe I use Ni and I wonder if it is truly Ne. This boiling agony never seems to end-could this be a Fi-Ni loop? Is this my true home? Any thoughts at all would be appreciated.",1603257411

He insulted me and said it was my fault for him to feel like that and etc. When I only treated him like a normal human being and a friend, since im kind. Days after, he apologize. Everything okay until last night.
He actually begged me to, at least, go on a date .-. (My country doesnt allow to go out, hes talking about next year)
I've just said no, i would not make him an illusion for a yEAR so no. I told him i'm trying something with another guy, so I've alredy made a decision. He told me his gonna be depressed and stuff, i said thats not my fault, i've been honest since i notice his feelings towards me.

isfp,"So ISFPs are generally very accepting of everyone and do not judge people in anyway. This probably confuses them about what they like or dislike in a person. So do they go with physical attraction in order to decide in the spur of moment? Or do they think about personality in the long run?

Do they need to be gently pushed into making these decisions? Or are they very headstrong about this and know what they want and what they don't want?

My question is why do the ISFPs run away if they like someone (she has constantly been saying she likes me as a person)? Is their shyness rooted in vulnerability?

*  Drinks and experiments with every drug imaginable 
* He has said suicidal things before (although I hear this is common for ISFPs?)

He's nice enough as a person but constantly makes poor life choices. Our family is very SJ and NT heavy so I also feel he's kinda alienated from people. He's emotional and others in the family are put off by strong emotions.

isfp,"Hi,

To begin with I would like to indicate that I am from Spain and I moved 7 months ago to Atlanta, GA, USA. However, due to the pandemic the immigration services are stopped and I still do not have my work permit even though it is in process.

I am 30 years old and I have always worked in Customer Service in different sectors:

\- Airports

\- Hotels

\- Contact/Call Center

\- Amazon

\- Account management

I finished high school, but never finished college or university, so I can say I have no specific training in anything.

Although I have never had any vocation, I will leave you with more information about me so that you can help me. I will be very grateful, really.

My main work personality traits are (in that order):

\* Behaviour analytical

\* Practical

\* Self-confident

\* Decisive

\* Autonomous

\* Challenging

\* Flexible

\* Rational

\* Resourceful

\* Fair

Industries of interest (I don't have to work in those sectors even though they are of interest to me.)

\- Transport and logistics

\- Computing and technology

\- Security and emergency services

\- Tourism and leisure

\- Government, law and politics

\- Healthcare

Considering studying in a Trade School is complicated by the cost of schools in the United States and the fact that I need to work. Also, most of them ask for some scores that I would have to manage with my school in Spain and then validate it here, I would also have to pass a test before entering the school, and at my age I could not pass it since I do not remember many of the subjects taught, obviously.

As an additional fact, I can say that I really like working with computers (it doesn't mean that I like programming or anything like that, but that I like the computer as a work tool). I feel very comfortable with it and I usually stand out for it. When I worked at Amazon we had a series of metrics to meet and I was number 1 worldwide in Average Handling Time due to my speed and efficiency.

(I put that as an aptitude of mine and without any ego of any kind)

Other professions of my interest, besides the use of computers as tools (which I know is not a profession per se) is the airport sector. I have always been interested in airlines and working for one of them. Flight Attendant I understand that it is a very good job in the United States and it pays very well. Although now with the pandemic the airlines are in a critical situation and it is not the best idea.

Indicate that I am looking for a job that allows me to live decently. I aspire to 20$-30$/hr although I am aware that I will start earning less due to the current situation we are all in and that I have just immigrated to a new country for me. (start from 0).

Finally, I did several times MBTI tests and the result is always ISFP or ISFP-A. So I am definetly looking for a job where my personality type fits in it.

She once had a legal situation happen involving someone close to her betraying her by getting her to lend him a huge sum of money (talking thousands), just for him to use it all up and lie about what happened. Although most people would either sue or at least expect repayment, she let it go because she didn‚Äôt want to cause his situation to get any more difficult for him and wanted to keep things as peaceful as she could.

¬∑ Super hardworking and ambitious when it comes to her dreams and what she‚Äôs passionate about. She practices for things until very late at night and even while brushing her teeth, she continues to practice

¬∑ Took a huge risk moving to another country at a young age without knowing how to speak the language because she wanted to pursue her dream career in that country

¬∑ Big spender; often spends on many items while shopping and when stuck between two choices, she chooses to buy both

¬∑ Enjoys sleeping all day, watching Netflix, and staying home to play with her cats. If she does go out, it‚Äôs usually to eat at a restaurant or take photos with her various cameras.

¬∑ Believes it‚Äôs important to make sure you know what you really want to do and do it because if not now, then when? She thinks you should push forward with what you want to do.

¬∑ Makes the most out of things, has really great positive energy, and has a very radiant smile that makes other people smile just by looking at it. 

¬∑ Hardly ever gets angry and never yells at people. Typically just stays quiet if she‚Äôs mad.

¬∑ Not good at verbally expressing how she feels, but is a very emotional person who cries at many things including movie scenes where she doesn‚Äôt even understand what‚Äôs happening

¬∑ Often will try not to cry because once she does start crying, it takes her a long time to stop. However she‚Äôs not good at holding in her tears, especially once she sees something touching or when she sees another person crying.

¬∑ She‚Äôs a really shy person, but is also bubbly and cheerful. You won‚Äôt catch her feeling sad often. She gets especially shy with crushes and embarrasses herself around them easily.

¬∑ Really generous with people she cares for. She once gave a dance instructor fruits and said she had to hurry before the fruits lose its freshness.

¬∑ She has a really good memory, especially if she sees it. She also can remember things you tell her about yourself quite easily.

¬∑ Enjoys making jokes and teasing her friends. She‚Äôs also really easygoing, so everyone loves making fun of her and joking at her expense because she never takes it seriously.

¬∑ She has worries about things like not being a good role model for the younger people around her like nephews and nieces. Although everything finds her great, she often has thoughts in her head like if she isn‚Äôt doing something good enough or if she messes up and looks bad for those around her, etc.

¬∑ When asked about her wishes, she said she wishes that the people she loves are healthy, hoped that she can experience new things in the future, and be happy with the people she‚Äôs with now for a long time",1602916421

Some of you may have already heard of it (and know that our first version was actually barely usable). I wanted to let you know about it because we've made a lot of improvements since then and thought you'd be interested in trying it out.

Like many of us, we're hardcore MBTI lovers and enthusiasts and thought it strange that no MBTI app existed yet. We thought MBTI could fix a few problems with current dating apps.

For one, you are recommended people you‚Äôre statistically likely to love and understand effortlessly, instead of being forced to meet every single type of person. Second, you can save time, money, and emotional fatigue you would have spent on bad dates with no chemistry on other dating apps. Third, you can deeply understand each other‚Äôs personalities before you meet and in a way that was never possible before. And fourth, get in-depth dating advice and insight into how to attract and get along with anyone.

[Boo Telepathy Demo](https://i.redd.it/5o8hirvx6vs51.gif)

Many of our users are using the app to make friends and foster deeper, more meaningful connections. We pretty much built this app for people like us, so I'd love to get your feedback on how we can make it better.

The app is completely free to use, with added features like Dating Telepathy that are part of a premium membership (to support our operations).

You can download the app through the Apple App Store and Google Play Store links on our website: [https://boo.dating](https://boo.dating/)

Hi all, ISFP here with a history of leaving jobs less than 12 months and not a whole lot of interview experiences...  


I am currently working part-time (\~10 months) and going to school.  


Recently I have been planning to quit my job either to:   


(A) focus on my full-time studies (to finish my AA then program) but worrying how I am going to pay for tuition ...and will have to stay with parents until 4+ schooling (not ideal; it‚Äôs a pretty toxic environment to stay in...)  


(B) get a full-time job (need to the up my financial resources to move out on my own or with my boyfriend)  


Well, I‚Äôve been jumping back and forth but am leaning towards plan B...because I realized that how much I absolutely loathe the structure of school and having to do it all over again...just rethinking if I really want to power through 4+ years of studies (..if I am completely honest, I am doing it for the mostly the pay/money...am quickly learning how debilitating it is for my mental/emotional health if anything...) I‚Äôll put this path in the back-burner for now...   


Nothing wrong with my current workplace; overall a great practice and my boss is a really cool/laid back but there‚Äôs not much room for growth/getting really bored with my job...I don‚Äôt see myself staying more than 1 year.   


Questions:   


*- Would it be too early to start applying to new jobs right now?*  


I‚Äôve started job hunting but waited out on applying for now (mostly because I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll end up shooting myself in the foot with poorly throughout choices/plans...) so that my school semester will end in early December and could focus on full time job.   


*- What should I tell my boss if I wanted to quit?*   


Not sure how to word on my quitting without burning bridges and staying professional...I had originally plan on telling her that ‚ÄòI am leaving the job is to focus on my studies‚Äô but have a bad feeling about lying (if my new employer decides to contact with my boss for a background check, it‚Äôll bite me in the butt)...so, thinking of telling her ‚ÄòI‚Äôve change my mind and decided moving out is my best option‚Äô...  


*- Are companies usually flexible with the¬† start date for at least 2 months out?*   


I guess it really depends but ideally, I would want to wait until my 12 months mark with my current employer (resume purposes) and school will be out of the way too.¬†

 

So yeah, if you were in my shoes, how would you go about this? 

Advice would be greatly appreciate, thank you for reading my rambling!¬†",1602574642

isfp,"I feel like ISFPs (especially those who had a rougher upbringing) have a tendency to conceal and hide their emotions, and since they don't live them out in the open, they might appear and even think of themselves as thinkers (I know I did). It takes a very good understanding of Fi and how it functions to understand that it's their dominant function. 

Similarly, while they're sensors, they tend to have very rich internal worlds, which at first might make it difficult to relate to the definition of sensors, and end up mistyped as intuitives.

Of course a healthy individual shouldn't be mistyped that off, but we don't really live in the pinnacle of mankind's mental health.

At an earlier  point in our conversation, he had said that he ‚Äúalways does what he says he‚Äôll do.‚Äù So I took his word for it. Part of the issue is that he lives an hour away, as an isfp he probably wants to date someone who‚Äôs there every day. I can‚Äôt be. However he offered to come meet me where I am for our first date, and the second one I drove to see him. It was all so natural and wonderful, honestly. And the way he looked at me and smiled was so sweet. On the 30th, he texted out of the blue and said ‚ÄúHey you. I know it's getting a bit late but I just wanted to let you know I hadn't forgotten about you. I hope you're doing well and aren't too stressed out with school over there.‚Äù I had told him that I like it when people text back/are good at verbal communication, so he said he‚Äôd try his best at doing better at texting. 

We‚Äôve texted on and off briefly since then, but he takes a few days to respond to mine. As an infj it‚Äôs very frustrating to me. I‚Äôve had multiple guys I thought were interested ghost me, and say they were ‚Äúbusy.‚Äù 

Well, after four days of him not responding to me, tonight I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore and said ‚Äúhey ____, hope you‚Äôre doing well.‚Äù He responded shortly thereafter and said ‚ÄúI am, just really busy and I have been stressing myself out a bit with school. You doing okay?‚Äù

Everyone is fucking busy, buddy. If he was interested, surely he would have fucking planned a damn date by now? Or am I just overreacting? The thought of him being just like all the douche bags before him makes me literally tear up. I really like him so far and I don‚Äôt want to fuck this up. 

Part of me wants to be candid and say ‚Äúif you‚Äôre not interested anymore, please just say so now.‚Äù 

He was clearly into me, it was unmistakeable. So I‚Äôm just at a loss right now. I want to believe him that he is busy, but I‚Äôm in graduate school and he‚Äôs in undergrad, so there‚Äôs no way he‚Äôs busier than me, and I can still take 10 seconds out of my day to text someone. 

It‚Äôs like torture because I don‚Äôt want to make him feel coerced into something he no longer wants, but I really want to see him again. He said he‚Äôd plan our next date, why hasn‚Äôt it happened yet? I feel like I‚Äôm going crazy. Any advice/comments are appreciated. Help.",1602484352

isfp,"Hello!

I'm not sure if this belongs here but I hope you could help me figure out what's going on.

So there's this online friend of mine, we knew each other for some time (like 4 years) but somehow never really 'clicked'. This summer we started to play games and talk more, we were like best friends for a few months, teasing each other and laughing for hours. We even met each other and had great time.

So then I started to feel overwhelmed with all of this, he was almost all the time talking to me, asking me everything I just felt hemmed in by him. I guess I backed out a little to get my space back, we still spent time together but I was maybe less enthusiastic in our conversations.
After that he started to act as like an enemy to me, 'hi' and 'bye' was everything I got from him, and in a very hateful voice. It hurt me as hell but well, I thought he had a bad day or something. After few days we started to chat again and it was all good.
After that whenever I go to play with some other guys he acts like this again, I'm trying to talk to him but he refuses, today he was acting like I was not there at all.

I have no idea what his reasons are, I didn't ask him about it but to be honest, I don't really want to when he's so cold, I'm scared of talking to him.

Do you guys had any situations like this? What could be a reason for this behaviour?  I was thinking that he maybe is jealous of me going to play games with other guys but idk... If that's true that sounds like he'd like to control me (in a way that whenever I play with him - he is nice to me) and I really hard the idea of it. 

Please, let me know what you think.",1602375952

Other times i just hold my stories and anecdotes inside. I feel like people are not interested, or that it just doesnt matter. There are conversations that i dont think about this at all, and that i just tell my stories when i feel like it.

I posted this in the ISTP thread and that left me with little no answers that satisfied me so I thought I would ask like minded people instead :)

My ex boyfriend (23m, istp) and I (22f, isfp) were together for a little over three years (doing a combination of living together and long distance). We got along really well and understood each other, in ways I can‚Äôt really explain. We had hopes of a future together and he meant a lot to me.

Things went south over the summer, and he began treating me poorly, which I later found out included cheating and lying. We fought and fought and tried to work it out until about a month ago when I decided it was best if we just did not contact. 

Earlier this week he texted me saying he misses talking to me/loves me, but doesn‚Äôt want a relationship with me. Basically just wants to have somewhat regular contact but not be in a committed relationship.

Basically I‚Äôm asking 

1. Am I insane for still having feelings for this guy regardless of the cheating and lying?

2. What should I do with regards to the relationship moving forward? It‚Äôs clear that an exclusive/committed relationship is not in the books for us, but how do you maintain a friendship with someone you still love?

isfp,"We've been dating for a little under a year and the past two months has been rough. We are always arguing about small things that turn into a bigger argument than it needs to be with hurt feelings on either side. We make up and it's good temporarily before it becomes a fight again. It doesn't seem like we are actually resolving and patterns keep repeating themselves. We've both acknowledged this is hurting both of us and we want to work through it but we don't know how.  I think at the crux of our arguing:

From his perspective:

\- I lack empathy and don't put myself in his shoes enough. I look at things through my perspective too much and it makes him feel unheard and unsupported.

From my perspective:

\- I think he doesn't take my feelings into account enough (but maybe because he doesn't understand? because of our POOR COMMUNICATION???). He wants to be able to communicate what he needs from me without risking offending me but the way he delivers his request can really affect how I react. I do take things personally and analyze it to the larger context of our relationship.

Is there something we can do or is this a lost cause? Are we two different and should just find other people that communicate more similarly so this doesn't happen? We weren't arguing like this prior to becoming exclusive if that makes a difference.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

our most recent fight: 

we recently made up and are hanging out just enjoying each others company. we go out for a slice of pizza and a donut (i love donuts and the beginning of our relationship we would do this together). we talk the next night on the phone and he says how he wants me to say no to donuts more often because he is working on getting healthier and food is a weakness for him. he had woken up that morning not feeling good after eating that food and wants me to say no and try and keep him accountable. based on my reaction he could tell i was disappointed and i got upset without really knowing why (yet). he was taken aback saying how he couldn't understand why I wouldn't support him in this because if roles were reversed he would do it for me. from my perspective - he originally told me that he allows himself to cheat once in awhile. i guess this has changed or doesn't apply to things like donuts. but what happens is now I feel like the things in the beginning that we found fun together (staying up late together, wining and dining, going out late at night to do random things like donuts) is now disappearing and with coronavirus i feel like there's not as much to do with the weather changing and things being closed. so my reaction was out of fear to not having fun anymore and the good stuff of our relationship going away. but he took my reaction as though I don't care for him and his goals. I apologized the next morning and is response was dry and logical and we're taking a few days to think about how we can communicate with each other better so this doesn't keep happening. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is this a lost cause or can something be done? I know writing it out it seems trivial but the consistency in which we are hurting each others feelings is becoming an issue and superseding the good times we have together.",1602252472
isfp,"Hello. I‚Äôm an isfj and I‚Äôve been with a wonderful isfp for 6 years. (5 years as long distance friends and less than a year ldr)

I love isfps. Your calm nature. Your listening skills. You aren‚Äôt really judgmental and you only judge a person when they aren‚Äôt behaving decently. I really feel like around every isfp I get this vibe ‚Äúbe yourself, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that. I will accept you‚Äù 

As a very turbulent and anxious isfj I really appreciate that.

A short insight on my experience with the isfp:

He‚Äôs really calm and a bit anxious. He loves fishing and camping but he isn‚Äôt really as adventurous as the typical isfp (turbulent). He has a circle of close friends but he gets along with everyone (such a gentle soul). He lives in the moment (Se) and always reminds me to ease up on the bad things that have happened before, whether recent or not (Si). He always reminds me to value myself (his Fi to my Fe) and I‚Äôm always there to understand why he‚Äôs sad or upset and know how to make him happy (My Fe to his Fi).

We‚Äôve got some problems too of course: 

We tend to bottle our negative feelings towards each other up. It ends up with both of us acting passive aggressively until it reaches the highest point. When it happens, I lose my temper and become furious. He becomes reclusive and unresponsive. 

The only things I wish he could improve on is sticking with plans and promises and more motivation for a better life.

My perfectionism has got to me, literally making ballet, which was something I used to love so dearly, something I dread.

To put it simply I really want to work on developing my Te beyond just using it for simple tasks.

See if you give me a practical task in the moment I am very capable of using it. If you give me any task that needs to be done and requires some kind of physicality plus organization my Se-Te really shines. 

However, I have no real ability to use my extroverted thinking in a long-term sort of view. And it honestly kind of ticks me off because well to put simply my mom got really lucky. 

For a very long time she wanted to open her own sewing shop. My mom is an amazing seamstress she can sew anything. However, that weak Te more or less held her back. 

And then she gets married to a wealthy, ESTJ guy and he literally just took care of all that for her and honestly it  kind of upsets me. 

He found her a storefront, he took care of the website design, he helped out with her marketing. 

And I'm like why can't someone do that for me? Why can't I find someone who's really good with all that organizational stuff come up to me and say ""Hey, I see that you want to start your own charity business I happen to know about running a business and I believe in your idea let's do it.""

I'm not trying to belly ache I just seriously wish that could happen. I just really wish that the initial startup of what I want to do someone would help me with it like someone would say okay I like your idea and I have the skills to help you do it.

My ISFP sister is a senior in college doing online school, and things have been going pretty trash.

She doesn‚Äôt come down from upstairs to talk much to the family who hangs out on the main floor for most of the day, and has been impulse-buying clothes and hiding/lying about her spending on clothes to my mom. We‚Äôve had stints of a few days where she throws a prolonged tantrum and will snap at anything we say and claim we are treating her like a child. She‚Äôs been seeing a therapist that my mom pays for appointment-by-appointment, but she doesn‚Äôt tell my mom about when she sees her, so my mom always pays late. She‚Äôs also pretty insistent on moving out next semester to stay w/ a friend, and said that it‚Äôs child abuse if my parents don‚Äôt let her (they‚Äôre hesustang due to if she gets COVID and has no way to get to hospital or brings it home to us who are at-risk).

isfp,"so.. I've been chatting with this really lovely girl for the last week and a half, over text but also met up 3 times now (coffee/drinks at bar plus walk/tea at my place). I'm fascinated by her as we share some similar ideas and thought concepts. she is an intellectual powerhouse and I really enjoy her company. But I am confused as to her feelings toward me. She constantly laughs and smiles at what I say, has directly complimented me a few times RE my intelligence, humour, attitude and outlook, has said she finds me very easy to be around and that she opens up to me which is very unusual for her (apparently she has very few actual close people, mainly just one female family member), texts me back long into the night (regularly says ""i need to sleep now"" but then keeps on texting me and says ""i can't put my phone away lol"") and has told me that she really enjoys spending time with me and would like to keep doing that (has also initiated two of the meet ups)

the confusing part - she texted me the other day to explain she had a busy day and mentioned within her text that she had arranged to call her boyfriend (who other than that one mention she has not spoken about at all in the 10 plus hours that she and I have been communicating in, I think he also lives abroad). She also seems to be shy and a little nervous physically around me - she does initiate some contact but seems to find safety in backing into a corner if we're sitting down together (i haven't been pushy with this at all, just tried to respect her space).

I play a lot of video games, but seeing as how I'm in control there, it doesn't feel as straining. I can go at my own pace and quit playing anytime, but with movies/shows I feel bad for not finishing, so it feels like a bigger commitment of my time.

isfp,"Hey y‚Äôall. I‚Äôm an infj (f24) and I‚Äôm really needing some insight/advice on how to go forward with my isfp crush (m23).

We met on a dating app and he made it clear he wanted to meet me, and that he wanted to come meet me where I lived an hour away. However, I had to be the one to actually plan our first date, which I didn‚Äôt mind. One thing that I noticed was that he didn‚Äôt really text me the whole week until it was the morning of our date, and he asked for the address of the place we were meeting. I didn‚Äôt worry too much about it since he seemed inteeested and I googled isfps and texting and, well, apparently they are known for not being great texters, lol. But I can handle that...

He drove nearly an hour to see me and we ended up spending around 5 hours together on the first date, it was so fun and low key and I felt totally comfortable with him. He was a gentleman the whole time, opened doors for me, paid for dinner, held the umbrella for me because it was raining, and he did these things all on his own. I told him to text me that he got home safe and he did, and then he said that he loved how the time flew by with me, and that he was ‚Äúdefinitely looking forward‚Äù to seeing me again. (I had already invited him over to make cookies in two days at my house because I just liked him that much, and I wanted to do something low key with him.)

He has the sweetest demeanor, and I can tell he has a heart of gold; he told me about his family, and other personal stories that were far from the small talk that both of our types dislike. He made great eye contact and at times, he kinda stared at me with this sparkle in his eye, and one time I asked, ‚Äúwhat are you thinking?‚Äù He said he was thinking that I was cute. He is just charming and sweet and genuine, from what I can tell. He seemed genuinely interested in me, and I tried to let him take most of the lead. But he is a very go with the flow guy, which is wonderful.... until it‚Äôs time for him to make decisions. (I also asked him to take the mbti before we met, he is also an enneagram 9.)

Anyway, two days later we have our second date. I had decided to drive to him and take cookies instead of having him over. We had a lovely time, driving with the windows down, laughing, teasing, and some periods of comfortable silence. I brought watercolor paints for us to paint the scenery, and he looked at me again with the sweet expression and it made my heart melt. I feel somehow so comfortable, calm, and at ease with him, and totally into him at the same time... I‚Äôve never felt quite that way about anyone before. He really is special and I‚Äôm realizing that I have a real crush on him now. 

I had kind of hinted that I like people who are good texters, in a joking sort of way, and he laughed and said that his friends have told him that he‚Äôs bad at responding to texts; he said he would try to do better at that. He also made some comments that alluded to the fact that he wanted to keep seeing me. He very sweetly asked me if he could give me a hug when I dropped him off before I went home, and he gave me a nice hug... I didn‚Äôt want to let go.

Anyway, he said that for our third date, he would plan it and that he would text me and ‚Äúlet me know.‚Äù This was almost a full week ago now. 

Four days ago, around 10pm, he texts me and says, ‚ÄúHey you. I know it's getting a bit late but I just wanted to let you know I hadn't forgotten about you. I hope you're doing well and aren't too stressed out with school over there.‚Äù I responded within 15 minutes and said that I was a little stressed, but that I was looking forward to visiting my family over the weekend and I asked him how he was doing. 

Four days later, he hasn‚Äôt responded. I feel like texting, ‚Äúdid you forget after all?‚Äù

I‚Äôve had bad experiences with so many guys leading me on, that I just am to the point where I‚Äôm already expecting to be disappointed yet again. Why would he say ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt forgotten‚Äù yet not respond? I know isfps aren‚Äôt the best planners, but if he really wanted to see me again, I‚Äôd tend to think he would have responded by now. I know I‚Äôm probably overthinking it, but I guess as a woman who‚Äôs been hurt by several ‚Äúsweet‚Äù guys, I just am jaded and don‚Äôt want this to end badly. I truly feel like he‚Äôs special and I really want to date him. However I want to have him take the lead now, since I made the effort in the beginning.

isfp,"Asking out of curiosity.

I've been talking to this potential relationship for a while now, we didn't meet in real life yet but we've had a really nice connection, and as we talked I saw that we were really similar in many ways. I was even starting to get a little bit attached...

But today they were just...off, distant and uninterested somehow. I tried asking but they just said they were reading. Then I asked if maybe they wanted to talk another time, they said it's fine, but I was the one carrying the conversation and, soon enough realizing that they really had no interest in continuing it, eventually stopped replying. And now I'm pretty sure I won't talk to them again until they initiate it themselves.

I've also been giving them excellent opportunities to say the perfect thing and show their interest, but they haven't picked it up enough times for me to realize that they're not taking the hint on purpose.

So while ISFPs have a reputation of being hopeless romantics, does that also mean they will overlook stuff like this and continue talking to them anyway, trying to ""win them over"" so to speak? Or are you guys also out as soon as you see any sign of a disinterest?",1601772649

isfp,"Me (ISFP) and Friend (INFP)

I have a friend of 7yrs who I consider my closest friend. She knows some deeply personal things about me that no one else knows (btw I hate opening up about personal things so this is important to me) and vice versa. However, this has been a very rocky friendship which I would class to be toxic (more so in the past then now). 

We had a toxic friendship for the first 3 years, didn't talk and hang out as much for the next two since I left the friendship group but reconnected for the last 3 and became so much closer. 
She is depressed and has childhood trauma which is affecting her now but she hasn't gone to see a professional about it. It started with her opening up about serious things to me which I obviously listened to which helped however it slowly became every topic we've ever had was her venting about her problems for hours. She was often sad and pretty negative about things. This lasted during those 7yrs but got much worse in the last 3.

I listen and give advice to help find a solution or a way to fix the problem since that's my way of helping people but it came to the point I couldn't handle it anymore. I became the therapy friend and had serious emotional burnout where I didn't even want to be around her anymore. I slowly started to resent her which I absolutely hated because she's going through so much. 
I have told her so many times to speak to someone professionally but for 3 yrs to now she hasn't done so despite saying she will. 

My other friends have said that I can't keep on putting her first when it's starting to affect me a lot but how can I not help her when she's going through so much. I don't know, its just frustrating to essentially be her therapist (listening to her talk for hours about her problems in every conversation we have) when she won't actually get a therapist which she can speak to for free.

A huge part of me doesn't want to be her friend anymore but I hate that I feel that way since I'm the only one she can talk to about this and its not her fault. Also, she has a fear of abandonment, that no one wants to be around her so because of this I haven't told her how I felt. If I'm not her friend anymore or I confront her about my frustrations it will affect her significantly. She's also quite impulsive and gets defensive really fast therefore I always avoid saying things which would make her angry (lowkey intimidating).

enfp female here. I have been dating a forty years old ISFP for two months. It‚Äôs been slow and steady since the beginning. Pretty consistent pace. We see each other twice a week, text regularly (I initiate 70% of the time). 
He talks about his family, his fights with his mother and how he feels about it, so that‚Äôs good sign. He‚Äôs affectionate and very present when we are together.
But there are times, where he is distant. He answers my text but with less enthusiasm. If I don‚Äôt initiate we can not text the entire day...
I guess, what worries me the most is that it evolves significantly in terms of pace.

isfp,"Hi guys! 

I'd love your perspectives on the situation I have found myself in with my new relationship but particularly over the past six months (exacerbated by Covid I'm sure). 

Issue : I find that when an issue in the relationship comes up that I find triggering (either relating to my behaviour or something of his that I take as a sign that he doesn't care for me!) then I tend to want to shut down, pull away and fantasise about ending things, and moving away like I've always wanted to! 

Reasons?: In a nutshell I have been seeing a therapist for the past 6 weeks and she has helped me to identity some narratives that have been shaping my life and relationships, I suppose fear of abandonment is the right term for it! 
My last LTR also ended to my surprise and left me very devastated, and I half worry I'm pushing my SO away preemptively so that it doesn't happen again (but trying to be conscious of these feelings and nip them in the bud). 

Question to you: Is it a distinctly ISFP response to fantastise about becoming a higher you without the person that we perceived to have slighted us, going away and metamorphosing with new experiences is what we love for right? Do you also find it hard to judge what instincts you have from either personality (or trauma, and how do you even distinguish between these?) i.e: to leave, are not beneficial.in the long run and should maybe be ignored for the harder, more 'boring' option? (Staying and working things out maturely?) How do you make these decisions yourself?

Anyway, I feel there isn't any animosity on either end (he laughed at a funny post I made on social recently) but neither of us has made a peep in two weeks.

isfp,"ISFPS can be very much like ""intuitives"". Everyone has it. They employ it differently from INFPs. They can be highly ""intuitive"", more so than INFPs

So I was watching Harry murrell.

 And INFPs use Fi-si as their ""responsibility"" if you will. I'm an INFP who has a rather weirdo imagination but the imagination is a when I'm relaxed/daydreaming (dormant state). However when INFPs must make a decision, when they are living everyday life they prefer Fi-Si. Si makes the perception of our inner state very precise/granular. That is why I can't relate to isfps as much on this part. They are very chill. Si is the way we tend to view our Fi, through a very detailed lense. We use Ne to gather different perspectives but ultimately sit down and see where it goes with si. It's also why INFPs have a bit of Stockholm syndrome since we're constantly knowing that there may be a different reason for someone behaving a certain way. While Ni is the way isfps anchor their Fi, in this kind of unclear but all encompassing lense. There are images they must make real. Their ultimate agenda is being the end character by collecting Se experiences and solidifying them. ISFPs are very future oriented.

That thing Inxps talk about sitting around daydreaming about things and imagination running wild at night, is actually Ni not Ne, those are when you relinquish responsibility.  That's why INFPs talk about sometimes having ""inwardly facing Ne"" which I used to think it was as well lmfao.

Fi-si makes INFPs analytical and more human-experience oriented with their emotions, trying to find a definition for the overall human feelings. That is why INFPs are neurotic, and constantly worrying about the ""morals"" of their emotions. Fi-Ni makes ISFPs very future oriented, chasing to see what they can be in the FUTURE. They catch glimpses of things they could be, which with their Se they go and try out. They collect experiences, analyse people to find a future version of themselves. Their Se is to concretize their goal. That is why ISFPs are so often people like David Bowie and Mikey Jackson, highly holistic performers who have this unforgettable persona. 

Furthermore Harry murrel (look him up) realises that the entire thing is in this spectrum. Such as Ne can turn into Se by locking into something specific and vice versa. No one is 100% either.",1601583122

isfp,"Hi all!

I reciently finished Life is Strange 2. And can't stop thinking (feeling) about it.  
I felt an inmense conection with the main character, and characters of the story, and could relate to his emotional state althrought the entire game.

And this got me thinking how much I enjoy this kind of videogames. I'd still enjoy lots of different kinds, strategy, building, adventure, metroidvania, I even played MOBA at some point (and then decided to quit every game that didn't have an ""ending"", for my own sake, but that's for another post).

But the games that still stay with me are the emotional ones, consequence based or story driven, when I can experience things with the character and somehow grow and reflect on life.

Games like:  
Life is strange 1 (obviously)  
Firewatch (keeps appearing on my mind so often, the art, the colours, that ending!)  
Oxenfree  
The Reminds of Edith Finch  
The Vanishing of Ethan Carter  
and now Life is strange 2, wich I know I'd be thinking for a while now.

I'm waiting for Campo Santo new game ""In the valley of Gods"", after the success of Firewatch, and later, when I can emotionally ""heal"" from LiS2 I might start ""Tell me Why"".

Imaginng myself in those situations, and really emphatizing with the characters, almost as we were the same person. I know they are suppoused to be designed that way ('empty' vassels for the player/spectator to project) and they do the job really well, at least to me.

I don't know.. I feel like I kinda needed to talk about this.  
I kinda had this feelings about fictional characters when I was young, I remember some movies touching me this way and always leaving me with a sensation of 'posibilities' and what ifs. The bittersweetness of choices and life, something's gained, something's lost. A sense of being unable to really go back to the first state of things, the nostalgia of knowing that the journey was somehow worth it, despite it's huge costs. And only the believe that the future still holds some kind of hope.

All this experiences always leave me with the sensation of wanting to do something with my life, something more, experiencing more, connecting more, creating more, sharing more, being less afraid of the world around me, of the consequences, of everything.

I'll still need time to process the emotional journey I've experienced.",1601560065

isfp,"Hi all, I am an ISFP and identify with the terms, Highly Sensitive Person (HSP) and Empath, so I hope to hear the experiences/stories of similar liked-minded individuals on discovering being an Empath...  
When I first learned about this new-age concept of Empath, I didn't think much of it. Actually, I was convinced it was hogwash. A bunch of 'woo-woo' hogwash to feed our Special-Snowflake-Syndrome modern society....but when I got deeper into the meaning of an Empath, the puzzle pieces were coming into a full portrait of myself...  
It was hard for me to accept that I am Empath. I hated my¬†sensitivity, spent running away emotions and feelings my whole life. I just didn't know how to cope with emotions and feelings...I felt assaulted by the abundance¬†of energy in all direction and became a hermit. Solitude was my haven...but that is of a lonely life for us..¬†¬†

&amp;#x200B;

Being a HSP, I couldn‚Äôt turn to conventional escapism/self-medication, such as alcohol, to numb myself and escape from my pain. I felt the affects of it right away, too deeply..it traumatized my sensory nervous system... almost if my body would not allow me to abuse myself in such a way (in reflection, seems like my essence has other plans for me..)¬†Instead,¬†my poison was dissociation.¬†I could have undiagnosed maladaptive daydreaming disorder...

  
I was hell-bent on trying to shove a square peg into the round hole. I forget why it was so important for me to fit in that shiny box (..as one would says, 'all that glitters is not gold')...the more desperate that I was trying to run away from myself, the more trapped I had felt within myself....I wasn't ready to confront myself or to accept the responsibility that comes with the gift of being an Empath...my core wounds and potential scared and overwhelmed me...running was in my nature.

  
Now, I am in my early thirties (probably developing my terit-Ni). Weary of running and hiding from myself. Learning to do the necessary Soul work that would set me free, so I could fully heals my wounds and harness my potential in hopes of fulfilling my life mission.¬†  
Thanks for listening to my story.¬†  
P.s. If you are an open-minded, spiritual individual (doesn't matter your MBTI) and would be interested in connecting with me for guidance and healing pathways, please reach out to me via PM! I would love to have talks with you on spirituality among other philosophical 'big life questions' topics.¬†",1601425952

I keep telling him that she's not going to change her behavior and that she'll always be bad for him no matter what he does.

I sell and buy clothes almost every week (less recently since I'm trying to budget) so I have new clothes to wear all the time. I change my style frequently too.

I just get bored easily and love to try/have new, different things. It excites me. Are you guys like this too?",1601042753

This man clearly does not fuck with ISFP‚Äôs and he‚Äôs trying so hard to hide it. But he rarely has anything good to say while typecasting/social engineering is.. even having referred to us as the most useless type.

This is exactly what some people mean by intuitive bias. Intuitives try very hard to convince themselves that they are most important and look to key figures as a form of validation. But some of these figures are made up fictional characters or even deceased. I think it‚Äôs a kind of crazy making.

He even made a point to call us lazy and unsuccessful while ignoring that a vast majority of celebrities are ISFP‚Äôs! Including one of the worlds richest musicians. Tbh, it sounds like pure jealousy. As he went out of his way to say that he thinks INFP‚Äôs are the most brilliant type with more potential than anyone else. Statistically, that is not accurate. 

This guy seems to have difficulty controlling his biases and seems to be trying to build intuitives up and break sensors down as some kind of power trip or something. It‚Äôs getting really difficult for me to want to learn more about my mbti type because of how much bias is taking place in the community. I honestly think I learn more about myself through friends and through people in my everyday life because atleast I can rely on them to give direct and honest feedback without any hidden motives",1600948039

isfp,"This will be a rant/long story, so if you don't like those, turn away now. (I highly recommend it)

I blocked my INTP friend of 5 years, because of one choice he made.

Too long, didn't read at the bottom.

1. Background:

5 years ago, Autumn of 2015. I started playing a game called Growtopia, and when i stumbled upon a scam world, i met this one guy in there. There were multiple people, but he stood out from all of them. So i add him and that's where it all begins.

I didn't talk to him alot, atleast not as much as before i blocked him, because only contact i could make was through the game. He was active for a few months, until he disappears from the game. In early-mid 2016.

Emotional distress:

2016 was a hard year for me. I had to move to a new town, after unfortunate events and a new school was ahead, so i thought. It's all going to be great. Well, it wasn't. People in the new school were, quite different compared to the previous, even though the school size was almost the same (around fifty students.) It was manageable for me, but the next year was going to get even worse.

Secondary school:

The first day of secondary school was, something else that i had not experienced before. The people were now, alot different than in the 6th grade. And as the 7th grade progressed, it got even worse. I'm not one to self-diagnose, but i'm quite sure i had some sort of winter depression in 7th and 8th grade. It was not going well for me. What made it even worse, were my classmates, who teased me regularly. It was not fun. 9th grade was fine, i have recovered okay-ishly and i'm very glad i got out of secondary school. So how does this translate to the story i'm going to tell you? Let's find out.

2. New signs of my friends presence:

So i had visited the game in 2017 after i quit in 2016. I hadn't met my friend in ages, but now i was at the verge of meeting him. It was either 2017 or 2018 and it was summer time. My friend was being online more and more. I had seen him online a few times, but i didn't know how to meet him after 2 years, so i tried to think of something, but he always left for weeks or months. It would still take another year for me to find him.

2019 the reunion:

I don't want to talk happily about this, but i will, since that was my mindset at that time.

It was autumn of 2019, school had started. I met a new friend in Growtopia and i chatted with her. That initially kept me playing for the time passing. One day i came online and i find out my INTP friend is online, i go to meet him and i don't think he recognized me at first, but i recognized him and we started chatting. I was quite surprised and happy that he was online. I still thought he was the same after those 3 years, but i was wrong and i was making a mistake.

Getting to know each other:

We never made it personal before. It was always just some stories or some stuff related to the game or what was relevant at that time. The mistake i was making, was that i made our friendship personal. It was fine in the game, but i started to make it more personal.

We had played for months now, i felt like we should get to each other, because why not? In the game our conversation had been very vague about ourselves, so i asked where we should chat and he said the Xbox app. I created an account and we started to chat.

The first thing i noticed was that he began using reaction images to respond. It was fine for me, but it was really weird for me. We chatted alot during the lockdown in spring of 2020 and we progressed, getting to know each other.

He starts to become obnoxious:

So first thing you need to know. Is that my friend is an INTP, very narcissistic, considers himself to be a sociopath. Pretty much all self-diagnosed, but he wasn't like this all the time. 

Spring is ending and summer of 2020 is beginning, so i was happy, because summer is my favorite season. My friend started to turn into a pessimistic and narcissist. He began to pick at every little thing. The mistake, of making our conversation personal started to backfire. He started to disrespect me and my opinions. He claimed to be genuine, but he said i was stupid, because i didn't agree to his opinions. He always whined back and made excuses or tried to hide a truth i told to him. We had arguments, that really started to spark the heat between us. He claimed he won an 'argument', when all i wanted to do is have fun and tell an opinion i had on afterlife. He started to pick every little thing and made it an argument himself. It's what pissed me off.

He started to make jokes off of my past like 6th and 7th/8th grade and other things. The worst thing is that he thought he had gone through more emotional distress, but i don't think he did. He didn't even feel remorse.

I start to understand... for a while:

So, he started the whole INTP thing and he sent me some memes. I didn't know what it was about so i asked him and he told me what myers briggs test is. I did it myself and got ISFP. I have always been empathetic and understanding, i have alot of remorse, but my friend wasn't the same.

1-2 months ago, my INTP friend comes to me and claims he has Sociopathy, i was quite joking at first, because he joked about lots of things i messaged. He says that he has the lack of empathy.

It was nothing promising to me, since he had changed alot and i didn't care, but i started to realise, why his actions might relate to lack of empathy. I tried to understand him, but he always joked and he used the lack of empathy as his excuse. I should have left him earlier.

3. Breaking point:

I had been a friend of his in the internet for years, and we knew alot about each other. The breaking point was when he claimed his dog died. Now, before we get into it, he had talked about saying that he wants people to feel sorry for him, which was apparently his manipulation method. So, back to it, i asked that: ""is this the moment where you want me to feel sorry for you?"", but he kept on going. I first doubted, but then i took it seriously. He went on going about how his pet bird died and he feels sad. Me being the empathetic person, i started to feel him. I started to relate my dead pet to his dead dog, and he went very personal and said that: ""your family must have gone through rough stuff since your family has experienced lots of losses."" And i took it personally. I started to relate my dead family member to his conversation, and how it feels to lose someone and what is the aftermath. I got very emotional and he said: ""We can go back to normal conversation"" and he asked me: ""Do you think i was being serious?"" I said that: ""Yes, i believe you were serious about your conversation."" He said that: ""I was not."" And put a mocking emote there. I just stood there. I didn't believe it, this was the last straw. I first removed all the chats, he sent: ""Hello?"" And i blocked him. It didnt feel much, but Eleony. If you see this, fuck you.

TL;DR: I removed a long time INTP friend after he made a very personal conversation fake.",1600886020

But in reality, I am super clear about my intentions from the very beginning and very very slow to commit. I live day by day, so when people come into my life.. go on maybe 3 dates and then start making all of these plans for the future, I get sooooo turned off. 

I do not want marriage and kids as I grew up as the eldest child and spent most of my childhood taking care of my brother and father when my mom wasn‚Äôt around. I quickly realized that this wasn‚Äôt the life from me and chose a path of freedom and independence instead.

When I date, this is one of the very first things I share with people because I know that it will be a problem if I don‚Äôt. Most of the guys I date claim they understand. We have fun for a couple of weeks/months then out of nowhere they drop the ‚ÄúI know you said you want to take it slow, but I want a future with you. I have so many plans for us.‚Äù 

It turns me off so bad because I‚Äôm the beginning, they always respond to my boundaries by saying ‚Äúno problem, you sound great.‚Äù This guy I‚Äôm dating is upset with me because I went cold with him after repeatedly having him bring up marriage and future plans when I‚Äôve asked him not to. Now he is being all petty and vengeful because I‚Äôve distanced myself (he‚Äôs an enfj).

However as supposed feeler type, they never bring up discussion about their emotions but rather it is me talking about it all the time?? 

I considered the chance of me typing them wrong, but they don‚Äôt tend to recognize patterns  of things neither talk with logic as much as I do, thus they are not Ti or Te dom/parent. They are apparently rich in moral values and deep feelings, and pretty much live in the present thus they are not intuitives.

I‚Äôm so confused. Are they just closing themselves up from me?? Or could I be the one who‚Äôs having problems? It‚Äôs really hard because they can‚Äôt express even when there‚Äôs a solid need of emotional clarity/reality check to dispel misunderstandings.

isfp,"Hey guys ü•∫

So I met this guy and he‚Äôs the sweetest. Of course I had to ask him for his mbti and he said in the multiple tests he‚Äôs taken he‚Äôs been either isfp or infp. I‚Äôm an isfp myself and half my family are infps but so far he doesn‚Äôt seem like either? But that‚Äôs not the point. 

So we‚Äôve been talking throughout the day everyday, having sexy time fun, singing and laughing with each other, going on mini adventures, etc. and he‚Äôs just an all around amazing guy! BUT he does this thing that‚Äôs really starting to annoy me where I‚Äôm trying to be silly or make a joke, and he‚Äôll understand that it‚Äôs a joke but it‚Äôs always followed by a long explanation or him justifying the fun?

For example the other day I drew a beard on my face with eyeliner and snapchatted him and he thought it was funny but then he went on to explain that he liked me just the way I am and that he would prefer no beard. So I joked again and erased the beard and used my hair to make a moustache and jokingly said ‚Äúso a moustache is okay then? üòú‚Äù and then he sent me another message saying ‚Äúno I like you just the way you are‚Äù then rambled on about how if I wanted to be silly then sure I could do that! But I‚Äôm general he would prefer that I didn‚Äôt have a moustache because he likes me just as I am but FOR SURE if I wanted to be silly I could have a moustache (I‚Äôm a girl btw, and I can‚Äôt physically grow one)

And then he continues by saying how there‚Äôs absolutely nothing wrong with being silly and having fun! And that if I wanted to do that we absolutely could because why not? And being silly is fun and good sometimes! Isn‚Äôt it the goal to have fun with each other? 

And I know these things, I‚Äôm not saying there‚Äôs anything wrong with being silly or having fun. (I‚ÄôM LITERALLY TRYING TO DO THAT NOW WITH THE BEARD AND MOUSTACHE SNAPCHATS) 

Or I‚Äôll tell him a random fact about me like how I prefer tea over coffee and he‚Äôll say ‚Äúthere‚Äôs nothing wrong with that‚Äù 
And yes once or twice it‚Äôs fine to say those things but it‚Äôs happening basically every time I say something like that. Like yes I KNOW there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that or liking homework, or being early to an event or being a dog person. I don‚Äôt need justification for it?? 
And whenever he tells me things he feels the need to justify everything as well!

I‚Äôve brought it up before but that just resulted in a justification of his justifications ü•∫
Which was basically ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs how I am and I just like being extra clear‚Äù but that was a full 2 minute explanation. 

What I‚Äôm trying to say is: does anyone know how I should approach this? I know it‚Äôs really not that big of a problem but it‚Äôs really starting to get on my nerves and be a downer when I just want to have fun.",1600825862

    i dont really think im a feeler because im not really into emotional stuff. like i dont care for feelings. im good at handling others emotions but not my own. sometimes I even wonder, why does the world value emotions so much? why does it matter?
    im also pretty intuitive, i daydream all the time and put a lot of energy into abstract things. but i dont think thats a problem because isfps are considered the most intuitive sensors.

isfp,"We‚Äôre often working extremely hard and trying to find balance across the various realms of our lives. I‚Äôm guilty of this too. This was when I came across The Four Burners Theory which essentially breaks your life into 4 quadrants:

1. Family
2. Friends
3. Health
4. Work

The principle behind this theory is that in order to be truly successful in any of these areas, the intensity of one of these burners needs to be turned down. This sounds like a crappy deal, but the truth is that life is full of tradeoffs and embracing that is the first step to thriving.

There are seasons where some of these burners will thrive more than other and I, personally, choose to make temporary compromises in order to truly give myself to truly succeed at one thing. There are a few ways that I‚Äôve learnt to make the best of finding harmony between my work and the rest of my life including embracing limitations and incorporating seasonality.

This has always been a really interesting concept to me and I dive deep into it here - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khaWb5XqZNM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khaWb5XqZNM) . Hope this helps give you a better idea of how to approach chasing ‚Äúbalance‚Äù in your life.",1600532286
isfp,"For context, I wasn‚Äôt really into the whole personality type stuff until my twin brother (who is INTP) typed me and told me I am ISFP. And by the way he was explaining it, I‚Äôm pretty damn sure I am an ISFP. I have a strong sense of who I am, I hate being in situations where I‚Äôm forced to be different or I‚Äôm out of my element, and I care a lot about what others think (as much as that pains me to admit lol). When I have to be extroverted (which many people think I am a lot of time), I tend to express myself through movements and expressions, or being funny and making jokes. 

However, there are times where I‚Äôll think to myself and wonder if maybe I‚Äôm not really an ISFP? Like I can‚Äôt be the same personality type as Michael Jackson, Jimi Hendrix, and all these legends lol. Maybe it‚Äôs just my self doubt speaking?",1600502547

isfp,"Hi,
I‚Äòm dating an ISFP for a while now and there is something that worries me: his general lack of empathy for people, and that he avoids negative feelings at all costs. 
He told me that he doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúfeel‚Äù, he doesn‚Äôt understand people who are in struggle. A friend of his confided him in about his suicidal thoughts, and my boyfriend literally ran away, being overwhelmed but also mad that he got dragged into this situation in the first place. 
He also couldn‚Äôt grieve when a loved one died. He felt ‚Äúnothing‚Äù, even though he knew he was supposed to feel something.
He is a very sensible person, so I assume this is the way he tries to protect himself, however, this sounds really, really unhealthy.
Has any ISFP ever dealt with this before? How can I help him?",1600473108

isfp,"I know you won‚Äôt come anytime soon. You‚Äôre probably busy chasing your dreams, the possibilities ahead and somewhere else, and I‚Äôm just a speck of a chance in your far periphery now. 

But since you are my future beloved, you have no choice. It‚Äôs already written. Fate will always favor me. It will drag you to me in all awful ways just to be closer. 

You will lose a job at some point. You will get rejected by the woman you‚Äôre dying to get. Oh those women. And maybe more. You will experience more. You will be bored and feel lonely and empty that one day you will decide to go somewhere fresh and new, a place where nobody knows you. 

No, I won‚Äôt magically appear at the airport. I‚Äôm not that desperate. No, I am not going to be those who welcome you to varieties of delights in the place. No, I won‚Äôt be the one sitting across you in cafes, or those who wonder why you‚Äôre here. Because I already know anyway‚Äî in this story, I‚Äôm not dumb! 

There are two places for sure where we‚Äôre going to cross our paths. One of which is the supermarket. Or cash machine. I hope it‚Äôs not going to be at the boring cash machines. 

I often get in many situations where the person lining in front up of me at the supermarket cashier is someone I instantly fall in love with. Sometimes it‚Äôs the way they hold Nutella or their favorite cookies. Never once I had the courage to look closely or longer. It‚Äôs embarrassing to be touched that way in such public proximity. 

If ever it‚Äôll be you, please don‚Äôt say ‚ÄúYou go first‚Äù. Imagine you are going to be a mute and you only have 2 sentences left to say, and it happens in that moment you look back and see me feverish, helpless on my groceries and shy‚Äî it course I‚Äôm good at acting‚Äî what‚Äôs the perfect line you could say? 

Well, since I‚Äôm told you‚Äôre a bit of a moron, I‚Äôll suggest this anyway, ‚ÄúExcuse me, can I help?‚Äù That‚Äôs easy to memorize. In that moment, I will forget that I‚Äôm a strong independent woman, and will not secondguess lying it in your face: ‚ÄúYes‚Äù. Clear and quick. I will then give my best 10-thousand megawatt smile, walk proudly along with you into the exit door, and before you ask if I‚Äôll take a transport, there I‚Äôd be shameless and say, ‚ÄúWould you like to take me on a date? I think you should‚Äù. 

No one has ever done that courage in history. Of course, because you‚Äôre my future beloved, you‚Äôd say ‚ÄúYes‚Äù and tell me your name.",1600452421
isfp,"
Recently noticed that one of my friends struggled so much in life because they kept applying others' standards to themself and coming to the conclusion that they weren't ""good enough"" and that's why people left them. Sorta a whole existential crisis thing almost. They were looking for meaning in their life, but they were searching for it on other people but not themself. 

Thing is, they feel emotions very deeply and few can see those moments. They often need to process things on their own for a while. Sometimes something comes up, especially in regards to their identity, and they will feel extremely hurt but at the same time call it unreasonable, stating they don't know why. 

Perhaps they're in a shadow and the reason they're so unhappy is because they haven't listened to their Fi at all? They usually type as ISFP on tests and I know for certain they're on the Se-Ni axis. Maybe they're a Ti user in reality? I doubt that. But I also think that Fi users would be more...proud? Of who they are and who they wanna be, mostly disregarding others' criticism.

I'm trying to see how this works with the four sides of the mind theory, but I need some input from you guys. Has anyone experienced anything similar?",1600437324

isfp,"I always get isfp on the test and I fit a lot of the description. I used to think I was infp but I am isfp.
I love caregiving and loved my job at a senior living home as a teen. I don‚Äôt see my self as artistic at all. I see myself as the least artistic person ever. I also feel like I could be spontaneous but I feel like I can be lazy and want to learn to change. I do like adventure and nature but never really do these things. I don‚Äôt know what I should major in or what career to choose. I was looking at careers online and I don‚Äôt see myself as being a fashion designer because that sounds impossible to achieve. 

I have seen posts online that Hannah Godwin from the bachelor is an isfp. I guess she works in fashion as an influencer and went on a show. I see myself wanting to do a career like that but also see myself wanting to work in nursing or in a hospital. I feel like many of the influencers have great asthetic and style &amp; that‚Äôs a part of isfp. I have been told I dress cute/well often but it‚Äôs not individual. Plus, I like every style and can‚Äôt choose my own- but I‚Äôm also only into ‚Äúbasic‚Äù styles so Idk if that‚Äôs not isfp. When I see girls wearing more preppy east coast style, west coast style, online boutiques.. idk I just like every style of clothes and don‚Äôt have individuality. 

I was diagnosed with  adhd recently because I really enjoy learning but couldn‚Äôt focus at all so they put me on adderall. I feel like adderall may take some of the fun side of my personality away",1600385508

isfp,"So upon doing my own function stack, and spending months thinking about this and being frustrated,
I got ISFP, as an adult I‚Äôm pretty outgoing so it would have been a hard guess with a outside perspective, tapping into my childhood and breaking my functions down helped but took some soul searching.
So for a fun little experiment, what do you think?
I‚Äôve been told ISFP (and this is what I stacked myself as) and INFP. 

Type Me

‚Ä¢ How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself? 


I‚Äôm 25, female from America. I grew up with separated parents from the get go. I was an only child who switched schools and moved a lot, I was always exceptionally smart and excelled at anything I found interesting (English, history, art class) but anything I didn‚Äôt like (Math &amp; P.E.) I would put 0 effort into.
I‚Äôve always struggled with organizing and simple processes that organized people are good at,
Putting shoes on shelf, toys back after your done playing ect. My parents would make me clean my room and I would sit in my room for like 5-8 hours not cleaning because I didn‚Äôt want too and drove my parents insane. I was stubborn with things I didn‚Äôt want to do beyond words, no bribe was good enough if I didn‚Äôt want too. Though most people probably wouldn‚Äôt have used stubborn to describe me, I was pretty easy going, go with the flow, don‚Äôt enjoy conflict and known to walk on eggshells, but for some reason the few things I chose to be stubborn on were 100%. I didn‚Äôt have a lot of friends growing up, I had 1-2 here and there but since I moved a lot, bonds were hard to form. I was very good at playing by myself, I played bored games as both people and remember challenging myself to make unbiased game moves against myself, I was very independent and always had a very good understanding of what was going on around me, often referred to as a ‚Äúlittle adult‚Äù with how I spoke and acted around adults. I had a very good understanding of lying at a young age and how you can lie to make situations better or conceal how shitty things really are. My moms was very unstable and my life was chaotic and I knew I had to lie at school so no red flags were raised. I made up a story to CPS that my mom was just really into being eco friendly and not using resources that negatively impact the environment and then just tried to tell him about composting to stop talking about my mom when I was like 9.. because our power had been off for like 6 months. 
Anywho, I think I should answer these other questions but that‚Äôs my nutshell ü•ú 


‚Ä¢ Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?
Adhd inattentive 

‚Ä¢ Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?

I was born into a Jewish family but my mom was essentially the black sheep who didn‚Äôt keep up tradition or teach me much, holidays and seeing extended family were where I had all my culture and tradition from since she chose her own path with addiction and dysfunction so I didn‚Äôt exactly grow up like my cousins, and I don‚Äôt currently practice any religion but still keep up some traditions from my childhood alive without the religious backing. 

‚Ä¢ What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?
I‚Äôm a waitress, it‚Äôs okay.
It‚Äôs not where I want to be but for now it pays my bills and lets me keep up with my hobbies.
Good money for the amount or time I have to work which is ideal. 

‚Ä¢ If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?
depends on when you ask me, on average I tend to love 1 on 1, though I often feel like I spend to much time hanging out and neglect doing things I love that I can only do by myself.
I‚Äôm really shy about things I put my heart into artistically, I don‚Äôt show people my writing, my paintings or anything I actually have to pull from emotion to create. I‚Äôm crafty and will show off my little superficial crafts to friends that are fun and silly but never anything that takes real soul searching and emotion.  So for that I can‚Äôt have people around so sometimes if I havnt had enough time for that, then I‚Äôd be fine being alone. Most of the time I like having 1 friend over at my house that I hate leaving but I‚Äôm not l a fan of being in a group though do oblige since my friends are very important to me and if it‚Äôs important I‚Äôm there for them, then it‚Äôs important that I‚Äôm there. 

‚Ä¢ What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?

I danced ballet and that was my main hobby athletically as a kid.
I did track for a little while and enjoyed it, I hurdled.

‚Ä¢ How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please explain? 

Im very curious. My brain is constantly asking questions and seeking answers. I‚Äôm really nosey, but an great secret keeper. My motivation to not divulge gossip and tell secrets comes down to 
1) if i tell someone and they find out, then I will no longer be told secrets and I like knowing what‚Äôs going on  around me and being up to date and the current situation behind closed doors.
2) the conflict coming from telling a secret and being caught is too much, I hate drama and conflict if I‚Äôm involved. I only like living vicariously through other people‚Äôs drama.

‚Ä¢ Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?

I‚Äôm highly competitive, becoming some sort of leader is a prize. Sometimes I get caught in this rut but I have 0 interest in being a boss and having that much responsibility and having that many people to be responsible for. I‚Äôm awful at conflict, I don‚Äôt wanna fire people. I literally loop myself into this sometimes, I turned down the manager position at my last job after basically securing it through all my extra roles I took on and making myself privy on management duties and processes and a perfect easy train to be manager. 
 
‚Ä¢ Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?
I have average coordination,
I danced so obviously that helped,
I was not a naturally coordinated child by any means. 
I do enjoy working with my hands, I tend to be a pretty hands on learner, I never read directions before putting things together until I‚Äôve tried to do it by looking at it first, then I‚Äôll stagger through the directions when I get lost. 

‚Ä¢ Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particularly artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forms of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.

I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm exceptionally gifted when it comes to all forms of art, but I love art.
I have a plethora of crafts and projects to always give me an outlet. I watercolor, sew, knit, I love my bullet journal, I think I‚Äôm a phenomenal writer when I‚Äôm in the right headspace but unfortunately it‚Äôs hard to get there. My personal aesthetic is important to me, I express myself through clothes, makeup, hair ect.
I‚Äôll search far and wide for a perfect hair clip to compliment my outfit and pull together the mood. Things most wont notice, but for me it completes it.
Even with such minuscule things as placing proper lingerie under dresses when going out can often be pulled into the aesthetic when I know nobody will see it, but for me it matters that it‚Äôs all balanced and tied together and no detail should be spared.
Obviously I have lazy days but more often than not, Im all put together. For me clothes and appearance are a form of art as weird as that sounds. 

‚Ä¢ What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?

Past: My past is often searched through when I need it, I look back and thing about how it effects my present. I don‚Äôt particularly dwell on it, ‚Äúis what it is‚Äù kind of situation 

Present: I‚Äôm impulsive AF and live in the moment more than I lead on. The Future is fucking scary 

Future: hopeful maybe I‚Äôll get my shit together but no plans on how to do that yet. 

‚Ä¢ How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?
I‚Äôm happy to help if it doesn‚Äôt majorly inconvenience me. I live for small favors,
I‚Äôm happy to grab coffee, babysit, borrow small amount of money ($10-30 to cover lunch ect), pet sit, give rides home ect though I probably will never offer to drive you to the airport at 5 am or help you move unless I really love you. 

‚Ä¢ Do you need logical consistency in your life?
I suppose not,
I believe in some things that simply can‚Äôt be proven though few and far between.
I tend to stick to facts and evidence when making opinions about things. 

‚Ä¢ How important is efficiency and productivity to you?
I wish I was more efficient and productive.
I have a great brain but I can be really unmotivated and often procrastinate  

‚Ä¢ Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?
I hate this question,
Yes I‚Äôm very good at controlling certain personalities for my gain  though I reserve that skill for good.
I can often manipulate a situation to have a good outcome when it‚Äôs headed south. I don‚Äôt ever use this skill for anything malicious. More or less unpredictable people as a survival technique to avoid escalation.

‚Ä¢ What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?
Anything I can create, I love making things. 
Painting pictures, making a quilt, making candles, photography. I collect hobbies and constantly try new things surrounding crafts and arts. I like reading books, watching movies and listening to music, I love to sing though I‚Äôm not very good it‚Äôs still something I love doing while driving or alone. 

‚Ä¢ What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?

Memory and creativity are my strongest skills, though memory can be iffy as I tend to have to actually be interested to choose to store it in my brain (math never stuck idk) I remember things in images and little memory videos, text book pages of where I read the answer, images of where I last had my phone because I looked at it when I set it down, image or the word spelled to remember how to spell it ect 

‚Ä¢ How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?

wing it as I go 100% 

‚Ä¢ What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?

To be normal and do things I love.
I want stability, I want to be organized, I want a decent paying career that makes me happy and isn‚Äôt boring, I want a nice middle class home and reliable cars, to be able to afford experiences such as traveling or going to concerts, musicals ect. I want to be able to afford to make my life aesthetically pleasing 


‚Ä¢ What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?

I hate conflict, I just shutdown and it‚Äôs the worst feeling ever. I avoid it like the plague. I‚Äôm afraid of unpredictable people, I don‚Äôt like unexpected behaviors and fear they will become dangerous.
I‚Äôm afraid of getting in trouble,
I follow laws and don‚Äôt rock boats. 
Talking about my feelings makes me uncomfortable, usually I just make jokes to make light or feelings.
I have a lot of feelings though.
I‚Äôm often torn between 
1) showing emotion gives somebody an in to your weaknesses and what breaks you down, essentially showing your hand
2) I feel like my feelings are insane sometimes and it‚Äôs like a Pandora‚Äôs box of bullshit that would be exhausting to explain and hard to follow or understand  anyways so it‚Äôs not worth the divulge 
I‚Äôm not a robot though, I do divulge feelings on surface level though and when I find somebody who understands and makes me feel comfortable, askes the right questions and digs with the trust established, then I can unload and sometimes can just sorta overwhelm them with the things I can‚Äôt talk to anybody else about and then I just feel stupid because I‚Äôm pretty sure they think I‚Äôm insane cause I word vomited 25 years of feelings and then I‚Äôll usually reel it in and try to not do that again, but if they continue their comforting inquisitive tactics, I can keep going through that cycle. 

‚Ä¢ What do the ""highs"" in your life look like?

People think I‚Äôm a good person so that‚Äôs pretty cool, I like that people choose to associate me with the good I try to spread. I‚Äôm proud of that. 

I‚Äôm a great mom, I know most people wonder if they‚Äôre doing okay, I know I am because that‚Äôs the only option I‚Äôve given myself. Raising these humans is such a huge importance in my life , a huge high in my life and I‚Äôm proud of who they‚Äôre becoming and I love seeing my influence come out when they talk, they speak so kind and positive and it makes me really proud that the way I‚Äôve chosen to guide and influence them really was a good choice and has played out nicely. Many people warned me my way would only create selfish brats, but they‚Äôre kind, empathetic and giving little humans.



‚Ä¢ What do the ""lows"" in your life look like?

Some days I‚Äôm so exhausted and do nothing all day,
I have days where I sit on my couch all day with my girls and we just watch movies cause I‚Äôm literally so mentally drained. Usually after a long week at work. 

‚Ä¢ How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?
I daydream but I‚Äôm often aware of my surroundings.
Not being aware of my surroundings is danger to my brain.  I tend daydream most when I‚Äôm creating and use them as inspiration to build off.

‚Ä¢ Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?

It would depend on what was going on in my life, 
I tend to pull daydreams from what I wish my life was like. Could be what if I was born a princess , could be romanticizing a date with the cute boy I saw in the grocery store for 2.5 seconds, could be how long I would survive on Naked and afraid could be a plethora of things, my brains pretty whimsical when left to its own thought process. 

‚Ä¢ How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?

Can be fast, can be til the last minute depending on how passionate I feel.
I chose my children‚Äôs names months before their arrival but about a month after starting the naming process. Both of them have the same names I decided on when I made my final decision and starting telling people the name.  
I almost never change my mind once I‚Äôve made and verbalized a decision
 
‚Ä¢ How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?

It‚Äôs a pretty quick process I call ‚Äúdon‚Äôt think about it‚Äù
You just keep shoving them down you until they don‚Äôt fit anymore and then you have a little emotional meltdown and you‚Äôre good for awhile. I tend to have this process behind closed doors. 

‚Ä¢ Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?

I don‚Äôt necessarily agree with people arbitrarily, but I will listen to them without putting my 2 cents in for the sake of conflict avoidance.
I tend to not say things I don‚Äôt mean, it‚Äôs uncomfortable for me.

‚Ä¢ Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?
 I break rules that have bend and have some sort of grey area with low risk associated.
We‚Äôre not allowed to wear colored hair accessories only black, I wear whatever accessories I want because nobody cares  and it‚Äôs been tested and proven that no push back will come from me not following a dumb formality; I enjoy pushing my dress code to the limit any place ive ever worked even its just by adding a perfect little hair clip or headband that doesn‚Äôt effect anything but gives me a little creative freedom. 


If you‚Äôre reading this, thank you!
You made it through me really long post and that took me way to long to type. 
Looking forward to hearing outside feedback on my type.",1600363773
isfp,"Hello. So my boyfriend is an ISFP and he is going through a difficult time. I don't know how to help him. He is really stressed about life and school in general. The lockdown and Covid-19 certainly create more disappointment and stress for him. 

We were in a long-distance relationship and finally we were back in the same city. But, due to stress, he doesn't really want to see me or answer my text. I try to give him more alone time. However, things got worse last week and he sent me a text that sounds like he want to break up with me. His reason being he has a lot of personal problems and do not want to waste my time again. I replied to him that I am fine with that and I want to supportive. I really want to discuss with him that he should not just distance himself. Since I need to leave the town very soon, I really want to have a conversation with him but I am afraid he would avoid me.

What should I do? Any advice&gt;",1600355102
isfp,"I met an ISFP and he is very confusing to say the least lol.

Texting him for the first time, he took an hour or 2 to respond to every message (no biggie, I do the same sometimes) and as time goes by, after a few times of hanging out, it's taking 7-15+ hours for a response.

Half of me thinks he doesn't like me, and the other half does because he'll call me things like ""babe"" and what not and he never leaves me on read. Always responds, just takes foreverrrr.

First date, we were suppose to see each other around 4 and he took so long to respond, I ended up seeing him at 8. This happened EVERY time except it only got worse.

2nd planned date, he completely flagged on me. He didn't open my messages until 16 hours later, saying his ""phone flew out the window when he hit a speed bump and fell into a river"" (obviously a lie) and he expected me to believe that. After asking him so many times, he came clean and said he was just ""with the boys that night"" but why not just tell me?? And why make plans with me if he was busy? 

He won't let me follow him on Instagram (it's private) even though I let him follow me so it makes me think he has something to hide. I also caught him in a lie saying he was at work when he wasn't. 

His best friend tells me he really likes me but it really doesn't show. I haven't gotten mad at him for anything he's done in the past because I'm just easy going I guess. But I do get sad and worried I'm just wasting my time. 

If this was anybody else, I would've been done talking to him by now due to the lying. But I really do see a lot of potential in him, his personality is great and it meshes well with mine when it comes to conversation. (I'm an ENFP btw) 

I know ISFPs need their space and time alone which I completely understand. I also don't wanna be harsh with him or even call him out for all of this because I don't want to upset him. 

He likes that I'm easy going when he cancels plans and he likes how I don't get mad easily. BUT I left for a 3 week trip and asked if I could say bye to him real quick and he didn't respond until I already left the next morning. He then messaged me saying ""have a good trip, be safe ‚ù§Ô∏è"" as if nothing happened.

isfp,"I feel this has probably been addressed before, but if not...

I knew an ENFJ a few years ago. He and I really hit it off, but a number of unusual circumstances came up which meant we parted ways on bad terms. We eventually rectified things, but he wasn‚Äôt willing to give things a shot. He gave me one excuse or another but I think if he‚Äôd really wanted to he‚Äôd have given things a chance. I feel like as a coping strategy he painted a picture of me that wasn‚Äôt true, and even though I tried to correct it, it was too late.

It‚Äôs been really hard because I felt a strong connection with him and while he‚Äôs moved on I‚Äôve not. He‚Äôs made it clear there‚Äôs zero hope. I am struggling to feel like there could be anyone else who I could feel such a strong connection with as our similarities were so unique. 

My question is if you‚Äôve ever lost someone you felt you had a strong connection with, and how you eventually learned to let go and feel content in you current circumstances. Admittedly I‚Äôm also bored with my work and lack drive now, and I‚Äôm feeling distant from loved ones.

isfp,"So I've done the quizes a few times and I've gotten the following results below ISFP-T, ISTJ and ISFJ. So to describe myself I can be outgoing at work and make jokes but once im at home I do not want to ever talk to anyone not my mom and not my 5 sisters when they visited(after a couple of days when they visited it was too much stimulation), I tend to try to be empathetic and emotional and willing to listen to people i like and i tend to be very easy going but harsh as well with those i don't know well(I work in customer service and I hold high expectations for customers) and blunt with customers if it can't be done it can't crush any hope of them escalating the issue.

isfp,"My mom and I recently discovered a bunch of videos from my childhood and I felt kinda emotional while watching it??? I wanted to tell my younger self to stop worrying about other people and just have fun. My younger siblings would make funny comments and do stupid things, but I was really quiet and well behaved in every video. 

I feel like I was super aware as a child... like way too aware of how my actions made other people think/feel. As a result of that, I never let myself be free, outgoing, and really shine like the artist/creative I know I could become. I think I was also always really pure and never understood that some people are just mean/don‚Äôt want to see you succeed before them.

isfp,"I wonder if my being this way is an (unhealthy?) ISFP trait. TL;DR at the bottom.

I honestly do not mind finding out that I was wrong about a factual matter. I don‚Äôt mind having been wrong when something doesn‚Äôt turn out the way that I thought that it would. I‚Äôm actually self-deprecating and laugh at my faults and mistakes easily. I‚Äôm trying to say that I‚Äôm not hung up on being right. I‚Äôm currently struggling with a difference of opinion between myself and my friend of longest standing. We‚Äôre in our fifties and have known each other since our late teens.

I mostly got over, but have never forgotten, that we strongly disagreed on an ethical debate 20+ years ago. The issue was whether a law should be changed to allow (adult) adoptees access to their original birth certificates containing their birth mothers‚Äô names from ‚Äúclosed‚Äù adoptions. Neither of us are adoptees or have placed a child for adoption. We debated and argued our sides but neither of us changed our mind. He said with a laugh, ‚ÄúI guess we can‚Äôt be friends anymore‚Äù and I faked a chuckle. I really really did not like that he was on the side he was on, but I didn‚Äôt consider dropping him as a friend. We never brought the subject up again, but I still think about it now and then.

The current issue, which is a bigger deal to both of us than the adoptee rights thing, is about respect for the police. We are in the US. We both hated the police in the suburb in which we grew up and the large city nearby. Now we both live in the same city again, but in a different state than the one where we grew up. A few weeks ago we saw each other for the first time since quarantine. When we were on our third beer, he told me his thoughts on our local police, police in general, and the anti-police attitudes and protest methods locally and nationally. We‚Äôre on opposite sides of this. I am very disturbed by his attitude, especially due to the reasons he gave for his stance. 

We had just started raising our voices (highly unusual for both of us) to each other when the pizza delivery arrived. It was just as well that we were interrupted, because we‚Äôd both made our cases and, while I‚Äôd successfully refuted a couple of his points, neither of us was softening our stance on the big picture. If it would have continued I would have voiced a couple things that I was thinking about him personally that would have insulted and maybe hurt him. We ate our pizza, watched a movie and called it a night without going back to what we were arguing about. Like the adoptee rights issue, the police issue doesn‚Äôt and probably won‚Äôt materially affect either of us. We‚Äôre both white and decades past doing anything that will attract attention from police. We‚Äôve both been arrested and we both have been hassled and mildly abused by police when we were in our teens and early twenties.

I don‚Äôt really *want* to end this friendship, but I don‚Äôt know whether I can stay in it. I talked about this with the person closest to me, but I didn‚Äôt get any clarity about why I feel this way or what should be the way forward. I‚Äôm not asking anyone here to resolve my feelings, just wondering if you guys think my massive loss of respect for my friend and possible inability to get over this thing is an ISFP issue. Advice gratefully accepted but not expected. Thanks for reading.

TLDR: I am struggling with whether I can remain friends with someone that I disagree with on an ethical matter that is important to me but does not materially affect me. Is this an ISFP thing?",1600225272

isfp,"I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm most likely either INFP or ISFP at this point. I def think I have strong Fi, probably weak Te, and just about every test I take is INFP with ISFP here and there (I am wondering if I‚Äôm getting mistyped as intuitive) so I writing a thread about how I think I relate to INFP‚Äôs and ISFP‚Äôs aux and territory functions respectively to see which one fits me more:

**How I might be Ne:**

\-I‚Äôve made some ‚Äúconnections‚Äù between things before. Like how I think the inside of a jawbreaker looks like those science book illustrations of the earth‚Äôs layers. And being able to see faces or characters in dumb things like floor tile patterns and wall plastering. This can also be negative, I‚Äôm prone to falling for conspiracy theories and see patterns where maybe there isn‚Äôt something there and I‚Äôm just paranoid. (but that could just be my OCD)

\-I make up conversations in my head, all the time. They flow seemingly naturally in my head. This is mostly more in a negative nature now, but in the past I would daydream about having conversations with people I wanted to know better.

\-I have interest in some abstract concepts, such as personality theory.

\-I like novelty and doing new things. I‚Äôm adaptable to change.

\-I can see multiple possibilities for the future about positive ways my life can go, what kind of colleges I want to go to, what careers I could pursue, what hobbies I could take up, what projects I could start, etc.

\-I have too many ideas for my own good. I have a list of creative projects I might want to start someday. More often than not, when I don‚Äôt act on an idea for too long, I lose interest and drop it even if I already started it.

\-I go ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù a lot, usually when I‚Äôm anxious, but sometimes not. (could just be my OCD)

\-I like stories that are ambiguous, open-ended, and leave you theorizing / interpreting.

**How I might use Si:**

\-I‚Äôm pretty nostalgic. Even over little things, like a grocery store we used to go to. I love revisiting things I enjoyed from the past, and can go off on things like, ‚Äúhey, remember when \_\_\_? / anyone else remember this?‚Äù

\-I can be sentimental. I feel tenderly towards things others might find silly. As a kid, I had difficulty parting with toys or other such things. I am better at parting with them now, but also my childhood holds a soft place in my heart.

\-I have a good memory, whether it be vocab/terms for a class, details about something I‚Äôm interested in, past events and when/where they happened, or the faces/names of people I know. I can remember details about memories I had from years ago, including when I was very young.

\-I think I relate a lot to Fi-Si loop. I sometimes reflect too much on past memories to find answers and get stuck in the past. I often think about the past, how things could‚Äôve been different if I did this and that, people from the past I still think about, reflecting on how the past made me who I am now, beating myself up or feeling guilty for past mistakes, etc.

\-I trust / respect most authority (apparently this is an Si thing?)

**How I might NOT be Ne:**

\-I like abstract concepts and theories, but have troubling executing my own abstract ideas, like through art or writing. Most of my art is representational in some way or another. I can write fiction, but not really poetry. I feel I fall short when it comes to expressing my emotions in an artistic way that is more ambiguous and interpretable. I feel like sometimes it comes out too literal and I don‚Äôt really like that.

\-I sometimes have trouble brainstorming. If I don‚Äôt get an idea right away from a certain prompt, it can take me time to come up with an idea I actually like. If I go out actively seeking for ideas I often won‚Äôt find them, as my good ideas come to me, rather than I go after ideas.

\-I don‚Äôt like when people push a meaning on something when there isn‚Äôt supposed to be meaning there. An example being the fact that a blank canvas can sell for millions at an art museum because ‚Äúit means something‚Äù when very little work was actually put into it. I like meanings and patterns, but it‚Äôs not in EVERYTHING.

**How I might be Se:**

\-I like doing and experiencing new things. I‚Äôm adventurous.

\-A lot of my hobbies (past and present) have been described as ‚Äúphysical‚Äù - making art, photography, enjoying nature, biking, (learning to) skateboard, swimming, field hockey. I love listening to music and sometimes playing video games which I‚Äôm not sure is more intuitive or sensory. My only ‚Äúnon-physical‚Äù hobbies are reading and writing. I wanna sing and dance and play music but that‚Äôs just not what I‚Äôm good at. I sometimes like to express myself through fashion and aesthetics and I heard that‚Äôs a sensor thing.

\-How I described my love for nature in a previous post: ‚ÄúI remember seeing a sky full of stars for the first time and being astounded, just wanting to look at it forever. My favorite time is dusk and I love the feeling of being out and about right before dark, and how beautiful the skies are, and how the light hits everything perfectly. My favorite season is summer because of the warmth of the sun, blue skies, green grass, colorful flowers, but I also enjoy the colors of autumn. Sometimes I‚Äôve wanted to just pull a Christopher McCandless and live in the wilderness, taking it all in, exploring.a‚Äô

\-I can sometimes notice things that others don‚Äôt. I‚Äôll see something in the corner of my eye, and it turns out to be a small animal or something, but no one else seems to notice.

\-This is more likely than not my ASD but: I like to feel the texture of things, like soft blankets / pillows, or twirling my fingers in my necklace chain. On the other hand, I dislike things like tags on my clothes or hair growing past my ears, I notice it too much and it makes me uncomfortable.

**How I might use Ni:**

\-Sometimes I had hunches or feelings of dread that came true, but they are far and few in between. The examples that stick to me in my head was this feeling I had that something was wrong between me and some of my friends doing several points in my life, and it turned out their feelings toward me were changing.

\-I think I could see Fi-Ni loop too, but not as much as Fi-Si. Sometimes I look at things I did in the distant or recent past and feel scared of potential social consequences in the near or distant future. I sometimes wonder what people from way back think of me now, if I‚Äôll ever run into them again (directly or indirectly) in either a positive ‚Äúfalse hope‚Äù or in a negative way, and if my failures will come back to bite me.

\-I think I‚Äôm insightful and can pick up on people‚Äôs hidden motivations or feelings sometimes but I‚Äôm not sure how accurate that is.

**How I might NOT be Se:**

\-I want to be in the present more but struggle to. I just have a hard time feeling attached to my emotions and environment in the moment, but I do want to. I want to be experience life as it is happening and feel in touch with the present moment, not the past or future as I tend to be. Nowadays I barely feel connected to my immediate physical surroundings or even my feelings because I‚Äôm just thinking constantly. Not sure if it was always like that, though it could‚Äôve been, but in a healthier way.

\-I don't follow the ""trendy"" crowd nor care what's really trendy or ""cool"".

\-I am not always aware of my environment and can lack spatial or bodily awareness. I can be clumsy and run into things, or knock things over. It takes me time to learn new physical skills, like driving. (could possibly just be my ADD or aspergers)

\-I really, really, don‚Äôt like competitive sports or physically taxing activities. (unless it‚Äôs field hockey, biking, hiking or swimming. I like those things.)

\-I‚Äôm not great at processing present information sometimes, I tend to space out a lot and miss details. (could possibly be my ADD or aspergers)

**Not sure on:**

\-I feel I can be either ‚Äúhead in the clouds‚Äù or ‚Äúdown to earth‚Äù depending on the situation.

\-I use a mix of figurative and literal speech. I can also be blunt at times. I get my ideas across better when writing rather than speaking, where I stumble over words and can‚Äôt plan out exactly what I need to say.

\-I‚Äôm really introspective.

\-I can be daydreamy, sometimes.

\-I like to write fiction but work so much better when bouncing off on someone‚Äôs ideas (like post by post role-play).

\-People tell me I‚Äôm good at bringing out the ‚Äúsmall details‚Äù in my artwork (is that Si or Se? potentially both?)",1600092092

isfp,"Hey to all of you!
First of all, thank you for reading this. As the title says, I'm considering the posibility of being a mistyped INFJ.
They seem to be more similar types than they appear, at lest when trying to see them in myself.

I descovered MBTI a year ago, always tested INFJ, in every test, but I keep having doubts and over analyzing over and over again.

That actually resonated with me a lot. But the more I consume more information, the more doubts about that appeared.
Mainly because the principle of 'you cannot see yourself'.

I personaly like the Objective Persobality System (have you heard about it? Any thoughts on it?) I've been watching their videos and theories for quite some time. And I like it, I think it helps me understand how to grow and work on the inferior functions.

The thing that I see clearer it's the Ni-Se. When I think of Ne or Si. Those functions just doesn't make sense to me.
I constantly thinking of posibilities and perspectives about things, and trying to narrow down. At work, I don't like when someone throws at me 'let's try this, that, that..' to 'see what happens'. That it's kinda of a nightmare to me and a lack of responsabilty of being able to think first, then act, or at lest try to make into reality your visulization.
I don't think I have Si either. I wouldn't even know how to define it well, to be honest, just anecdotically define it: I don't feel attatched to the past, don't have the best memory (unless it's attatched to a visual or audio stimulus, in that case I can remember pretty well).

Then the Fi-Fe Ti-Te... They are kinda confusing..
At first Fe resonated a lot with me, because I see that it tends to be my way of interacting with others (valuing harmony, honesty, having a good hability to sense others emotions) but that actually I think it's quite applicable to Fi as well.. 

The thing that confuses me the most it's Ti-Te.. being an INFJ would mean I have Ti 3rd. And ISFP would make Te inferior.
I steuggle to see myself not using T, because I always though of myself as such a logic person. And people seem to tell me that I'm quite analytical and they like my insights about things. But this may be me overcompensating for the lack of T and teying to appear that way, who knows.

If I were INFJ Se inferior would make me quite out of touch with the enviroment. I like to go to the 'Ni Land', I'm often there, thinking, reflecting, simulating conversations or situations, but I don't think I lose the sense of overall 'groundness'. I see that in contrast with one of my sisters, whom I kind typed as INFP, and ahe kinda gets lost in the N, and really forgets about the physical world, maybe getting lost on street, or not knowing how to use an app, or things like that. And, in that regard, I'm quite the opposite. I almost don't have to think of my surroundings and almost feel like I'm hyperaware of them.
But I have to say I constanlty think of the future and am not that capable to just relax and not worry.

I like to excersize while I listen to some podcast or something and don't have to think about so much about what my body it's doing.
I also play piano, went to the conservatory when I was young. Audio and muscle memory work wonders with this.
All of those things, and more, could be Se related.

The only thing that I do not see it's, in the case of being ISFP, the Se drive to do things 'outside', go out of my comfort zone, new experiences, etc.. I like outdoors, I like the sun, the nature, but I have to be in the mood to go out and seek that.
Having said that, I notice that my mood it's often altered by weather, I love rain too, but when a few grey days has passed and suddenly the sun comes out, I feel another kind of energy in me.

IP vs. IJ
I kinda can see myself both ways, even I don't think I plan to much to be honest, I'd like to think that I do, and I think I often could make myself look that I do to compensate.
Also, I learned to be much more organized over the years, and to focus on little details, mainly because of my work (Film and Advertisement Editor) that I had to learn to be methodic. Once I gain that hability (mainly copying, then adapting it to my liking and personal needa, but it's not that ot came 100% from my mind) I'm able to carry that pattern into other areas. That is actually another easy thing for me, picking up and understanding different processes and patterns and maybe aplying them to other things.

So what do you think,
Am I close of any of this types, or maybe another one?

How are you seeing the Fi-Fe Ti-Te coins in you?
And what abou that lead Fi and Se?

My ISFP friend/crush who I was certain had a crush on me sort og ignored me yesterday and even when my friends mentioned me in the gc she didn't really say anything. So my friend and her talked about their celeb crushes but she was acting quite awkward actually-
I just don't really know why she's behaving like that but it kinda upset me? She could have been mad or I don't know.. because my other friend told me ""good night, my angel"" in the gc. (By the way wtf, she knows about my crush on her-)
I'm sorry this is all over the place but I'm just so confused, she gave me all the signs of mutual interest and suddenly that.

isfp,"I will show you exactly which type Chase Joseph Simonis is. 

First of all let‚Äôs compare his body mannerism to Charles Manson.

Charles Manson:

[https://youtu.be/YxxH6xm\_ZVg](https://youtu.be/YxxH6xm_ZVg)

Chase :

[https://youtu.be/gHWCn5-EWkQ](https://youtu.be/gHWCn5-EWkQ)

As you noticed, their body mannerism is identical‚Ä¶ Do you know which type is Charles Manson? Charles is an ESE/ESFJ. Vultology wise you would classify both Charles and Chase as FeSi Directive I-I- with flat affect (at the current level of development in the above mentioned videos).

I used Charles Manson as an example to get my point across, but if you know any ESE/ESFJ in real life you can try comparing his/her body mannerism with Chase and you‚Äôll see my point.. One of my parents is an ESE/ESFJ‚Ä¶ Same body mannerism as them. 

Let‚Äôs countercheck his functions just to be sure, because vultology is an interesting tool but cognitive functions reign supreme when it comes to typing.

Nova and Grimm, two former mods of his, released a series of videos backed up with proofs on their discord server, about the true behavior of Chase. The way that he acts on video and how he acts on real life? Extremely different.

This is one of their videos. I invite you to see all of them, so you get an idea of whom you‚Äôre dealing with 

[https://youtu.be/rOw\_OHzZT2s](https://youtu.be/rOw_OHzZT2s)

*(1:14-1:55) &lt;&lt;He had zero schedule. Like that was why I was gonna be hired on... It's the fact that the dude couldn't schedule to save his life. Quite literally kept on calling me being ""Oh my god I'm gonna die of stress because of my scheduling. And you really got to start  working for me soon because of this"". No seriously, the dude cannot abide by a schedule. You make him schedules unless you hound his ass to keep that schedule. He is not gonna keep it and he is just going to do what he wants to do anyway.&gt;&gt; (Nova about CS Joseph)*

That‚Äôs not a signal of Te Leading/Base user. That‚Äôs the signal of a Fe Leading/Base (first slot in MBTI) with Te Role (eight slot in MBTI)

Te Role: *‚ÄúIt is manifested as a need to appear efficient, productive and knowledgeable in their endeavours, as long as that does not conflict with priorities set up by their base function Fe. For instance, they may end up defending a decision or action that is not the most efficient but it is the one they see as most desirable in order to achieve or maintain the emotional atmosphere they are aiming at (for instance, not be seen as hostile to a given person or group).‚Äù*

Which, in Chase‚Äôs case, the main priority is to keep his cult active and receive their adulation. As well as to milk them out of their money whilst not providing adequate  services in exchange. 

Chase occasionally engages with Te Role, often negatively when he is anxious. That‚Äôs why he can give at times ExTJ vibes. When a Fe Leading engages in Te Role, their warmth is temporarily turned off as Base and Role cannot be turned on at the same time *(they represent opposite ways to the same goals).*

Chase is horrible at typing, not taking properly in account enneagram for basic motivations and that MBTI/socionics covers information metabolism *(it‚Äôs not an automatic skills detector).* Chase uses stereotypes a lot, making a quick decision about what he feels it‚Äôs the personality type of someone and seeking biased information to confirm his initial feeling. That‚Äôs congruent with unhealthy Si Creative (second slot in MBTI) in an ESE/ESFJ, relying only on own personal experience and disregarding others‚Äô experience plus being closed minded at the same time. That‚Äôs why, if you don‚Äôt fit his stereotypes, he‚Äôll immediately attack you claiming that you‚Äôre mistyped when it‚Äôs not necessarily the case. And, if you decide to have a coaching session with him, as pointed by his ex mods he will listen to you just a few minutes at max, then he‚Äôll bully you into thinking that you‚Äôre a certain type. 

As confirmed by Nova and Grimm, Chase lacks the sense of timing in planning. For instance rather than increasing slightly and progressively the price of coaching to deal with overbooking in that period, he immediately doubled the price of his coaching. Which, as they pointed out, it killed the amount of coaching requests. 

Such a ‚Äúworld burning behind his feet‚Äù sensation is a strong indicator of Ni Vulnerable (seventh slot in MBTI):

*The individual prefers to focus on immediate tasks, taking things as they come, rather than try to evaluate the outcome of present trends. Inclination to tell stories or narrate events on a sequential basis, rather than outlining how one event led to another.* ***He perceives time in an undifferentiated manner: the past, present, and future are all perceived as being in or near the present. When talking about the future, especially one's longer-term plan), the individual treats it as if it were accessible today and often is not aware of all the developments that must happen first. He generally has a poor sense of how long things will take and what the best amount of time to spend on things is.*** *Therefore it is difficult for him to stay on schedule without extensive, even total, pre-planning.*

It confirms that he has Ni Vulnerable, meaning Chase has Ne Mobilizing (third slot in MBTI) with hidden agenda to be perfect:

*The individual deeply appreciates people who are full of ideas and imagination and who give them a sense of connectedness to what is happening ""out there in the world,"" even if this information cannot be applied practically at the present moment. He is even more grateful for people who provide insightful ideas and unconventional analysis to enhance what he is working on or going through at the present moment.For example you can notice this, from Nova‚Äôs videos, from how Chase is obsessed by reading ‚Äúget rich quick books‚Äù. That‚Äôs a typical example of Ne Mobilizing in business.*

What about him referring so much to others when it comes to ideas? It doesn‚Äôt necessarily imply that Chase values Te. Chase has a very bad developed Ti Suggestive (fourth slot in MBTI) as you can notice the facts exposed in Nova‚Äôs video. Chase is unsure about his own thinking capabilities, even if he doesn‚Äôt openly admit so, and that‚Äôs why he refers so much to other people‚Äôs work.  It‚Äôs not uncommon to see that behavior in Fe Leading/Base users.

Yes, Chase is an unhealthy ESE/ESFJ. Looking at Nova‚Äôs video, it sounds that Chase has narcissistic-like tendencies (*with his cult acts like his narcissist supply*) and that he is a scam artist. We can infer that ENTP is a mask that he uses to avoid seeking help as well as to attract people in his cult.

Enneagram wise he is a 6w5 1w9 3w2 so/sp: *‚ÄúA dutiful social warrior focused on security, with a tendency of spotting people inconsistencies and criticizing them,  plus enjoying meeting and charming people.*‚Äù So/sp stacking motivates him to be a social climber. So/sp individuals may lack warmth (check) and are often awkward in 1‚Äì1 interactions *(check, you can see plenty of examples in Nova‚Äôs videos).*

isfp,"We all know how hard it can be to stick to a new habit. Picking up any good habit essentially lays the groundwork for a more successful and fulfilled life. There are, however, some habits that have a trickle down effect and make the adoption of other habits a lot easier. These are Keystone Habits.

Keystone Habits are those changes to your life that create a domino effect and carry over into other aspect of your life.

One of my favorites is Exercise - Studies have shown that people who regularly exercise tend to eat healthier, consume less alcohol, be more productive at their work and sleep better, than those who don‚Äôt.

Some of my other favorite Keystone Habits are:

* Meditation
* Journaling,
* Building a morning routine.

The incorporation of these particular habits in your day can have the most unexpected positive ripple effects that you‚Äôll end up being so happy with. I explain this in great depth here - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-\_2KVEVh6A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-_2KVEVh6A). Give this a try with your habit building.

This also turned into attraction and eventually we developed feelings for each other, but he was not aware of mine since I decided not to tell him because he had a girlfriend at the time.

His relationship ended a month or so ago and we started dating I guess?? Since I did not want to jump into a relationship right away. It's been great, he's super affectionate, seems genuinely interested when we talk to each other etc. He was even more ""clingy"" and attention-giving than I was since I have a lot of trust issues from past history with him and other people. He's aware of these issues.

The problem I'm facing now is there has been 3-4 days of him being cold. He responds slowly, doesn't seem as invested, no good morning texts etc etc. I confronted him and told him if he loses interest or wants to mess around with other people he has to let me know. He said ""ofc, I would never mess around with other people though"" ""don't stress about it"" etc. But he still keeps acting cold and not invested at all. Although he uses terms of endearment still which is confusing.

I'm pretty sure if I would ask him about it he would just deflect everything and tell me nothing is up, he's fine, just busy (which I know is not true, he is free all day).

Does he just want space? Is he losing interest and not telling me? Why is he going from one day being the most loving and attention giving guy to being cold the next, is it just an ISFP thing? Do I confront him again and risk being an annoying, clingy almost-girlfriend?? I'm not sure what to think or do.",1599806540

Normally I'd feel happy updating my CV.

Instead, I felt incredibly down. I spent my 20s building up a resume of impressive experiences and skills. And looking back in it... it was really boring.

I spent a decade of my life just trying to look good on paper.

And became burned out, miserable and unwell in the process.

I told my partner, I dont even want a single job right now.

I want freedom, adventure, new experiences.

And I don't want commitment or obligation.

So I am thinking about getting several part time jobs instead.

I know it isnt ideal financially and can be hard to juggle.

 I dont want another soul draining fulltime job that becomes monotonou where one day bleeds into the other.

isfp,"Are you prone to sensory overload? I often feel myself that way. It may seem that Se should make you more tolerant to huge amounts of sensory information, but it seems that it's more of stereotype, since Se is just about observing the outside world. It seems that my Se is tuned to more nuanced and less intence expirience, so in times like spring, or places like clubs, when sensory becomes overflooded with information, I often feel deafened, but at winter, autumn and, suprisingly summer or at night, when you find yourself in silence and can expirience all the sounds and hues you couldn't detect othervise, I feel myself very comfortable. 

I remember my first time in Paris when I accidentely got into Tuileries park and I was mesemerized by all the sculptures there and Louvre exterior. I was walking there full of awe and at one point suddenly felt huge discomfort. My feeling became so loud and intense, that I couldn't identify any of them and just was stunned by the whirlwind of emotions. I sat down and stared at the ground for quite some time. It was unpleasant for me even to look at the sclptures and exterior, as if they where radiating something blinding. I spent the rest of the day walking anyway and absorbed even more of Paris expirience, so it seems that I recovered quicky.

I also had headache for he rest of the day after an outdoors painting class mounth ago, when we had to paint in as INTENSE colours as possible (something like Gauguin). Befere that dreaded lesson we had to paint as subtly as possible and I was feeling great and reacharged after observing nature and painting it in tender and light colours, but Gauguin style... Never again :D

On other hand I love to expirience sensory things. It is so cool to sit in darkness and play the same interval percieveing it as purely and deeply as you can, to be enchanted by drawing and being unable to stop looking at it, feel the smell of autumn at the end of summer, wind blowing through you hair and just BREATHING :D

isfp,"Hi.

I should offer a disclaimer before proceeding with my, erm, thoughts- I am sort of awkwardly wedged in between the sensor/intuitive spectrum; I am certainly IXFP though. The manner in which I may go about trying to communicate my thoughts might be reflective of my intuitive tendencies; the topic concerns a potential sensory preference. If I could please ask to be bared with, I am curious as to whether my following perspective on art- to specify, the example I have mind: anything depicting scenery, whether it be nature or architecture- is an oddity or not.

I tend to have a greater connection or sense of interest in art that relates to a topic that has tangible relevance to my life and what I've experienced. To remain consistent with the example of nature, I have a fondness for railroads in nature scenery, whether it be in between an enclosure of trees or by a lake. This is the case, because I've always enjoyed walking along railroad tracks (when it's safe) and I've almost always heard train horns nearby places I've lived, so it's a sensory input that I've associated with the comfort of home- of course, this could be a sense of nostalgia that extends beyond the ISFP personality model. 

Artwork that I tend to have more difficulty enjoying includes pieces that have not had any tangible, sensory impacts on my life prior. An example is video game levels in which the artwork is depicted with the intention of being atmospheric and mysteriously beautiful; I don't really get much of a sense for that unless I have associated tangible experiences. This is not to suggest that I fail to see beauty in things I do not have physical experience with- it's a matter of having a greater appreciation for it when I have tangibly experienced the topic of the art.

I would like to offer a sincere apology if this type of post is not allowed. So, I am uncertain of the credibility of 16 Personalities as perceived by Reddit, but the result that has come up for me most often is ISFP-T, second to that being INFP-T. I believe that I feel certain about the majority of the personality aspects, but there is a lingering uncertainty...

To indicate which traits I am more certain about, it is the I, F, and P aspects. I definitley get my energy from solitude. I am more of a feeler, leaning more towards compassionate thinking than what is just, as well as being more prospective. 

It's the difference between being a sensor or an intuitive that I have had much more uncertainity and difficulty with, I think I tend to shift in between the two. In terms of being intuitive, language is an area in which I appear to be talented in and my mind does wonder to future possibilities. However, I almost wonder if I am more of a sensor as being in the present moment seems more congruent and natural to my thought process, along with having a sense of being more ""action-orietened"".

When I was like beefing with my bestf, she and her bestf like consoled me and said that my bestf is shit and it is natural that I feel this way. Then she and my bestf went to hang out tgt and suddenly they got really close, the day they hang out tgt was the day I realised that I treated my bestf like shit. Oh and they also encouraged me to confront my bestf ( I did it in a nice manner ). So after the day Beth and bestf hang out, I saw them becoming really close and I got very upset because they were also kinda ignoring me. I couldn‚Äôt approached them because I felt as if there was a barrier between us and just couldn‚Äôt go. So fast forward to like 5 days later, I confronted them and somehow when they I became the bad guy. I told Beth like ‚Äò A week ago you told me that you don‚Äôt like my bestf and now you are hanging out with her like nothing has happened‚Äô she told me ‚Äòyou know my character one second I like a person the next I don‚Äôt‚Äô and I asked them why they were ignoring me and they said that I always give them the blackface and I always seem like I was mad them. Truth to be told, yes I do have a really bitchy face now with mask it just becomes worse, they also said that it‚Äôs because of my tone. I never intentional did all those things to them. And somehow like all the things they accused me they have done it to me too. Also Beth said ‚ÄúYou should have come to me when you felt ignored but you didn‚Äôt‚Äù My bestf also told me like after the confrontation she couldn‚Äôt talked to me because I was always glaring at her but truth to be told I was not I kept looking at her so that she would like at me back and like confront me so that we can talk. So I retaliate and said ‚Äú the same you guys felt when you couldn‚Äôt talk to me because of my face and felt like I was mad I felt the same way too‚Äù but that statement was not validated by them. Best part Beth laughed at me while I was melting down, in that moment you can see how psychopath she really is. I told them that don‚Äôt they find this friendship toxic and Beth replied ‚Äú our friendship has some level of toxicity but that what‚Äôs makes our friendship special‚Äù. Things work out but honestly, In my heart I feel something was off. Like something is really off. I even told them I didn‚Äôt want to be friends with them because I‚Äôm just going to hurt them but they kept insisting that I don‚Äôt hurt them while still talking shit about me? I just know deep in my heart something is really off. But during the last confrontation, I admit I was too emotional I had my PMS. My exams are coming up ( it‚Äôs a big one) and the day where my bestf and Beth met it was the day I poured my heart out to Beth and told her I was indeed feeling suicidal. At one point during the confrontation I told them about me being suicidal and how I have only that one thing that is holding me back from commuting suicide and Beth was like ‚Äú if you really want to commit suicide maybe - ‚Äú I cut her off and said ‚ÄúDo you really want me to vomit suicide?‚Äù She said ‚Äúno‚Äù and my bestf said ‚Äú I want you to be happy and find other things that will not make you want to commit suicide other than that one thing keeping you from dying‚Äù that like honestly touched my heart. So why I am conflicted because I‚Äôve seen times and times Beth being there for me when I have my breakdown like 5 years ago when the same shit happened. My first like biggest depression moments. She was there. Even during the confrontation, I could see the hurt in her eyes that she punched the toilet door because she was angry. I didn‚Äôt like seeing her hurt. My bestf was crying too and I just could see how much they care about me. Am I just delusional? Or is there really something off? I‚Äôm all for honesty because ppl try to protect me by lying but it‚Äôs doing me more harm then good. I prefer to know that I‚Äôm a shit person the ppl covering it up by saying I‚Äôm good. Help, I literally can‚Äôt sleep because of this. I feel so guilty. I will answer any questions",1599133871

But i see that we were both quite young and we are both in the growing stage I now realize. And tho I can grasp the logical point of things it's been hella rough emotionally. For me I'm realizing it's hard to be vulnerable with my deepest feelings and insights. I have received many times advice to just get thru it, or let it go. Tough advice I guess, and i can see it from their point of view, but for me logic isn't everything. I value it a lot and I've been learning to develop it more. And to be honest I've gotten quite good it it. Academically I've done very well and many things I would overachieve. Im quite good at debates and I like an intellectual challenges. I find myself reading a lot about philosophy, meaning of life, self development, and books on meditation and etc. I push myself hard but with a breakup it's a whole diffrent ball game. Above all else I want to go about it truly the right way. She was the one that broke up and it wasn't anything involving cheating or a big fight. In fact we clicked very well and it was going that way for about 4 years. But the main thing is us both finding ourselves. I haven't talked to her in 3 months and I was surprised to hear how cold she was in the breakup. There was no emotion or anything. I can understand where she is coming from. I decided to write a letter but I dont feel like I've adequately am able to reflect my thoughts and self. My sister an infj told me that she felt she was taking our relationship for granted and felt it was one sided that I was giving more. I can see how maybe I could of been blindsided in ways. But I know she has a good heart. I see how ppl dealing with hurt can act in ways different than themselves. But I dont know, i realize theres so many perspectives. And that what I see isn't everything. Bit it's like what do I choose. I've been maybe overthinking. I would read and study the mbti and compatibility and the ennegram. And then try to find answers. I started really existential not neccessary over her but in my questions and need for meaning. I do t know the best way to write. Some ppl say to cut off contact bc person took you for granted and dumped you. They have to learn what they missed. Or do I write it saying how I still care for her and love her and try and balance it with being reasonable. Theres a lot...kinda frozen here.

We became distant in the last few months because I moved to another city. She had previously said she was fine with long-distance relationships. Not knowing what was wrong, I moved back and tried really hard to meet with her, but eventually she just texted me saying that she decided to give up on the relationship because she had too much pressure from her family business and her mom wanting to move to another city to be closer to her relatives.

I understand her not wanting to meet because she is the kind of person who is not very good with words, especially when it comes to emotions.

I know she is a good person, because she told me the family business was not what she wanted to do at all but something she had to do. I really don't think she's going to enjoy it because her dad developed his entire business based on relationships, and the industry is primarily dominated by men and involves lots of drinking. I actually met with her mom recently and through the exchanges I had with her and her mom, I get the sense that her mom, who also has breast cancer, is putting a lot of pressure on her to run the business and to move to another city. I can also see why my ex maybe has to listen because her mom is sick. But it seems to me that she is really suffering and I am quite certain she was happy with me and living where she is now. I just wonder if there is anything I can do. Can I talk to her mom to go easy on her daughter? Can I offer to marry her and help with the business?

isfp,"Hello, I am an INTJ male and I have a complicated relationship with my ISFP girlfriend. We are both 30 and we have our jobs. We have been arguing every couple of weeks for the last few months and she started all the arguments we have ever had. It is really frustrating for me to deal with her mood changes and when she becomes angry there is no way to discuss things rationally. I have recently discovered the  MBTI  and this has put my mind at ease a bit because now I have something ""scientific"" I can work on and there are communities like this that can help me understand her. 

The main points I would like a piece of advice are:

\-ISFPs get easily anxious for very small things and if I try to analyze the situation to help her, I get an angry reply. Should I just leave my girlfriend to resolve the problem alone staying silent? Should I try to be more empathetic providing only emotional support even if I have a list of possible solutions?

\-Despite the fact that she is naturally pretty, my girlfriend has got low self-esteem and this leads her to be jealous of my female friends and to look for constant signs of appreciation from me. I have spent hours explaining how being jealous is pointless and I can't treat her like a spoiled princess all the time, I expect some independence from a 30 years old woman. My gestures of appreciation come through small daily things such as bringing breakfast in bed, cooking for her, going out to buy something she needs whilst she comfortably stay on the sofa drinking her tea... How an ISFP feels appreciated/loved?

\-This last point is the hardest because it involves the communication difficulties we have. I know now that ISFPs have a low threshold of attention and they can't bear a person talking for half an hour analyzing a single topic because they lose interest. Tha's fine now, I accept it, but this problem becomes important after our arguments where I give details reasons for why I think she overreacted to something I did or didn't do and she can't reply proving me wrong. The day after though she doesn't remember much of our conversation so my question is how can I trigger changes in an ISFP mind so that she can think about what I said and think that she shouldn't overreact in the future?

Timeboxing is a technique that was made famous by Elon Musk, who is known to work over 80 hours a week at his various companies. The method essentially promotes blocking out a fixed amount of time for a task and then moving on to your next task once the time has elapsed.

I'm very curious on how this is.

Whenever my sister or mother was into religion at some point, I just couldn't stand it. I even tried it myself in college and did Bible studies and just decided it was not for me. 

And my objections have nothing to do with science. I'm well aware that science is severely limited and can't really be used to define our world... my problem is that super specific faith based systems like religion don't fare much better. 

I think we as humans just don't know everything and we should just come to terms with that.

TL;DR: An ISFP girl showed signs of interest but declined every invitation and then coldly at me.

I am a male INFP (28) and have never dated before, but recently had an interested in an ISFP (19) girl in a drawing class. 

At first we had a very good relationship, talking, laughing, saying goodbye every time the class ended. But the situation became more awkward as I became more friendly and curious about her, and she started avoiding me. Just ""Yes or Ok"" (even it's not a yes or no questions)  every time I ask something, it makes me confused.

I thought she didn't like me so I stopped communicating, but then she had signs that caught my attention. After that we got back to talk but something was still awkward. The other day she didn't come to class, I texted her on facebook to see if she was okay. Then she invited her out for coffee, she refused because she didn't want to befriend too quickly. I was ok with it, but a week later she continued not to come to class, I texted asking again at the same time inviting to have a dinner, she refused and told me that she had a boyfriend (she confirmed not had a boyfriend twice before, a week before this happpened) then posted some photos with a boy on ig/fb even though never do that before. I'm fine then sorry for not digging into it well and thought I should stop here.

Then I met an old friend (female) in drawing class, we chatted happily and I ignored the ISFP girl most of the time. But I got the feeling she looked at me a few times, when class ended, she left very quickly (I usually left slowly so that I could walk near her, she seems like that too but I'm not sure). I thought it was over but until the next day, I accidentally looked at her, she was looking at me and made eye contact for a few seconds. Confused again !!!

I texted on facebook asking why, she refused to talk about it but she looked happy because I complimented her gaze. There were only 2 days left until she finished the class, the first day everything was fine until I went out and when she came back saw her smoking in the chair in front of the classroom alone (I don't know it's a coincidence or intentional because she often smoking with her friends). I sat next to her, asked for a cigarette and smoking with her, I asked a lot but she kept saying ""Yes and ok"". I asked her if I looked scary and she said ""I usually like that""(she is friendly with people) but the situation is much better than before.

The last day I saw her posting on facebook about two events, I liked it but didn't hit the interest button. I intend to buy a lighter for her and talk about the other 2 events later. But when I gave it to her she refused to accept it at first but still accepted it later when I tried. This confused my Fi and unable to ask about the other two events, I went home in a vague mood. Try to ignore it, i will ask her about these two events next day. But when I asked if I wanted to join as a friend, she replied with cold-hearted (angry?): ""I go with a boyfriend. I know you like me but I tried to show you signs of refused quite a few times. Hope you understand me."" At this point I don't understand any more.

Where are those signs? Why not ignore me in the first place? Why give me more signs of interest? Did I read the situation wrongly? Does she really care about me or just being friendly? Or do i push too fast? She is still watching my story on facebook, should i move on?
I thought about gave up this relationship like I did before, but this is the first time I've really tried and gone so far so I want to ask for advice/perspective from you.

I believe in a lively disrespect for most forms of authority.

I think the reward for conformity is that everyone likes you except yourself.

One of the keys to happiness is a bad memory.

If it weren't for the last minute, nothing would get done.

Happiness is pretty simple: someone to love, something to do, something to look forward to.

Creativity comes from trust. Trust your instincts. And never hope more than you work. 

If you're afraid to die, you're afraid to live. You can't have one without the other.

Language exerts hidden power, like the moon on the tides.

Lately I have been getting hugely analytical and self introspective regarding MBTI. I came to some sort of understanding that I use a lot of Fi and Ni.

An real example of this, is this morning when I went outside for a walk and was stuck in my head thinking about how I always piece things together in relation to my values and subjective opinions, that my thought process is very tunnel visioned and that this could therefore be an Fi - Ni loop, meaning that I‚Äôm making less use of Se and moving more of my focus to my values. I then realised that this is the reason why I get obsessed with things easily, because I tunnel vision and focus on things to fill the void inside my head.

I'm 19F isfj, and I've met this ifsp boy for a year and a half now. We study at the same uni and take some classes together. I think I've liked him since always but I layed low and avoided showing it. He also conveyed to be very shy.

During the year we began finding common interests and became friends, but he seems a little strange around me sometimes. I got mixed feelings, at times it seemed as if he liked me, by the way he looked and talked to me sometimes, but at times it seemed as he avoided me.

At the very beginning of this year, it looked like we were getting along and becoming closer bit by bit. Things were evolving fine, we were hanging out more but then COVID happened. The uni cancelled presencial classes and we went home, at different cities. 

I tried to keep in touch. Sometimes he answers fine, and we chat and it feels good. Sometimes he doesn't reply for ages. I'm not importuning him, I don't text him very often. But it bugs me that he is almost never the one to start the conversation. 

It seems like whatever we had going on at the beginning of the year just vanished.

I know it's impossible for you guys to determine if he is just shy of if he's trying to get rid of me, but I'd be very grateful for any thoughts on this you may have, or similar cases you've been through.

A: Achievable - Is it truly something attainable or are you planning on becoming immortal?

I need help understanding someone I‚Äôve known for ... 14 years ? 

She typed as ISFP in the ‚ÄúJupiter‚Äù test (with the circle graph) 

Huge long story resumed :

I ‚Äúloved‚Äù her since the first day I saw her.
We went back and forth actively and with a lot of drama during our teens.
We kissed and shit 1-2 times but it always seemed like she was stressing out every time.

We sent each other to fuck approximately 100 times in those  14 years but be it me or her we always seek each other. 
No matter the relationships, no matter the time.

Except that it started at 12, I‚Äôm 26 now and truth to be told even if I‚Äôm not actively in love with her since I‚Äôm 18, she breaks my logical brain with a single look. 

Recently she told me ‚Äúeven now I was one of the very few whom she cared about‚Äù 

In another conversation while joking about ‚Äúsaving people‚Äù she told me ‚ÄúI want to be saved‚Äù 

Except that, every damn time I ask her to see me there is always an excuse at the end to not do it.

To shorten it, I believe we have a connection, but her mind being kinda unhealthy makes her run away from me while not cutting the link.

I resisted for the longest time, I never could entertain a real relationship because she was always in the corner of my mind.

Now I‚Äôm 26, I have no problems looking for other women but her presence is a burden on my choices and I know it.

How could I try to ‚Äúunlock‚Äù the situation ? Asking for a date doesn‚Äôt work she flips out and says no 

I wanted to tel her bluntly ‚ÄúFor all these years we had some link, a link that I never have forgotten.
I‚Äôm never able to care for women for years, for not a single one. Except you, you never gave me anything but it‚Äôs been 14 years that I cannot forget about you.
I know you had a tough life, I known you don‚Äôt feel complete. But I want to do my best to make you be able to stand and save yourself.

I hate labels and get so anxious with them.. it took me a while to even come to grips with being an isfp. But I really don‚Äôt share much of myself for people to know me all that well to begin with. So it‚Äôs even more frustrating when they‚Äôre convinced they have me figured out",1597839285
isfp,"Ever since I was introduced to mbti I resonated perfectly with the INFP personality type, but there's also a lot of things about the ISFP that resonate with me, and now I don't know if  me resonating so much with INFP is because of my need to have a sense of belonging or if it's authentic.

I am confused and I really feel the need to figure this out, so I can better understand the why behind the things I do and how I think.

Here are some things about me that might give you better insight as to what type I might be:

I have a very vivid imagination

I tend to get easily overwhelmed by external stimuli

If I'm doing something that doesn't require much of my mental capacity, I cannot focus without something like a podcast, creepypastas, or music, because I get easily distracted by thoughts and what's happening around me (I don't have ADHD)

I'm scatter-brained and forgetful

I daydream a lot

I'm prone to use the avoiding defense mechanism (procrastinate, avoid thinking about problems)

I'm very creative

I enjoy doing extreme sports that give me an adrenaline rush

I love being in nature

I love hiking 

I get scared often by moderately loud noises

It's easier for me to draw something somehow related to how I'm feeling

I express my feelings through metaphors that are pretty open to interpretation, rather than through concrete language

I talk to myself a lot

Being around people for extended periods of time exhausts me (but I'm also enneagram 4w5, so this might be the reason)

When I'm not doing something that I enjoy or that keeps me grounded, I tend to retreat in my head

In a room full of people, I tend to observe the people first, outside I tend to observe the environment

I am fascinated by personality psychology, but I don't see myself pursuing a career in this

I am very empathetic

I have an interest in studying and interpreting body language

I find the human mind very interesting

I like computer science

I tend to get pretty paranoid about random situations or things I did

Sometimes I just know things

I speak quietly, I'm not a very loud person

Rules make me feel traped and uncomfortable

Routine tires me, but sudden change can also be very difficult for me, if I'm not the one who causes it.

Injustice makes my heart ache

Being too in tune with the world's issues in the here and the now drains me

I'm highly individualistic

I want to belong to a group and feel understood, but I want to be unique at the same time

I prefer dogs to cats, but I wouldn't have the discipline needed to take care of one

I love animals in general, and I quite prefer their company to people's

I feel really bad when I see animal cruelty

I tend to empathise with serial killers and feel bad for how their life turned out because of certain trauma they've experienced 

I usually listen to music for the message it conveys (if the lyrics resonate with me or with my beliefs, I love it)

I also like music that just sounds good 

I have 4 close friends to whom I talk and who know me pretty well, to varying degrees

I like making ""friends"" with whom I can do the activities I enjoy, and discuss about them (I'm saying ""friends"" because I'm not really talking to them about other things such as my personal life or my feelings)

I am very self critical

I worry about offending other people

I tend to look overly critically at everything someone says, just so I know what I should say to not offend anyone or get criticism. (I'm not doing it to hate or be judgemental towards the person)

I tend to take people as they are, and not try to change them

If I don't resonate with someone, I'm usually just going to stay out of their way

I try to avoid conflict at all costs

I usually surpress my anger and don't tell people off. Instead I turn it onto myself

I used to be very religious as a kid, and I also didn't cuss AT ALL, now I'm starting to slowly drift towards atheism and Idgaf about cussing anymore (unless it's in an inappropriate setting)

I don't like going to the beach, I prefer active relaxation

I am very open and accepting of different cultures and beliefs as long as they don't go completely against my moral compass

I am genderfluid, most of the time non binary or agender, and I've always struggled with my parents forcing gender roles on me. (I'm biologically female)

I would always find ways around most rules, as a child, but I would usually respect those in school, such as wearing the correct uniform, doing my homework, being a straight A student and thinking this is the only important thing in life (now I see how much of that was me trying to please my parents)

I'm demiromantic

I believe most people are good at their core

To me, no one is beyond help

I tend to stand up for the underdog

I have a very strong drive to do what's right and to be fair to everybody

I've always felt like an outsider and misunderstood

I've always been a very curious person and intrigued by novelty

I pick up a lot of hobbies but drop most of them once they start getting boring

Some of the hobbies I've stuck with are: snowboarding, guitar, drawing and sometimes writing


Thank you so much for taking the time to read all this! If anything else comes to mind, I will update the list, adding to the bottom of it. I also posted this on r/infp, but I was curious as to what you guys might think about it

He offered to buy me new ipad pro so I can work faster. 

I feel like I want to share this to my close friends, I know they will congrats me but in another hand, I'm afraid I would make them feel bad to themselves because they always complain about their career life and bad costumers. I realized I used to be like this before, I didnt want to tell my highschool classmates that I got in university because some of them also aimed for same university but they didnt get it. I didnt feel bad not sharing what I have got because I would feel worse if I shared my happiness but it hurts somebody else. 

I hardly share what I've gain because I don't know if anybody else would like to know but they have to congrats me anyway. I mostly write my diary and hold this good things with myself rather than share it to someone else how happy I am now.

I (M, 22, ISFP) have dated in the past few months a girl (25, infp) and we had our ups and downs.

Most of the time we get along extremely well, we spent a lot of time together that we found were amazing moments in life and we always felt vey trustful of each other. I really love having her in my life.
However in these complicated moments, she said a few times that I was selfish because of how I sometimes let my emotions take over without considering hers in my decisions.
And to be fair I felt the same way about her.

It's sad to see such issue coming up between us while everything else is going very well. Could that be a common issue between fi-doms? Would it be possible to do something about this clash of feelings?
She's not the best at communicating and although it takes time to built such a good communication, I'm considering moving on only if there is nothing to be done about it.

Unfortunately we live in different cities so it‚Äôs been hard to meet in person. However for a month, we are coincidentally in the same city.  We‚Äôve spent a couple of times hanging out 1 on 1 ( one of the nights she stayed over till 2 am just conversing and going to look at stars on the beach).  

In our one on one convo, she mentions her and her ex are trying to work things out but it‚Äôs been causing her a lot of stress and she thinks she‚Äôs going to be single and never be married her entire life which I found weird if she‚Äôs working on things w her ex ( they broke up a year ago) 

The other night ends up being her birthday and I was invited to her surprise birthday via a common person we know.  Her ex bf was there as well but after the night she ends up coming back to my house and we end up hooking up.  We then have a talk the next day saying she doesn‚Äôt want to put me in a hairy situation and it‚Äôs unfair to me.

We've been knowing each other for 3 years and she's never had any clear vision about what she wants to do. Now she decided to be a naval aviator and became obsessed with it (we're both 19 btw). The problem is, she doesn't see how much work it is to get there. To keep this short, let's just say it would take her at least 10 years and I know damn well she won't have the will-power for a long term plan of hard work like that and will end up being unmotivated and disappointed. 

It's hard to say what else she's passionate about because she's changing her hobbies seemingly every day (which is the reason I know she'll soon give up on her new goal too). She's rushing into something and dropping it the other month. I'm always trying to support her on every decision she makes but it's exhausting to put so much effort into helping her getting where she wants to be when she ends up not following through the plan anyway.

What would you want me to do if you were in her position? Should I just let her do her thing? Or would you want your friends to tell you what they're thinking?

Then, for the last few years, I've been consistently getting INFP. And while it always felt very very very close, I didn't actually know if it was right. I know for sure that the I F and P are right but the N has always confused me a little bit. Has anyone else had this happen? 

From what I can tell, both the S and the N apply to me. I am realistic and like to apply common sense and logic to situations.

isfp,"Hey there ISFPs!

So I've been doing some research on the cognitive functions of this type and am having some trouble understanding my connection to the dominant function Fi (Introverted Feeling).  


It's said that the moral system and values of a dominant Fi user are deeply-rooted and rarely influenced by the outside world. Dominant Fi users use this function to make decisions based on their personal values, which are often only discovered when another person steps over them.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel as thought most times though, I am very attentive to the values of the ones I care about. I tend to base my morals on those of people I admire or trust because they seem much more certain of their own than I do. If I realize that someone else carries a value or idea that contradicts my previous one and may be more accurate, I suddenly become insecure and uncertain of my moral system.

isfp,"Hey everyone.

My name is Oliver Powell. I'm a psychologist and my personality type is is ESTP 8w7 sx/sp.

I wanted to give all of you a warning, as I ran a check on the YouTuber CS Joseph and I found out that he's full of bullshits. He is a con artist and he is horrible at typology.

1. MBTI is about cognitive preferences. It doesn't automatically equal skills. Chase doesn't keep that in mind, so he ends up using a lot of bullshit stereotypes. No wonder that he mistypes a lot of people.
2. Any combo of enneagram and MBTI is possible. Enneagram covers basic motivations... But he disregards the enneagram, fusing automatically basic motivations within cognitive functions, ending up easily mistyping people. For instance he insists in claiming that Frank James is an INFP, when Frank James is an INFJ with enneagram 4w5.
3. Some of the concepts that he talks about are in a nutshell a bastardized version of socionics model A, but repackaged with different terminology. For instance his ""four sides of the mind"" are called in socionics model A as ego block, id block (unconscious ego), super id block (subconscious ego) and superego block.
4. He isn‚Äôt an ENTP as he claims. Chase is an unhealthy ESTJ (ego Te Si Ne Fi) 6w5 SO 613 often stuck in Te-Ne loops and on top of that he has most likely ASPD.

First of all Chase is a Te Dom:

4D valued Leading/Dominant Te: ""*Extroverted logic as base function is manifested as a need to accumulate factual information, also from external sources such as books, second-hand information, etc, on matters of personal interest or of professional activity. This also gives these types confidence on being well-informed on the same matters, which enables them to enter arguments related to them with confidence on their knowledge, which may come across as arrogance to others. Another manifestation is an evaluation of external reality - work activities, world events, finances, procedures, personal relationships, conversations - from the point of view of factual accuracy and ""making sense"" and efficiency. It leads to an inclination to be proactive in increasing the efficiency and reasonableness of the external world, as well as a sense of self-worth connected on being involved and productive in activities seen as useful, profitable, or that increase one's knowledge base. To give out information that the individual knows not to be factually accurate is disturbing and avoided as much as possible.""*

His second slot Si is poorly developed and he often turns it off, enganging often in Te-Ne loops:

*""ESTJs can also develop a warped or imbalanced use of their auxiliary function, Introverted Sensing (Si). When this happens,* ***they become obsessed with sticking to what they know, rapidly closing off alternate viewpoints and perspectives. They may become deeply upset by change¬† or they may become focused on seeing impracticalities in others. They may become so tied to their own personal, subjective experience that they discount other people‚Äôs experiences or are unwilling to see other perspectives.*** *Healthy Si is very aware of details, facts, sense-impressions, and important memories. It is practical, responsible, and highly attuned to changing patterns. Unhealthy Si feels that everything needs to fall in adherence with one‚Äôs own subjective experience of how things have always been.""*

\^ Hence the over-generalization that Chase makes all over in his videos.

Look at this description and you'll realize that his Ne is actually third slot, not first slot as he claims:

2D valued Mobilizing/Child: ""***The individual deeply appreciates people who are full of ideas and imagination and who give them a sense of connectedness to what is happening ""out there in the world,"" even if this information cannot be applied practically at the present momen****t. He is even more grateful for people who provide insightful ideas and unconventional analysis to enhance what he is working on or going through at the present moment.""*

You can see Chase often complimenting and appreciating people who are full of ideas, for example nominating in several occasion his mentor and talking about him.

Chase is often looping between Te and Ne:

*""When an ESTJ is in a Te-Ne loop, they are unable to effectively access their introverted functions, Si and Fi. During these times, they become obsessed with possibilities, but often in a negative light. They may see a million ways things could go wrong and try to ‚Äújump in‚Äù and fix them as quickly as possible without looking at the facts or taking the time to carefully observe the situation internally. They may have a difficult time prioritizing or reaching their goals and they may take hasty action on strange, intuitive whims without really understanding where their premonitions are coming from. This can be a very stressful stage for them as they feel more and more frustrated by their inability to organize, plan, and decide as effectively as they usually do. It‚Äôs important for ESTJs who realize they‚Äôre in a Te-Ne loop to get healthy access to Si. Take some time to enjoy some peace and quiet and reflect on an experience you enjoy. Find a favorite activity that you‚Äôve always enjoyed, whether it‚Äôs a crossword puzzle or cooking a certain meal, and repeat that process. Give yourself time to ‚Äúintrovert‚Äù and do some no-pressure detail-oriented project. Getting Si back into the picture will help you regain composure and get out of a loop.""*

As further proof of him being an ESTJ:

*- He finds Ni irritating (Ni being Vulnerable/Trickster for ESTJs), despising INFJs (the conflictuals of ESTJs) and having problems with INTJs (different methods to get effective results done).*

*- He praises a lot Ti, which in ESTJ is their Observing function, and in particular ISTPs. And the default communication style of ISTP is the best way to communicate with ESTJs.*

*- Love/hate relationship with high Fi users, but in particular xNFP types. It points to Fi Suggestive/Inferior.*

*- He is a more chaotic than usual for ESTJs due to being in Te-Ne loops.*

Some people think that Chase's main enneagram is 3w4, but what they're sensing is the disintegration phase of Chase.

Chase is an unhealthy 6w5.

*""Unhealthy 6w5 become increasingly paranoid and obsessed with maintaining their security, and may go to great lengths to protect their positions. They are extremely needy, and may abuse alcohol or drugs as a way of dealing with anxiety and paranoid delusions, as well as of bolstering their inferioirty feelings. The Five-wing adds elements of cynicism and nihilism to the fearful mentality of the unhealthy Six, resulting in growing isolation, desperation, and a capacity for sociopathic actions. Intense stress will likely lead to outbreaks of rage and extremely destructive behavior accompanied by breaks with reality. Self-sabotaging, self-destructive actions bring about humiliation and punishment to atone for guilt, although the extent and nature of their self-destructiveness will be hidden from others because of their reclusive nature. There may be strong propensity for violence as well as sadomasochistic tendencies in sexual expression. Murder and suicide are both real possibilities.""*

Primary instinct SO (social). Tritype 613, considering that one of his ex mentioned how much Chase tends to avoid conflicts (*main instinct core 1*) and his self esteem is based on achievements (*3 as main heart core*).

Unhealthy 613s disintegrate towards 349... 6 disintegrates to 3: competive and arrogant; 1 disintegrates to 4: moody and irrational \[*like claiming that the sperm becomes the brain, spine and nervous system... Look at the video analysis""What MBTI personality is sperm"" by FlowState lol*\]; 3 disintegrates to 9: \[disengaged and apathetic.

So the question is... Why he lies about his type?

The whole ENTP charade is how he justifies his unhealthy behaviours and avoids therapy.

Amongst his unhealthy behaviours, I‚Äôll mention that‚Ä¶

* Chase committed identity theft.
* One of his exes went to a therapist after frequenting him due to how much emotional damage he caused to her during their relationship.
* As mentioned by his ex Ande Sloeijk, Chase displayed behaviours that they‚Äôre congruent with someone with NPD (*amorous subtype*) or similar in their courtship.
* He persuaded a couple to avoid seeking help for their autistic son. Flowstate made a video analysis on the topic on Youtube. (**CS Joseph's Dangerous Advice | ""Ignore Your Son's Doctors"" | Criticism)**
* Pathological lying.
* A lot of passive-aggressiveness.
* Misleading information about his figure income to trick people into giving him more money. Flowstate made an approximate audit about Chase‚Äôs business (‚Äú**Cooking the Books: C.S. Joseph's Whopping 6 Figure Income Audited and Analyzed)**

It's highly likely that Chase has personality disorders. Probably ASPD in comorbity with NPD, but to say for sure a proper assessment would be needed.

Don‚Äôt donate to him. Don‚Äôt buy his services.

isfp,"Lately, I have been trying to resist any  ""easy path"" habits in order to improve my long term goals.

for instance, anytime i feel like procrastinating or ""ill do it in 5 mins"", i resist that urge and just go do it immediately

I've been known as a push over because we dont like menial confrontations. I live at home as an very adult child, but that's issues for another day. But as I live rent-free, I do pay for the energy bill. My brother moved in April because he couldnt get along with his gf's family (living at their house). We live in the central valley in California, so summers get to triple digits easy, but oddly enough the downstairs to the house remains really cool, like 77 inside even if its 100+ outside. So we run the ac when it's hot. I wake up at 4 - 5 am normally and the ac is always running! He brings his two big gaming monitors, gaming tower, game consoles, gaming laptop (no he doesnt make money off gaming, at all) and runs it all day and all night. He's streaming two different shows while he's gaming. ALL DAY ALL NIGHT.

The energy bill was over $1k last month. In efforts to cut it down, I'm turning off the air every time I hear it kick on. I came back home from walking my dog and notice the motor was running outside. (I am passive-aggressive and I'm trying to change that) I made comments, ""who turned on the AC, I just turned it off"" My brother replies, ""I did, it was hot"". That made me pretty upset because remember, he has all those electronics running in his room. I was planning on just walking away, but again I'm trying to step out of my comfort zone and speak my mind on this matter. Definitely, I should have been more tact, but the words that stumbled out were, ""i'm going to say this as nicely as i can, if it's too hot, turn off your electronics in your room."" 

He belted out ""Why are you so bi-polar?!"" very aggressively. We had a yelling match. He's probably offended that i assumed he wasn't doing anything besides gaming/streaming videos. But anytime I would try to argue the issues of ""being too hot"", only thing he had was to assassinate my character. I was raging with me pointing my finger at him and slamming my fist on the table. His responses were ""what, do you think im scared of you? im not intimated by you. im not a little kid anymore."" 

we went around in circles for awhile. He started asking questions like ""do you know everything? what do you know? do i look like a joke to you?"" deep down inside, i know he was saying this so i can just walk away and he felt like he won. Which was the exact response i got when i said yes to his question. He proceeds to say, ""since you know everything, since you think im a joke, what the fuck are you talking to me?""

Normally, i would walk away. I didn't feel like anything was resolved, and im still pretty pissed he wouldnt keep the yelling battle on point, it was just him, again, name-calling and assassinating my character. Yelling about how he's name-calling didnt get anywhere. At one point, he asked a question to his gf to look for confirmation. She paused, looked into his eyes, and muttered a ""yeah"". Terrifying. So, i took a deep breath and started over from the beginning. i apologized for my tone and the way i said it. I made it clear that the energy usage is too high, and he's starting to take advantage that he doesn't have to foot the bill. And that he needs to do more than just that at home. He still pointing fingers, not accepting any part of responsibility. At this point, I think i've done as much as i can as he thinks he's won because i've backed down, and maybe that's true. Just let him know that here was the issue, here is the solution, and i do take part in not being more tact. 

I'm actually very hurt at the things he said and also that he's living his life gas-lighting people who dont agree with him. He feels like he won, I feel like utter shit. But I am proud of myself voicing my thoughts and not walking away after all the name-calling, personal attacks, etc. 

If you stuck around to the end, great. Sorry for being long winded and probably confusing. I figured typing it out is much healthier than what i normally would turn to, get high and eat junk food.

Thanks.",1596945297

isfp,"There's been one thing that's bothered me during my MBTI journey and that's mostly that I have a very strong connection to the past. My emotional memory of certain moments have such sensory detail and vivid recollection. I have a deep longing for people who used to be in my life, and I have a strong avoidance of more negative past memories but I feel it still connects to my being. When I'm unhealthy I tend to relate to both the Si, and Ni loops, I get super fixated on reliving a past emotion and go to places I've been to relive that sensation BUT I also tend to worry about a negative future that I want to avoid and feel that no matter what I do I can't avoid that future outcome. I become paranoid and unable to focus on the present moment. I love being able to skateboard, waterski, any sort of individual adrenaline rush that can allow me to engage in reality around me and feel engaged, in a way the present is my healthy escape from future and past emotions if that case?

I really am certain I'm an ISFP, I relate so much to Se/Ni and I don't relate to Ne at all. I'm in tune with my body, love aesthetics, love feeling alive in the moment and connected to the tangible world,  but this past connection makes me wonder: Am I just an Fi-Si subtype INFP? An ISFP with a strong past connection? All the descriptions mention that ISFP's live and let live, and I feel that I can definitely be fixated on a past situation depending on its significance.

isfp,"The reason I'm asking this question is because I'm still not sure about Fi vs. Fe and Si. vs. Fe. Ever since i can remember I kept my emotions to myself. Even my ex GF often said I should start opening up and a good friend of mine, I trust her everything, once said I can't accept my feelings/emotions. Even when I look back at the worst time in my life I went through something I didn't even share with my parents. That sounds like a lot Fi yet but why do I often care about the group so much sometimes and why do I secretly seek validation when Fi is all about authenticity? A woman once told me that I'm fake but the person I trust everything said she thinks my biggest fear is probably to be seen as common. That just doesn't sound right to me and why do I seek group harmony when I'm actually more self-centered? I can remember when I was together with my ex and I often was indecisive because I considered her interests - is this Fe because I consider someone else? or was I secretly only after peace and didn't want to start a verbal fight? How can I tell if my Fi or Fe is stronger?

It's the same with Si vs. Se - I can remember things that happened 10 years ago very well but I might forget what I had for breakfast 3 days ago, I love making new experiences but I also love to re-watch the same TV shows over and over again, I can be very melancholic but yet not too past oriented, I can be greedy about money and I save a lot ( I write financial plans) but when I have enough I like to spoil myself, I sometimes come up with anecdotes and sometimes I describe things the way they are, I like to have my inner peace but sometimes I'm fine with things being out of order, I have routines but yet want changes.

Anyways that day my mom chuckled at the combo and so did I, but then went on to ask seriously ‚Äúhmm....I really wonder, about how you were dressed like as a teacher though‚Äù (I used to teach) trying to understand her statement I asked why she thought that when I usually don‚Äôt dress like that, it was just it was cold that day. She then yelled/snapped at me saying ‚Äú UH, I CANT have a conversation with you your TOO SENSITIVE for me‚Äù and when I tried to talk it out she told be to ‚ÄúSSSssh‚Äù. Not many things make me angry but this did it..... it was not the comment about the outfit but more the yelling and telling me am too sensitive. Am not sure how to address this with her, so far I have been acting like nothing happened, but it really felt like a gut punch.......",1596696810

isfp,"Hello, all you great ISFPs! 
I‚Äôm an INTJ(f) friends with an ISFP(m). I‚Äôm not entirely sure he‚Äôs an ISFP. Based on cognitive functions and things he does, he basically fits the ISFP framework. 
We‚Äôve known of each other for four years (classes together, mutual friends, etc.), we were in the same friend group this school year, and we only started talking in February. In school, we mostly hung out with all our friends, but there were times when just the two of us would have a side conversation or walk off from the group. Because I‚Äôm not as smooth when having romantic feelings, I accidentally acted like a fool many times in front of our classes. We always laughed about it afterwards. 
It took a very long time, many text messages, and lots of analyzing, for me to realize I deeply care for him. I think he cares for me too, and it took me a long time to see that. At first, I answered most questions he asked about me. He wanted to make it clear that we had each other‚Äôs backs, no matter what. I wanted him to open up more, but I respected that. I never pushed him to talk about anything, even when ‚Äúhow‚Äôs your day‚Äù texts became boring. We lost some contact during quarantine; we hate continuous all-day texting. When we texted again, I finally asked him why we keep trying to have boring conversations. I asked him if he wanted to be closer friends (he agreed that we should be better friends). Yes, that was very blunt, but he‚Äôs now aware of my straightforward communication. 
We‚Äôre texting often lately. I‚Äôm more patient now with the small talk. He appreciates the links I send while he‚Äôs at work. We have many things in common. He wants to hear about my day, so I try to make it sound exciting as possible. I‚Äôm considerably sarcastic, so he tries to make me laugh. I don‚Äôt know if we‚Äôd be good together, maybe we‚Äôd just be great friends. There‚Äôs much more that we bond over, and I think we both realize that. 

I want to know him, not from school memories and text messages, but as who he really is. What should I do?",1596676471
isfp,"Hi! 
Im going on what I believe is a date with an isfp tomorrow (I‚Äôm an enfp) and I want to tell him how I really feel about him.

The thing is - we‚Äôve been friends for three years, but the friendship started off as dating, only for me to get my heart dumped when he said he only liked me as a friend. Afterwards we‚Äôve hung out, we‚Äôve been flirty, and recently he‚Äôs asked me out to movies and such. He refuses to let me pay for anything but won‚Äôt really touch me unless it‚Äôs when we hug goodbye.

Tomorrow we‚Äôre going to a bar and I just want to know if he‚Äôs feeling the same as I am. I‚Äôm not looking for a relationship, and neither is he, but I‚Äôm scared to intimidate him if I tell him how I feel or kiss him out of the blue (or bluntly ask if he wants to come home with me).

How can I tell if he likes me, and what‚Äôs my best way to show him my affection without scaring him off? Any help is appreciated ‚ù§Ô∏è",1596668451

isfp,"22(m) INFP, just broke up with an ISFP gf and looking for advice. 

To give some background, we both attended the same college and had known each other for over two years. We got along really well, but I only mustered the courage to tell her that I liked her this past March (she got really excited and happy, telling me she had liked me for the longest time but hadnt said anything) - but then COVID-19 happened.

Somehow, we ending up spending a significant amount of time together during quarantine (Love during the age of corona lmao). I had to leave my dorm because of the virus, and found a place literally next to her so we basically spent all of quarantine together. It was super romantic, with movie nights and all the gooey-shit. I quickly found myself falling; I know she did too. Granted, there were times when she seemed a bit distracted(?) but when we were together, she clearly was into me too (like she would drunk call me, get super bashful when I complimented her, kinda obvious stuff).

The problem, however, is that I had enlisted in the Army and am due to go in this October, meaning that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to see her for at least two years. We knew this, but during this lovey-dovey stage, pushed off talking about it. I think we‚Äôre both conflict-averse and don‚Äôt really enjoy initiating tough convos (which would come to bite me in the ass).

The night before she had to fly back home, she cried and started telling me that she ‚Äúdidnt want to hurt me‚Äù and that ‚Äúi meant alot to her‚Äù. She never shows overt emotion like that, so I was really surprised. The next day, having given her time compose herself, I asked her if she wanted to try a LDR; I prefaced it by telling her that it would hard and communication would be difficult, and I was overjoyed when she said yes.

The first month or so was amazing, she showed alot more emotion than before over text and I was genuinely hopeful that it would work. She told me she missed me quite often, and would make little playlists of songs we listened to.

After a month, however, she started to get busy with work (like 8am - 9pm) busy, and I tried to give her space and be supportive; I know what its like to be overwhelmed with work. At the same time, I could sense a growing gap between us; she‚Äôd become awful at responding (to the point where there would be 24 hour+ gaps in between texts) and even when she did respond, her responses lead to nowhere. I felt that there was something going on beyond the work part that I wasn‚Äôt seeing (based on her replies) but wasn‚Äôt sure. I chalked it up to fatigue and decided to wait it out until it got better. This cycle of awful texting went on for a MONTH.

When I finally confronted her about communication, she got super defensive (which was not what I was expecting). At that point, I had dealt with the texting problem for so long that even though I knew she was busy, I stopped pretending like I was fine with everything and told her that she needed to tell me what was going on. After some more talking, we decided to take a break.

After we took a week off, I decided to ask her to breakup; based on her responses and the like, it felt like she had just wanted to end things and had just disappeared/ghosted me for no reason. At the time, I just didn‚Äôt want to have to go through the agony of waiting for responses all day; my own personal life is busy enough without any more problems.

After we broke up though, I‚Äôve been shocked to find that I‚Äôm still incredibly caught up on her. I think about her to the point that its affecting my personal life. We didn‚Äôt text for a month after the breakup until yesterday, when I wished her a happy birthday, but the feelings still won‚Äôt subside. Sometimes, I‚Äôm angry that she was so bad at texting, but at other times, I realized that she‚Äôs the type of person that needs her space (ISFP lmao). Given that backing out of the Army is a nonstarter, I know that we can‚Äôt be together, but what should I do? We also never honestly discussed why we were breaking up, which has come back to haunt me (it was ‚Äúcommunication‚Äù but i feel like thats bs).

For my mental health, I was thinking of calling her to tell her that I wanted to block her on social media, but that sounds so weak - she seems to have moved on (i have no idea) and I haven‚Äôt given her any reason to believe that I‚Äôm this emotionally affected. I also genuinely have no idea how she feels about me, whether she hates me or likes me or just doesnt care at all. Based on how she tends to act, I‚Äôm worried that she just straight up forgot I existed (isfp style). 

Tl;dr: should i tell my isfp ex that I need to block her for my sanity? How might she take it?",1596654554

Also, apparently I'm the most confrontational person in my class. Part of it is my sense of humor (telling people I'll fight them over the dumbest things or pretending to be mad if they don't accept my help), part of it is trying to help people. There's a girl in my class, I yell out her name, and she yells out ""confidence"", to help her build up self-confidence (it's working, and she really appreciates it). I think it's weird that people think of me this way, because i hate talking to strangers, but just like to have a good time. Another thing is sometimes people think I'm too mean sometimes when I make it obvious I can't stand someone and constantly tear them down, but I think they should know what everyone thinks of them, so they can realize their actions hurt themselves and everyone else.

However, I must say that at the end I sometimes get lost in thoughts. Not really lost, there is some kind of ""I'm here"" but when I'm jogging it might be that I stare down on the ground for a specific time and i sometimes get lost in my music while driving. I also realized that when I do something I always ask myself ""what's next?"". Maybe this is some developed Te but although I can focus on doing sports I sometimes catch myself organizing my thoughts while doing it and my inner to-do-list while being busy with this stuff.

isfp,"Hi there! 
(Sorry for any grammatical errors!)
I am an ENFP in a happy longterm relationship with my boyfriend, an ISFP. We have a harmonious relationship, we never argue and this is for both of us the first relationship. However, I dislike the way we handle conflicts when they arise. We‚Äôre both pretty avoidant about conflicts but if a situation occurs, (for example: his behavior hurt me at one point), I am the one to speak up. I tell him in a calming tone, being really catious with my words because I don‚Äòt want to hurt him in any way, that I didn‚Äòt like what he‚Äòd done. Somehow, he still takes my criticism personal, he gets really angry at himself and apologizes a hundred times. He says stuff like he doesn‚Äôt deserve me etc., stuff that isn‚Äòt true. I feel guilty because he beats himself up for this, and then I tend not to say anything at all and bottle it up. 
But this is not the healthy way ‚Äì I don‚Äôt want to pretend. But every time I speak up it‚Äôs like we‚Äôre in court and he‚Äôs sentenced himself to prison. I dont understand why he‚Äôs so hard on himself and I don‚Äôt know how to talk to him so he doesnt do this anymore. 
By the way, I dont remember the last time he criticized me for anything, even when I clearly did things wrong. I sometimes wish he would tell me, though.

I am now 32 and doing well. I bought my own house, I have a car, good investments and am totally independent. Pay my bills on time. 

I work as commercial sales executive for Apple. I was a team leader for a year or so.
 
I have a core group of friends. I dont really meet new people much or befriend them. My gf who is INFJ is always making a new friend here and there. She develops deep connections fast. I struggle.

I need time alone to recharge.

I am very caring, giving and supportive to those I hold dear but I can come across as cold and indifferent to those I dont. 

I am reserved with some social anxiety and it can be really hard for me to express emotion, I hold it in or mask it with sarcastic, self deprecatory humour. 

On the flipside, I can be charming and a jokester in some social situations. My ex always thought I was flirting at work, whereas to me it was just banter.

I am good at practical things like driving, putting together a bbq, playing a guitar, riding a motorbike. 

My fashion sense is really ordinary.

I dont play, or am into sport. 

I really want a family one day. Being a dad would be amazing.

I have strong morals. Never understood how guys could sleep with many women - I always just wanted to find the right woman. Ive only slept with 4 women at 32.

I have a creative and adventurous streak. I like doing some things on a whim and seeing how the night pans out. My friends say I am usually late.

I am very easy going. Conflict stresses me out. I am not the best at debates, I can get too emotional.

In relationships, I can be too giving to the point it is smothering.

isfp,"Hi ISFP sub. So I am an ENTP. I have been being driven crazy by my ISFP sister lately. I hope I can get some advice. We are pretty close and can have a lot fun together, but she gets in this ‚Äúmode‚Äù a lot of days where she thinks that anything said or done by anyone is a constant attack against her. She takes everything personally, gets offended by everything, and constantly acts defensive. We are trapped in the house together 24/7 so we are constantly together.

She is emotionally reactive too, and lashes out whenever she feels threatened, which is all the time. God forbid I even say anything with a slightly different tone... she takes it as an attack against her. God forbid I make a harmless comment about any of her interests or lifestyle in any way... she takes it as an attack against her whole damn being.

I am not a super sensitive person like she is, and I understand that not everything that anyone says is about me or an attack towards me. I find her emotional overdramatic reactions to small things that I say to be VERY annoying. Here‚Äôs some examples of what I‚Äôm talking about:

- She will ask me to watch a tv show that she is obsessed with. I watch the whole show, and decide that I‚Äôm not a fan, so I tell her that I don‚Äôt like the tv show for this and that reason. She gets super offended, yelling at me that it‚Äôs annoying that I don‚Äôt like her tv show. She says that it feels like an attack against her own self when I don‚Äôt like things that she‚Äôs interested in.
- Sometimes, I will literally just be looking around the room and happen to look at her at in passing glance. If she ever catches me looking at her, she feels threatened. ‚ÄúWHY ARE YOU LOOKING AT ME?! WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT ME?!‚Äù I am constantly observing things, I‚Äôll look at her for like three seconds for no other reason than she‚Äôs in the room. She immediately takes it as, because I am looking at her EVER, I am thinking negatively of her.
- The mood swings... god the mood swings are just, awful. She also expects everyone around her to cater to her mood swings. During her bad moods, she wants the ability to lash out on everyone and everything because SHE feels bad. It‚Äôs always about how she feels. She‚Äôs also hypocritical in that she freaks out and cries/has a breakdown if anyone gives her a taste of her own medicine. Again, everything is about her feelings (Fi) so she doesn‚Äôt really care about how she‚Äôs affecting anyone else. Only about how people make her feel.

Me being an ENTP makes everything worse. I do not tolerant irrational emotional bullshit like this. When I‚Äôm not exhausted by her toxic energy, I call her out, because lashing out for no good reason is unacceptable and so disrespectful. I also need to have the freedom to state my opinions, and I am tired of constantly walking on eggshells around her. I even tone myself down A LOT around her because arguing with her always ends up with a completely illogical stream of bullshit comments on her end that don‚Äôt make any sense, and I try to avoid that whenever I can because it‚Äôs not worth my time. But, my toned down self is still not enough for her.

99% of the time too, my comments and irrelevant opinions aren‚Äôt even about HER. She just thinks that every other thing that I say is an attack against her, which most times, it isn‚Äôt!

Now, I do believe that my sister is an unhealthy ISFP. But, nevertheless, I do not know how to freaking navigate her Fi. If any ISFPs on here could help me to understand her, or give advice on how to deal with her, that‚Äôd be great.

So today I finally said to her; ""Listen about \*ISFP Friend\* I know your heart is in the right place. You don't like your friends being upset, but respectfully you need to back off. When she's feeling upset she needs space to calm down. When you start poking at her, that just gets her even more upset.

I do think our other friend does want to help. As I told her she does have her heart in the right place, but I think ISFP's in general might want their space when they're mad?",1596132182

I've done the test many times, and each time I seem to be something completely different depending on how the month has been going. I've had ISFJ, INFJ, INFP, ENFJ. Based on the subs, I actually relate to ISFP the most.

Some info to help- I want to be a teacher, and I consider myself good at making up games and being silly yet informative with kids. I think out of everything, that's my biggest talent. I love camping, paddle-boarding, knitting, cross-stitch, art, guitar, and a bunch of other fun and kind of creative things to do. None of that is my 'passion', but I'm more focused on the people in my life and having that as what I value the most. Not much of a 'hustler'. Also really interested in bugs and birds, I like to take photos of them and collect the pics with facts on them.

isfp,"For the past few months, I‚Äôve heard a lot of buzz surrounding the concept of dopamine detox and I thought to myself, does this thing actually work or is it just another one of Silicon Valley‚Äôs dubious trend?

We live in very stimulating times. With the growing popularity of social media, porn, and fast food, we‚Äôve reprogrammed our brain to fall for supernormal stimuli rather than normal or natural stimuli. It‚Äôs not that the normal stimuli aren‚Äôt rewarding, they‚Äôre just LESS rewarding than the artificial or supernormal stimuli.

A dopamine fast is the supposed antidote for the inattentiveness that plagues us, the burnout induced by too much of too many good things.

We are currently living in a technologically advanced era and as such, nothing is really believable unless backed by science and research. I explain the evidence and findings in more detail here: [https://youtu.be/q-STAF-zSrI](https://youtu.be/q-STAF-zSrI)",1596041122

&amp;#x200B;

Ichigo Kurosaki - This guy is probably the archetype for the ISFP. Everyone on this blue earth knows Ichigo, I've never seen this man mistyped by anyone ever just like L for INTP. ISFP is so obvious and such a perfect fit for Ichigo. He's chill and calm and lives by his Fi values and morality with things and everything he does. He lives day to day and fully lives in the moment with his Se and responds to details as they come to him with it too while focusing on fully today and that's it. He doesn't really know what he wants for the future from what I remember and he just lives for handling things today as they come and focuses on what he can understand and see right now. He helps a ghost girl and spirits that he sees in the beginning of the series and handles day to day things and follows his heart with everything he does. Once Rukia comes into play things get more interesting in his life and he at first is reluctant to all the strange things that's been happening the past day and trust his practical Se over any supernatural stuff and fighting a Hollow which seems crazy to him.He yells at Rukia and asks what's going on after he spontaneously beat the follow with his Se. She tells him and he rejects it, she gives her speech and forces him to be Soul Repear and his adventures start from here. I will admit, I a definitely an old school Bleach fan from back in the day, and I watched all the big 3 anime from One Piece, Naruto and Bleach so I definitely know the series but I admit I haven't watched the series in a long time so forgive me if I missed anything or said anything wrong factually from you Bleach fans out there, all of this is coming from memory as I watched it as a kid so be forgiving for any misremembered information on my part. So yeah, I think that's it and as much as I can talk about with Ichigo as a casual Bleach fan myself. I still like the series even though I'm not a huge fan myself and the series kind of fell off through the years, but I think its still a good series overall and it looks like its finishing from this date of me writing this of the anime coming back. But yeah, Ichigo the greatest ISFP of all time for sure.

Choji Akimichi - Where do I start with Choji and this amazing character here. So Choji is awesome, I think most people know this already. When you start off Naruto you might not think this but no actually he is a really awesome character and has a great relationship and friendship with Shikamaru in the series. Where do I begin, Choji is very inner value driven and cares a lot about his friends with his Fi. He lives in the moment and responds to details he sees in the moment and lives for today. Any type can like sensory pleasures like food, Luffy is ENFP and love meat for example but Choji does love food and eating in a very SP kind of way. He lives pretty in the moment with his Se and almost to a fault too as Asuma sensei tells him ""Choji, you need to stop eating and focus on your training!"" This saddens him greatly and he's forced to think about and looks down in regret and grief. He later listens though and tries to train a bit. This affects him greatly as we see him taking the sound ninja fights seriously and showing his progress as a ninja finally to us and his friends. He fights the sound ninja guy alone, and ends up using the food pills one by one to win at all costs. He takes the last big pill and turns into the great Butterfly Choji and gets his major badass moment in the fight and series here. Choji's Fi values and love for his friends shows through here, the guy badmouthing them and Shikamaru was the last straw and Choji's inner Fi isn't having any of it and he destroys him with each blow saying to him never say bad stuff about my best friend again. What more do I have to say, it's Choji, he's one of the best ISFPs of all time in anime history. You got to love his character he's amazing regardless if your a fan of him or not. He's not shown as much in Shippuuden but he's still shown enough to enjoy his character and dynamic still in the series.

Perona - Ok so onto Perona now. Perona is definitely ISFP, she's a really, really loud one! And extroverted introvert! But definitely ISFP for Perona for sure! And most people agree, Perona is driven by her inner values, deep emotions, and lives in the moment and responds to details as they come to her in the moment. She's very cutesy and cares a lot about cute things with her Fi, to the point of telling the Bearsy guy to stop talking because it isn't cute at all, her Fi is strong and even her Te inferior too. She's pretty bossy for a ISFP, her Te is definitely there but she's not the most efficient at the end of the day and toys with Usopp the whole fight against him with her inferior Te and Fi dom when she could have beat him at any point in time if she wanted. And we see her lack of Te confidence when she whines and screams when Usopp gets the upperhand and is about to shoot her and she pleads for her life and mercy and gets really sensitive and nice with her Fi and also with her running away from lack of Te inferior confidence when Usopp proves to be able to beat her and not be affected by the ghosts and causes her to run in fear and not face him head on at all with her Te inferior showing through here too. She's a bit selfish with her Fi and wants things to always go her way because she feels strongly about things and cares about her inner values and satisfaction with things with her Fi. She's a little spoiled and nags people all the time on what she wants and wants them to do for her too, she drives Zoro and Mihawk mad because of this behavior from here. Like a said a very loud ISFP with her and a strong extroverted side even though she's an introvert and ISFP definitely. Her Ni tertiary has her look at things behind the scenes sometimes and suspect what's actually going on like with going on the ship and loading cargo and with suspecting Kuma when he showed up as well. Overall she's great and amazing ISFP and awesome One Piece character, she's very popular and has an amazing power too with the ghosts and using them to sap the energy and drive out of people by lowering their self-esteem and causing them to be incapacitated and can't move basically as well. Love Perona, she'll always be one of my favorite One Piece characters and a lot of One Piece fans favorite too.

Perona is listed here by Fictionalcharactermbti, I agree with the list except for some like Juvia who is definitely an INFP and NF romantic idealist for sure:

James from Pokemon - Here's definitely the ultimate ISFP in anime too with James from Pokemon and Team Rocket. James is value driven with his Fi and has strong inner emotions about things and doesn't know how to express them very well. He's a bit shy at times and struggles to show what he truly means and feels at times to others too. He's kind of loving and caring for a villain and a bit romantic and loving in a ISFP way but not NF style way, just Fi dom in general way if that makes sense. He has family issues and doesn't want to face them immediately and brushes them under the rug and ran away from home. Eventually he has to deal with these troubles and emotions whether he wants to or not in one episode when I believe he sees his family again and the previous loved one her loved again. James lives in the moment and responds to details around him in the moment as well as they come to him. He's a bit impulsive and tries to respond to whatever works in the moment without planning or thinking ahead usually. He can be very unconfident at times with his low Te inferior and he has to build it up and try to be braver and more efficient than he is usually to get his goals done and be a more confident person as a whole in life and face his problems and issues head on more. James is awesome overall and one of the best ISFPs in anime for sure.Check out this James ISFP post down below:

James ISFP post, they did a good job with most of the Pokemon characters except Ash I disagree, Ash Ketchum is the ENFP stereotype and idealistic NF and future oriented dreamer for sure in my opinion along with other people too:

[https://mbtifiction.com/2015/09/24/james-pokemon-isfp/](https://mbtifiction.com/2015/09/24/james-pokemon-isfp/)

Kid Simon - One of the GOATs from Gurren Lagann and of the best ISFPs ever of all time. kid Simon is ISFP and Adult Simon is INFJ. But overall kid Simon is the face of Simon and the series for him on posters and everything. kid Simon is value driven and focuses on his inner values strongly and is very emotional and sensitive inside and struggles to show his Fi emotions a lot too. He's very grounded and in the moment with his Se and responds to details around him easily with his Se as well. His ter Ni can looks behind the scenes and come up with a plan when necessary as well like when Kamina believed in him. He Te inferior makes him not confident and efficient and has his struggle to take charge in situations with his Te inferior. Simon gains confidence eventually in comes into his own and becomes a great leader eventually. He beats the Spiral King and saves the world temporarily until the Anti-Spirals come in the future. In the future Simon changes into an INFJ and changes personality completely. He uses his Ni more dominantly and changes into a Fe user for it as Fe aux with him. He becomes future oriented with his Ni and user Ti detail analysis and struggles to live in the moment with his Se inferior as an adult and INFJ then. But Kid Simon is definitely ISFP so I definitely had to put him here no doubt. One of the best of all time, love Simon and always will.

Shirahoshi - A clear Fi dom with Shirahoshi here and Se aux too. Shirahoshi is sensitive and emotions with her Fi sensitivity to things and is very inner value based and lives by her inner emotions and values to a large degree. She lives fully in the moment with her Se and reacts and responds to details fully in the moment as they come. She does still have goals she wants to do though with her Ni ter like going to the Sea Forest because of her mother and wanting to see the outside world and what its like too. Her Te inferior is clear since she is always unconfident and struggles with efficiency and doesn't want to go outside because of lack of courage and low Te inferior in her and she always cries a lot and is hurt easily emotionally with her Fi dom sensitivity again being affected by every little thing Luffy says, which causes Luffy to give her the Weepyhoshi name and stereotype. Overall she builds confidence and goes and leaves the palace with her inferior Te and gets things done when she can. She's becoming a very important character in the story and her role is very important as Mermaid Princess and more of course I'll say without spoiling anything for anyone that hasn't seen One Piece yet. She's a great character despite what people say and has a big impact on the story of One Piece as people know already with her character and importance to the story as One Piece fans already know what I'm talking about here. Great character and a really great ISFP too.

Link from Legend of Zelda - One of the best ISFPs of all time in gaming history of course with Link from the Zelda games. Link is very Fi value driven and is a true hero at heart and lives by his own inner values and not by society's values at all with Fe. Fi inner values is everything to Link and in games like Ocarina of Time we see how sensitive he is with his Fi and how he can struggle with confidence and efficiency with his Te inferior too. Despite this Link is a trucker and go getter who gets up when he's brave enough and does some of the bravest things in gaming history, while fighting some of the toughest monsters around. His Se is very useful for him using auxillary, he responds to details fully in the moment very quickly and is very hands on with having a lot of tools and gadgets he comes across in the series and franchise. Link can manage and handling any tool or utility and item he receives and spontaneously learns how to use it effectively on the spot. Reacting to details in the moment with his Se and being so good with any tool or new weapon he gains and comes across has always been evidence with link, he's definitely a Se user and is very hands on and spontaneous with his Se and reaction to details and handling tools and weapons against bosses and during tough situations to solve puzzles at a moments notice on the spot in moment at anytime in the series and games he's in. It's Link, he's one of the GOAT ISFPs for sure. Check it this great ISFP Link post down below:

Roxas from Kingdom Hearts - Roxas from Kingdom Hearts is definitely ISFP, he's not INFP definitely a Se aux user with him. Roxas is a Fi dom and is very inner value driven with his Fi. He's very sensitive and emotional but fails and struggles to express his inner deep Fi emotions in situations. His Se has him live fully in the moment and respond to details as they come to him in the moment today. He doesn't think about the future very much at all and would much rather focus on things going on day to day. Sometimes he gets Ni hunches about things and goes after them on what he's thinking about or sees and is suspecting behind the scenes that he feels his Ni ter hunch will tell him a secret about or answer to something strange that's going on, this all happens constantly in the fake Twilight Town with him and the nobodies. He struggles with Te confidence a lot of the time and efficiency and gets hung up on his Fi dom emotions, but when he's angry he gives into his Fi rage and Te inferior, and it all comes out and makes him charge in and get headstrong out of nowwhere and face people and situations like fighting Seifer in the tournament and beating him once and for all. He's very impulsive with his Se and when his Fi gets angry about things and towards people and others, he jump right into things with his Se without thinking of a second thought or the future at all while raging fully in the moment as a Se aux user and emotionally Fi dom too which is his whole entire character the whole franchise of Kingdom Hearts, emotionally responding to things he can't understand with his Fi and Se impulsiveness and anger towards everything and everyone he's mad at all the time and things he can't understand at all to him. Roxas is very sensitive with his Fi and inner emotions he struggles to express, it drives his whole character in KH 2 and 358/2 days. His emotions are strong and he's very empathetic and emotional person, what more do I have to say Fi is Roxas's character and Se is a major part of him to with responding to details in the moment and live life day by day and not understanding what's going on with his life and everything and always being confused on complex and abstract matters with his pratical and down to earth Se and not knowing how to handle it with his sensitive Fi dom emotions as well too. Roxas is Roxas, one of the best ISFPs ever in my opinion and many other people as well, amazing character and very well written in general too I truly believe. Check out this amazing Roxas ISFP post down below:

Zuko from Avatar the Last Airbender - Zuko is one of the most stereotypical ISFPs of all time. He's very emotional and follows his inner values to a large degree. He struggles to follow his own way and figure out what's right in the world and what right and wrong are anymore to him with the decisions he makes in life. He responds to details in the moment, is about action, and is very impulsive with his Se. Sometimes he makes the wrong decision with his Se and sometimes he makes the right one. He misses the obvious and truth sometimes and struggles a lot with hidden meaning with things and doesn't understand wisdom and needs constant guidance and answers in life with his down to earth Se and Fi inner values needed assurance which his INFP uncle Iroh does a good job filling the void in with him. Zuko is definitely ISFP, he lives by his inner values and struggles with his sensitive and confused inner emotions and can't express himself very well and struggles to be efficient and even confident with decisions sometimes with his Te inferior. His Fi explodes all the time with things and Se impulsive in the moment rages as well. He lives fully in the moment with his Se and lives life responding to details day to day and struggles to think or figure out what's going to happen in the future all the time. When he's not caught in grips with his in the moment Se or emotion Fi he can be future oriented sometimes with his Ni ter and gets hunches about things and suspects things behind the scenes with his Ni ter as well. But overall he lives fully in the moment today and responds quickly to details in the moment with his Se aux and is very sensitive and has complex and confused Fi emotions that he struggles to express constantly in the series. He tries to train his Te inferior and get goals and jobs done and work toward his goal with find the Avatar with his Ni and Te and staying focused on the goal as efficiently as he can even though he struggles with his Te inferior a lot in the series. Zuku is one of the best ISFPs out there and definitely deserves the popularity he gets for his amazing character as a villain, anti hero, and eventual hero too and redemption story he has. Here's an excellent Zuko ISFP post down below talking about him in depth:

Stain - I had trouble on Stain in the past, but people online convinced me on ISFP and it makes sense. Stain is definitely very value driven and definitely has Fi in him for sure. His inner values are everything to him no doubt for sure, he's definitely an Fi dom. He does live in the moment though it seems and responds to details in the moment apparently with his Se aux. He's impulsive and doesn't plan much at all for the future. He just goes from city to city killing people and doesn't have a clear goal or method of enacting his dream of getting back at heroes and finding someone worth of being a true hero out here amoung all the fakes in his eyes. ISFP makes a lot of sense for Stain, so yeah. I'm fine with that and fully alright with putting him on here on this list.

Deidara - He is definitely ISFP and Fi dom here for sure. He fits the ISFP artist stereotype and definitely a Fi dom who lives by his inner values and artistic prowess and values toward artistic creations and things with his clay power he has. His Se helps him see details and react to details in the moment and sculpt clay models at will with great detail and accuracy of creation of the dolls in the moment with his Se. Definitely ISFP for Deidara for sure, check out this ISFP post on him down below:

I type Hidan ESTP, and I think Kabuto is ISTJ but Deidara is ISFP for sure here:

isfp,"Wondering if this is relatable for other ISFPs. I prefer to listen to upbeat high energy songs without deep meaning. I mostly avoid sad songs because they put me in a whole mood and can get me stuck in my head. 

This is likely relatable for other types as well tbh though",1595965083
isfp,"So I'm pretty positive I'm an ISFP 4, but I've definitely had some people say I'm an INFP.  I was thinking about the things that I related to in the descriptions and wanted to make a post for everyone here to see if anyone can relate to these thought processes or if this seems like a pretty good post describing our (ISFP) thought process.

I feel that as ISFP‚Äôs we have such a special ability of understanding ourselves and understanding the depths of human emotion and human struggle. We have such a strong moral system and we just seem to naturally be in tune with what‚Äôs the right thing to do, who‚Äôs the right person to hang around with and our values really make us who we are but also kind of distance ourselves from others who don‚Äôt share that same thought process. 

We‚Äôre dreamers yet we‚Äôre also realistic. I‚Äôve been described as spaced out and dreamy but I‚Äôve also been described as having a down to earth and realistic thought process. I think that ISFP‚Äôs can use Ni in a very strong way, we can definitely be smart in school, and understand abstract concepts, but here‚Äôs my thing: I‚Äôm good at school and piecing together abstract concepts but I much prefer living in the moment and having fun. I wouldn‚Äôt visit an art museum but go on a surfing adventure, that‚Äôs what life is about to me. I‚Äôm not concerned with the idea or history behind a vacation, I‚Äôm concerned with what fun and adrenaline we‚Äôll be experiencing on the vacation. It‚Äôs such an interesting mix for us, me and plenty of other ISFP‚Äôs I‚Äôve known have shared this laid back ability to have fun doing an activity yet also deeply understand a concept or analogy. I‚Äôm actually a writer and always have been, I used to enjoy writing short stories and I‚Äôve noticed that all of them consist of a realistic setting and I didn‚Äôt delve into any fantasy lands or alien planet type of things. I could very well be an INFP but I don‚Äôt relate to the whimsical or completely fantasy prone traits.

We‚Äôre so good at sensing the emotional atmosphere and we‚Äôre very good at reading people. I think that Se and Ni combination comes in handy. Sometimes I notice that I‚Äôm able to notice very specific expressions and body language that help me get the ‚Äòvibe‚Äô of someone. I‚Äôm really, really sensitive to my atmospheres and I‚Äôm very in tune with sensory information. I have had difficulty in boring and cramped up ugly classrooms that had a weird smell to it, but once I was outside and in the park, I would instantly feel rejuvenated. I need to feel connected with the earth in a way. I could drive for hours down a country road enjoying the speed of the car and seeing my surroundings. I love to skateboard and play music while doing so, it makes me feel that I‚Äôm exploring what‚Äôs around me. I need a balance between my mind and body. I can also be vain and concerned with my body image.

I hate when my emotions or situations are compared to others or are reduced to a category. I believe that humans feel a huge depth of emotion and that our experiences and emotions are so drastically separate from each other that we shouldn‚Äôt have to feel that we‚Äôre always being categorized or told what to feel. We‚Äôre really good at empathizing but we‚Äôll never say: ‚ÄòYou should feel this way‚Äô. ‚ÄòI felt this way about that so you should too.‚Äô ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs not proper for you to feel this way.‚Äô  We‚Äôre good at kind of just letting people pour their souls and understanding that even if we can‚Äôt ever directly feel what they feel, we value people‚Äôs emotional independence that it kind of helps us process their feelings. 

We‚Äôre sometimes very unintentionally individualistic. We need to think and feel independently, we don‚Äôt really allow expectations or social rules to prevent us from understanding a perspective and it certainly doesn‚Äôt stop us from going against the norm especially when it‚Äôs a personal value. We set our own boundaries, connect with who we want to, and can choose who to act more outgoing with and who to be aloof with. It‚Äôs different from other types because we don‚Äôt naturally feel compelled to fit in, we just want to find people who fit in with us. That being said I find that while some ISFP‚Äôs can be edgy and dark, a lot of us tend to seem very sweet on the outside. We typically have interesting fashion choices, I love wearing Fedora‚Äôs and leather jackets, while another iSFP dyes her hair and wears comfortable but still colorful and aesthetic shirts. 

The Fi-Ni loop sucks. From my recollection of one I remember it feeling like I was constantly trapped in my emotional states and my situation. I didn‚Äôt like the people I was around and I didn‚Äôt like the setting I was in, so I‚Äôd withdraw into my emotions and envision a future where I‚Äôd feel better. I would get pretty engrossed into an imaginary setting or vision that I wanted to happen. It feels like being trapped in your mind and into a imaginary plane because the present moment and your surroundings are giving you discomfort.

This can be the opposite, sometimes my Ni traps me into a vision of a terrifying future, where a singular negative event is fated and destined to happen and there‚Äôs nothing that I can do about it.  Judging by my personal experience and also the experience of other ISFP‚Äôs I‚Äôve known, I feel that we get attached to people we hold dear very closely. I used to think that was a sign of Tertiary Si, but it‚Äôs not that we‚Äôre constantly stuck in the past, but it‚Äôs that when we bring someone in, we hold them close to us making it difficult to let go.  I feel like the nostalgia thing always through me off guard, I love old songs that invoke feelings or memories of certain friends, but I typically score very low on Si.",1595956458
isfp,"Hi! How are you all doing! Firstly I just needed to say that I adoooore you ISFPs :)

[This is a pretty long text, so if you don't want to read all of this just skip to the *** part]

So, I've been best friends with this person for 12 years now and apart from all this years of friendship *I still can't recognize her MBTI :(* 
It keeps me really frustrated but I've only started learning about MBTI last year, so... If someone could help me recognizing her type I would be really grateful &lt;3

I'm almost sure she's an ISFP, mainly because of the type's letters (I, s, f, p), but as I'm still learning about cognitive functions, the best way to recognize someone's type, I really can't be sure about my observations. The thing is that I've read a lot about ISFPs and the description I've found matches my friend's personality (she thinks that some things match, but not all), but she really doesn't act like the famous ISFPs or the ones in movies (the only ones I know).

- She's already taken the 16p test and her result was ESFJ, but I know this result is completely wrongüòÇüòÇüòÇ I'm still convincing her to do the cognitive functions test but she always refuses to do it because it's long! And a fun fact is that in random personality tests like ""what character would you be in..."" she almost always gets the I*TJs, but I don't think these types match her own personality at all.

***Some things about her:
1 - she's really shy at first but when you really get to know her she's THE FUNNIEST PERSON IN THE WORLD; her sense of humor is really sarcastic and random, it seems to come naturally to her
2 - she's really into aesthetics, her internet accounts are all meticulously organized to match with her own aesthetic too
3 - she's always loved drawing, she does it with such naturalness! She could spend her whole life watching anime and drawing, really
4 - she loves animals, as if her soul was connected to them
5 - she's *really* chill, it seems like nothing stresses her out 
6 - she always cries in movies, but I almost never see her crying about daily experiences. Her real emotions are hard to recognize, really, and that's why I'm not sure if she would really have a dominant Fi. 
7 - as a child she had a problem making friends as she was """"unique"""", had different interest from most kids, and suffered a lot of bullying from that
8 - she's really bad at supporting people hehehe in some situations where I needed her help I knew she cared about me, but she just didn't know how to help me
9 - she acts like if sponge Bob and squidward tentacle had a daughter, if this makes any sense (she's all funny and goofy but can be really serious and sarcastic in her ""exterior"")
10 - I'm an ENFP an we magically understand eachother, she makes me act **completely** goofy somehow, it's like if she could intensify my own personalityüòÇüòÇ

isfp,"I feel like everyone has that one thing. 

For me it's always been coding. In high school I always was done with projects faster than anyone else, I got so far ahead the teacher stopping giving me the next assignment or else I would leave everyone too far behind (I spent my time helping other people). I never studied for any test and even failed one project since I didn't run it before I turned it in (and still got an A).

I didn't take more than two classes in coding in high school but in college I used to help my CS major roommates with their research projects (and they were no slouch, one got a full ride for academics).

Nothing was easier for me in life. I can confidently say that if I studied computer science in college, I would probably be working in Google right now.

I've got pretty much the other functions figured out, but Fi and Fe especially inferior are confusing me. As a Fi-dom (even an unseelie one? and I'm actually not even sure what it means and if it's an actual thing, because that was the first time I came across seelie/unseelie) shouldn't I at least hold some strong values..? rather than overwrite everything with what is logical or objective truths rather than what is true to me? what are some tell tale signs that someone is definitely Fi rather than Fe? I've tried functions tests but they wary so much in results that it's hopeless. I thought I was an introspective person, but I don't think I've actually introspected with my deeper feelings, more trying to figure out what impact they had on me, my actions and my body and my reactions in a hmm piecing-a-puzzle kinda way...

When I woke up this morning and found my bf‚Äôs turtle completely unresponsive, I woke hip up immediately. My bf never acted as if he felt the slightest bit of sadness or anything, and simply said, ‚Äúit was his time‚Äù.  We continued to discuss the different ways so dispose of the body but while potentially keeping the shell as a keepsake. At one point he watched a YouTube video and ALMOST took a knife to the turtle to cut his body out of the shell! Apparently it‚Äôs not uncommon, but after some thinking we decided to bury him. Yes, this was a weird day. 

I‚Äôm sitting here basically in tears most of the time because I know what I would feel like after losing a pet after 20 years of bonding and caring for it. Meanwhile, he is approaching it so much more controlled and almost robotic.

isfp,"I'm an infp who recently ended things with an isfp with mad commitment issues. Basically it started off as just sex, morphed into a relationship, I fell in love (obviously, that's what infps do) but never told him. After 6 months I was letting my feelings slip out a bit and hit me up with the 'I'm so busy, can we see each other less' line. I'd said I'd think about it but 2 days later he'd been using tinder so I ended things. I didn't want to so it kinda feels like he broke up with me. 

The thing is he kept on texting me and stuff after we'd ended as if we were still together. I had a moment where he didn't text me back for a few hours at night and kinda assumed he was on a date. Being very in the moment he would never check his phone when he was out but he was always very responsive to me.

I text him basically asking how his date went, he denied it was a date but in that moment I'd realised I'd gone a bit nuts thinking he's keeping me strung along whilst dating other people. I ended the friendship via text basically. Told him I needed space to move on and I couldn't do that whilst we were still acting like a couple. 

We didn't text each other for a few days but then I cracked and text him. I asked him if he still wanted to continue the friendship via text for now and he said he 'would like to keep the friendship going'

Thing is, he's never text me first since but always replies when I text him and I don't know if he's just being nice by replying or whether he genuinely is annoyed by me texting him. Maybe he's just giving me the space I'd asked for. 

As much as I have a deep love for him, I know the relationship side doesn't really work for either of us but he's a really good friend and I would like to keep that.

\------

This was my description for the poll (don't attack me. it's something i genuinely struggle with and am trying to fix):

When a semi attractive person acts kind of nice to me one time, I romanticize it until I fall in love with the idealized version of them in my own mind and not actually who they are in real life. Then I get to know them more and after I fall ""out of love"", I cringe and I'm like - why did I ever like this person? I must have been insane. And it was because I had fallen in love with the idea of someone they could be that they actually weren't but I was just blinded by my romanticized view of them to see the reality of who they were.

It happens to me so often that for almost all of my past ""crushes"", I'm cringing and thinking to myself - how could I have ever liked this person?

 I just thought I'd post the same poll for ISFPs because I'm curious how much the results could differ/be similar. I'm also going to post this poll to the other subreddits for the other types. Genuinely curious! Thanks!

I recently got a job offer as Sales Manager because of my background in sales. And guess what, my performance was mediocre. I was in sales for only a year because it was draining for an ISFP with all the field work and clients you need to talk to. 

I took the job offer anyway in a desperate plea to finally land a job, especially a managerial position. Mind you, looking for a job these days, esp in my country, is really hard. I‚Äôve been trying for months. Those that I like are at a wayyy lower pay grade than my recent job, and I didn‚Äôt want to settle for much less. Getting this after monthsss of applying is already a blessing. 

I‚Äôve never led a large team before, let alone a team that would rely on you to hit sales targets.

isfp,"I‚Äôve been feeling like I was hitting a wall with my productivity and development until I recently came across this wonderfully simple concept called the 5 Hour Rule. No matter how busy successful people are, they always spend at least an hour a day ‚Äî or five hours a work week ‚Äî learning or practicing. And they do this across their entire career.

The 5 Hour Rule has been traced all the way back to Benjamin Franklin, who was constantly setting aside time to learn each day. It‚Äôs also been embraced by several leaders like Bill Gates, Warren Buffett and Oprah.

The rule has been broken down into 3 buckets that learning takes place through:

* Reading: Investing in a reading habit can, expectedly, help you grow each and every day
* Reflection: Taking the time to assess what you‚Äôve learnt and how you can get better will set you up for success in the future
* Experimentation: Experiments show you what‚Äôs working and where you need to improve.

I highly recommend you try this out. I explain this further here - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7071k1J0O0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7071k1J0O0)

But when it comes to stuff like politics/religion, I won‚Äôt engage, even though I have a strong belief system, I know it will just open up a can of worms because people typically people want to assert their opinions and not open their minds to another perspective and hear someone else, so it creates conflict and I try to avoid conflict as much as possible.

In relationships I value someone who can respect my feelings and not see me as emotional.

Tonight though he told me he felt like we were going to run out of topics to discuss and that conversation would run dry. He told me that the things he talked about with me were ""projects"" he arranged for us to talk about together. This was a shock to me because I thought he was just casually talking to me and the topics we discussed were organically occuring not topics that he'd planned that we can talk about. I didn't know he was exerting effort into talking to me because I certainly wasn't. It hurt my feelings. 

He says we should try to get into DND to have more to talk about like a shared Interest to discuss. He said maybe he's just more complicated than me and needs more stimulus from friendships to keep it interesting. Mean while I never felt like there was something wrong with our friendship and that it needed to be improved. That also hurt my feelings because it's like he's saying he's more complex than me. 

I'm hurt and Now I feel like whenever I talk to him it's just going to be some topic he arranged to talk to me about and that I'm under stimulating him. Also I don't know that I want to take up a new hobby right now and put effort and time into that. 

With my fellow ISFP friend I can happily talk to him about basically nothing for hours. I pretty much thought I was doing that with my ENTP friend but apparently not.

Also I'm feeling like I'm just providing entertainment to him now and that he doesn't actually care about me as much as I care about him and that if the friendship died he would just be fine. Meanwhile I'm over here loving the shit out of him and caring about him so fucking much.

Edit: my friend said that he literally just wanted to play DND with me and there's not some secret scheme that he doesn't find me fun. He said he likes talking to me otherwise he wouldnt. He just wants some activity that we can do together he said he was tired and he worded it wrong. So we left it at that and I guess I'm going to try DND now.",1595301203
isfp,"Hello reddit, I‚Äôm an INFP in my early 20‚Äôs and I recently began talking to an ISFP girl from my town. We met on Tinder and have been snapchatting everyday for months. We‚Äôve hung out one time and I thought it went really well, we seemed to get along great.

About a month ago she moved back with her friends in their apartment a town over from where we‚Äôre from (she was home cuz COVID). Ever since then I‚Äôve been getting a lot of mixed signals from her.

Essentially, I get the vibe that she‚Äôs ‚Äúbored‚Äù of me. Initially we would talk for hours about whatever the heck, and when we were hanging out in person, she seemed very engaged with me. But I almost feel as though I‚Äôm bothering her sometimes when I talk to her.

I expected us to talk a little less now that she‚Äôs with her friends again, I get it. I would probably be the same way lol. But it‚Äôs mostly her demeanor when we ARE talking. I just feel as though she‚Äôs losing interest. But then at the same time, she‚Äôs always the first one to snapchat me everyday, certain days its clear she wants to talk, then the next day she sends one snap and leaves me on read, then another day she is clearly bored of me, its just unpredictable haha. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I like this girl because I feel like we‚Äôre similar in a lot of ways, but sometimes I just feel too ‚Äúweird‚Äù for her, like we‚Äôre speaking a different language but we can understand eachother? Its strange. 

Can you ISFPs tell me if you relate to her behavior? What should I do? Thank you :)",1595276839
isfp,"Hi guys.. I‚Äôm feeling a bit stuck and would like to hear a different perspective perhaps. 

My dreams are to write (fiction, music, ..) but I‚Äôm in a country where STEM education was heavily emphasised since young. I never let me self pursue these creative hobbies because it feels even shameful or dumb to mention I want to be a writer to anyone. I went through crippling stress and just not enough time to find myself and explore as a young person but the most damaging thing was really telling myself I must be this way and do these or else I‚Äôm stupid and unsuccessful and doing something wrong. It really sucks and I just really feel like my personality and abilities are not appreciated...  
Otherwise, I‚Äôm a pretty flexible person and I enjoy learning new things and wouldn‚Äôt mind doing any job. 

But I know my passion is writing and if I feel like I can‚Äôt do it I just feel really upset about it. To a point I hated myself for being this ‚Äòintense‚Äô and ‚Äòweird‚Äô when I can change myself at any moment and just become a regular istj (just not think so hard and do what I‚Äôm supposed to) or something and fit into society. But I really cherish the way I think and hope that I can create works that society (or at least whoever consumes my stuff) can benefit from, so I persevere on my goals. 

I feel like I‚Äôm jumping through hoops sometimes, to find a job that could give me a stable income, perhaps remote, also right now I‚Äôm investing a lot of effort into my part time job so I can give myself enough time that I desperately need for my creative pursuits. 

I don‚Äôt know, maybe I‚Äôm being too entitled. Or I just needed a rant, these feelings have been simmering all my life and didn‚Äôt just come out from 1 year of post graduation life trying to job hunt.

isfp,"ISFP here.

So when I read the book I immediately related to her and understood the logic behind her actions. I actually never found any other character this much relatable. 

I see most websites typing her as INTJ or ISTP. 

But most of her actions were usually based on her personal values or how she felt at the moment. Even the other characters in the book tell her that she doesnt act logical. Her actions did turn out to make a difference but she almost never planned ahead. Like the time she put flowers on Rue's body or when she threw the arrow towards Gamemakers. Those were pretty risky and she only did it with the urge of the moment or that it felt right.

I might be wrong so I'm open to new perspectives. What do you guys think?",1595258494

isfp,"It's pretty common knowledge that in order to get out of the loop, you need to use your second function. Most of the advice I've seen online hasn't helped me personally, until I recently realized something that has actually been working:

Find an Se activity that will *speak* to your Fi. Honestly, walking out in nature will probably not work if you‚Äôre in the loop. The whole point of my Fi-Ni loop is that I've practically lost my ability to live in the moment. So the entire time I'm out in nature, I'd just be daydreaming about millions of future possibilities of how things might turn out (that Ni is crazy man). The trees around me and the beautiful smell of the flowers aren't giving me any workable information to get through my loop. I mean, even though being in nature might help a little bit while you‚Äôre out there, the long-term positive effects are practically non-existent. Instead, try finding an Se activity that will *stimulate your Fi*. This will be different for every person, since Fi is subjective. You need to find what works for *your* Fi. 

Try finding something that's easily accessible and doable. 

For example, watching an interesting TV show might help since your Se will be activated for your Fi. Taking lessons from the characters &amp; seeing how they‚Äôre dealing with their problems while having your Se stimulated by the aesthetic scenes and awesome sound tracks could help out. But if you‚Äôre like me, you may be too lazy to browse through Netflix until you finally find something that sounds mildly interesting for the Fi. I personally enjoy reading non-fiction books about psychology. I also enjoy meditating and journaling. The point is to find an Se activity that actually speaks to your Fi and adds meaning to it. There has to be that *mental stimulation* that comes with the Se. And only *you* can figure out what that activity will be.",1595192489

isfp,"My son is 7 years old, and thought for a while that he is an ISFJ, but lately I have been having my doubts. I suspect him of being a Fi user mistaken for Fe, and I think ISFP fits the bill.

My son is first and foremost a sensitive and physically active child. He is generally a happy child with mood swings. The mood swings depends very much on how his Interactions with the world is at the moment. It is not hard to get him to laugh, but boy can he get in a foul mood if something did not go as he planned to. It can be anything, like losing in a game, the episode of his tv series was boring and his alloted TV time is over, his friends playing by a different rule than what he wants. Complaining and sometimes yelling is often the result. Sometimes the foul mood persists and something totally unrelated gets to feel his thorn. At the same time he is a very sweet child who absolutely loves his parents and closest friends, and is often struck by bad conscience if he thinks he made someone sad. He is sometimes very self centered, and sometimes very concerned about those he loves. He is kind of all over the place.

All over the place is how I would describe his interests. He loves physical activities and often excels in them. Sports is his favorite subject in school, but he is not so interested in organized activities. Probably because it takes to light heartedness out of it. He doesn't need to be the best as long as he is above average. At the same time he loves to read. He can immerse himself completely in a book, and read for long periods of time. He can also be lost in thoughts, seemingly quite far away and unresponsive when we talk to him. Then he can suddenly stop his introspection and start talking about everything and anything, without any break! Sometimes I need to tell him to entertain himself for a moment because my ears get overloaded! He really likes to talk about his interests and his own thoughts, but only when he is in the mood. When I ask him to tell me about his day, I am met with silence, lol. His favorite activity goes in cycles, and he goes to the next one when he is bored by the current one.
He loves learning about nature and how stuff work. He has a book about insects (which he loves), and we often go outside to discover the insects he just read about. He tends to pick up interesting or shiny things he finds outside, especially feathers. I sometimes have to tell him he can't drag home every piece of junk he finds.

He is often distracted. Getting him to school in the morning is sometimes a challenge, because he has no concept of time. Oh, he understands time, but it is of secondary importance. When I say he has to hurry, he still thinks he has time to read a couple of pages in his comic. He does his homework though. After finishing the homework late in the evening for the 100th time, he finally found out that it sucks and he now does all homework right after school. He just needed a bit of motivation. When he is motivated, he finishes his homework in zero time. He has no learning issues, and is an above average pupil. 

He can be a bit timid when meeting new people, but when he warms up to them he can show his true enthusiasm. He has several friends who enjoy playing with hin which I think is a miracle considering his volatile nature. He does tend to display his good side, and when he has fun he often squeels from joy. What gets him really riled up is if someone attributes him a behavior which is untrue, like lying, being afraid when he is not. My son is a very honest person, and dishonesty is probably the thing he hates the most. He is ready to compromise when deciding what to play, but he gets angry if there isn't a balance between his and his friends preferences. He dislike being bossed around, and prefers when there is mutual respect. 

Oh, I forgot. For someone who can sometimes be oblivious to his surroundings, he can be incredible observant. He has several times reminded me of something which I have forgotten (curse that inferior Se). He often recalls stuff which I have discussed with my wife, when we thought he did not pay attention. Yeah, he always pay attention when he shouldn't and vice versa.",1594924154

So I graduated last summer and have been working as a web-dev for a few months.

I've been having mixed feelings about if this is the right job for me. Don't get me wrong, there's plenty of things I like about it. But there's also things that don't really reasonate with me as a person.

Here's a few pro's and con's:

Pros:

* Flexible hours
* Being able to build something and design something (can be pretty fun)
* Being able to work from home. Makes me feel less stuck in a box (also a con)

Cons:

* It can get really repetetive
* Sometimes I do miss social contact and the human aspect
* I can get really stressed if I'm not being productive (ISFP procrastinators what's up)
* At the end of the day I work from home, but it still feels like I'm stuck in an office
* Sometimes I feel like I'm not living my best life doing this

Computer science was just something I was always good at, but it's never really been my passion. I'm a passionate photographer and videographer. But I can't pay my bills with that. So I'm a web-dev.

Don't get me wrong, I do enjoy it. But I just sometimes wonder if this is the best thing for me.

isfp,"Im 19M INFP and have liked a 20F ISFP for a while. And I know for a fact that she likes me too. In the past we have went on dates, were/still are (unspoken) mutually exclusive, our friend group all knows and we are very comfortable being ‚Äútogether‚Äù around everyone.

She has always been unsure on whether or not she is ready for a relationship and wanted to take things slowly. I also wanted to take things slowly and match her pace. I don‚Äôt want to make this too long so basically there has always been this dynamic of ‚ÄúIm not sure if we should be in a relationship‚Äù She is very worried about how her life can change with that seriousness and commitment and it really gets to her head. There have been moments where she said we shouldn‚Äôt be together which I always respect, but then inevitably something develops again.

It‚Äôs been now around 8 months and I have grown increasingly more concerned that this issue with commitment is something that is overwhelming for her to deal with and not sure how much has changed. And with our current life situations, the clock is somewhat ticking with this summer being the last really opportune time for anything to happen. And she knows that and friends have mentioned that to her, and it overwhelms her to think about it.

I‚Äôm not really sure what to do. I really want things to work out, and I have until recently thought she was unsure bc she didn‚Äôt know if she completely liked me, so I have tried to not think about her as much as I can and just focus on myself and making improvements in my life, which I am continuing to do. But now it seems different. And my gut reaction is to give her time and space to figure things out. But it hurts me to see her dealing with all these emotions, and I don‚Äôt want to sit idly by while this summer passes.

isfp,"I‚Äôve had a hard time learning new things. Concepts often seem to go over my head and I rarely ever recall what I thought I learnt. Over time, I realized that it was because I never truly understood what I was learning.

The Feynman technique is particularly effective at helping you master difficult concepts. Named after the Nobel Prize winning Richard Feynman, the concept focuses on explaining a difficult concept in easy to understand language as if you were explaining it to someone else (or a child). By following the Feynman technique, you might just end up learning difficult concepts quickly, spend less time studying, and remember concepts longer.

The four steps are as follows:

1. Write the concept down
2. Explain it using simple language
3. Address (look up) problematic areas or questions that remain
4. Challenge yourself to simplify it further

I have found this to be a powerful concept that helps you cut study time shortly. The push to understand and explain a concept forces you to identify areas where you have a gap in your understanding. I‚Äôve broken this down even further here - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RleSyp16lLE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RleSyp16lLE).

isfp,"I suffer from a bipolar disorder, which causes my moods to change very drastically. Sometimes it's hard to see how much of my behavior get's influenced by the disorder and how much is just my personality.

I know it can be different for everybody, but just to reflect a little with other ISFP's is huge for me. How would you guys relate to these situations for example? 

1. I come from a household of Thinking/Judging types of personalities, so I grew up getting a lot of pushback on pretty much all my ideas. Always being told that my way of seeing things was wrong, kind of traumatized me. I feel super uncomfortable around them now, and would be OK seeing/talking to them once a year tops. I am not sure if this is just an extreme feeling caused by the disorder or that it fits the personality. 

2. I constantly dream of living in foreign countries and I feel like my current situation is always 'temporary'. The idea of buying a house and sticking to a stable job is a total nightmare for me. The disorder amplifies this and makes me feel like I will blow my brains out if I settle down. Being able to fit all my belongings in a couple of suitcases feels amazing. 

3. There is a weird mix where I like traveling and am super curious for new experiences, yet when I like something I stick to it. Up to an extreme with food (I eat the exact same breakfast and lunch every day) and social activities (the same creative outlets with my favorite people? Sign me up). The disorder can be easily triggered, so it could be that I like predictable routines to limit that risk. 

I hope I don't make anybody uncomfortable talking about a mental illness. If you are curious about a mood disorder, feel free to ask anything you want. Not a native speaker, sorry for wrong grammar.",1594420222

isfp,"It‚Äôs not just Reddit, I notice this in real life too, but not nearly as much because I think ISFPs communicate effectively in person but...

Do you notice that your jokes are so subtle or self-deprecating that people just think you‚Äôre dumb or seeking validation? I was thinking about this yesterday when I saw a chart of personality types‚Äô styles of humor.

I see this trend where I‚Äôll leave an ironic comment on a Reddit post and then later some presumptuous INFJ or INTP type will comment after me, basically explaining my joke and then using my original comment as the punchline. In other words, they (ironically) presumed they were so much smarter than me that THEY had to explain to ME and everyone else why what I said was funny.

And the crazy thing is they‚Äôll get a bazillion upvotes for making me the butt of my own joke while I will get small acknowledgement for the set-up, at best. üòÇüôÑ

It makes me think most people on Reddit are socially awkward or autistic or something.

In real life, it‚Äôs the Fe types who don‚Äôt get my humor. They‚Äôll perceive a self-deprecating joke as a cry for help and rush to comfort, instead of laughing..which kills the vibe. üôÑ 

Or if the joke is focused on something or someone else, they‚Äôll find it mean, inappropriate, distasteful, etc.

Sometimes I see them in here saying their ISFP said ‚Äúsomething hurtful‚Äù to them and when I read what their SO said, I burst out laughing bc it‚Äôs obviously a joke, and usually a good one. To me anyway. 

TL;DR: our humor is an acquired taste",1594387484

I've been spending time with family recently after not seeing them much before and something dawned on me.. I'm almost always the one not included in trips, meetups and the one who everyone goes to as a last resort for hanging out.

I will admit that to a lot of people, I am probably a boring person(quiet, very laid back/non excitable) and I don't drink alcohol while the rest of my family does(so that could be a reason)

But it seems to be a common theme that I am everyones last option even when it comes to my own family sadly. They tend to only come to me when they need something, want to vent about other family members when they are fighting, or if they are seeking drama that they think I might know about the other family members.

isfp,"Hi there everyone, I recently learned about the different personalities and I've been trying to use this as an opportunity to learn more about my partner and their needs as an isfp. I've noticed their need for space, their independence, creativity, sense of adventure, and lack of wanting to plan things.

I'm an esfj so a few of these things I've had to get used to some of these traits and I try to be as empathetic and understanding about them. But I would like to ask some questions in order to further understand possible behaviors of my partner or maybe the way I make them feel with my own actions. 

- Do isfp's want to be sought out? I know they are independent and enjoy their space but i feel that maybe if i don't message, ask them out or something they might think im just not interested or something along those lines.

- how do isfp's show their affection? Whats the love language tend to be like?

- Do they enjoy words of affection? Most of the time I tend to not get replies or affirmation and that's fine but at this point I wonder if loving someone just goes without saying for an isfp.

In the end I'm just trying to be a more empathetic and understanding partner. Reading about the way isfp's and esfj's are made me realize I may be too needy towards a person that just requires space and independence.

I remember being in some hippie grocery store one time and my kid was hungry so I walked up to the deli to order a ham and cheese sandwich. Well they offer me like FIFTEEN different kinds of bread. ‚ÄúIdk white. Or whatever the normal one is.‚Äù And then they wanted to get cute about that until I became annoyed and just pointed to one. But THEN they made me go through the same routine for like five or six different choices of ham, twenty different kinds of cheeses, and they even had FOUR DIFFERENT FLAVORS OF MAYONNAISE. I firmly refused any more condiments or toppings for fear we‚Äôd waste away to nothing while weighing our options. 

By the time I received this (like ten-dollar!) sandwich, I was fuming and my son was irritable af. 

Anyway, that‚Äôs a small-scale example of a scene that plays out for me every time I have to make an important decision. I decided to get a masters, and suddenly it‚Äôs this ever-growing flowchart of choices: do you take the easy route and further your education in a field you‚Äôre ambivalent about?

Well if I‚Äôm going to spend all that extra time and money anyway, why not go after the masters I‚Äôm passionate about? But then I won‚Äôt have the job security I know I‚Äôll get with the boring one?

He was also extremely fetish forward!  He was very submissive to me and very eager to please even though he looked like a warrior, he was really a sensitive sweet flower.  I adored him and lavished him with love and attention.

isfp,"Hi fellow ISFPs. 

I‚Äôve found so far on this subreddit that a lot of ISFPs talk about their impulsivity and spontaneity, being more concerned with the present moment and not being very good at future planning or strategizing- but this is not me. Typically, for an ISFP, I am not very impulsive and I have never done anything to seriously jeopardize my life, because I am able to visualize the bigger picture and consider future consequences. I am not a bad planner, and I usually prefer to be thinking about the immediate future at all times to make sure I‚Äôm on track with my goals. I‚Äôm also a pretty conscientious and responsible person for a P type, but not to the extent of an xxTJ. 

I‚Äôm also not super sensitive. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I am sensitive, but not to the extent it seems some other ISFPs are. Most of the time I am able to just let things roll off my back, unless it‚Äôs a serious personal attack on myself or something I care about, but that doesn‚Äôt really happen often- and even if that does happen, I am able to calm down later, detach and remind myself it doesn‚Äôt really matter. I don‚Äôt feel as if I‚Äôm as connected with my senses or the present moment as much as some of you are, I‚Äôm usually in my head thinking about myself and my values (Fi) or planning (Ni). 

The thing is, I don‚Äôt think this makes me any less of an ISFP. In my worst moments, such as the Fi-Ni loop and Te grip, I definitely have these traits- I become anxious about the future and can‚Äôt see past the present moment, thinking I‚Äôll be stuck there forever, and I become super self-conscious about myself and my abilities. I can become really sensitive, and really hurt by something someone did that normally I would care less about. But this is not me, and I don‚Äôt want this to define my personality. This is me when I‚Äôm *unhealthy.* It feels like I am an entirely different person when acting this way. 

What about any of you? I really don‚Äôt want to stereotype anyone, but I sometimes just feel like I can‚Äôt really relate to other ISFPs. I want to destroy the bias I may have and broaden my perspective. I have another ISFP friend and it seems like her default is me when I‚Äôm unhealthy, but that‚Äôs not my default.

Why the hell does she do that? It is actually appalling and it makes me ashamed of being a female!!!! Like I totally do not understand it. Is it jealousy? insecurity? Why can't she just speak her mind?? I see she is totally fuming and I ask her like five times ""what's up?"" and she is like ""nothing nothing!"" and then I look away and yet I can still SMELL her feelings seeping through. My dad spent all afternoon doing volunteer firefighting just because and here she comes trying to get a rise out of someone. What the hell? If I straight up tell her how her behaviour is actually not cool and how she can improve I don't even think she will  listen!!! It is all about her feelings and sometimes I can even tell when she gets jealous me. That is so weird. Like for real. When I first moved back here she started her passive aggression on me and that shit does not work on me. I just straight up attacked her back until she learnt her lesson and now behaves herself for the most part until she tries shit again then I handle her appropriately. Why does she care so hard if nobody eats her food? Like wtf? It is not by force right. Sometimes people wanna eat something else!!! I totally do not understand it.

isfp,"So i met this guy in January. Hes ISFP (30m) and im ENTP (31f). Hes everything that id want in a partner. At first he said he wanted a relationship. We dated for a few months and things seemed to be going well. I asked him where he saw things going and he said that he had been struggling with commitment lately. We decided to continue seeing eachother casually. I told him that id do that until I met someone that I wanted to pursue a relationship with.

I had fwbs in the past, but this was different. Id go over there and he'd cook me dinner, we would hang out, have sex. He'd ask me to spend the night and we would cuddle all night, and then he would make me breakfast in the morning and ask me to hang out some more. He acts like he wants to take care of me. We would also text almost everyday, all day long. He replies fast and he keeps the convo going. And once I think he also may have gotten jealous when I told him I had recently spoken to one of my exes, which seemed weird to me. I told him that I was dating other guys, but he told me several times that he wasnt seeing anyone else. And I believe him.

But anyways, i started to get too attached to him and I told him that we needed to stop with all the extra bonding stuff and keep it to strictly just sex. And that we should also stop talking so much. He told me that he just really likes to cuddle and stuff. And he said ""you do know that I do still want a relationship at some point, right?"" I told him that I still didnt want to do any of that, bc i didnt want to get even more attached and then get hurt later if nothing came of it. He told me that I needed to stop being so scared of being vulnerable. I distanced myself a lot after that. 

But shortly after that I met someone I wanted to pursue that was looking for the same thing that I wanted. I ended it with him and started seeing the other guy. That didnt end up working though, bc he turned out to be a jerk. So I texted the ex fwb last week after not seeing eachother for like 3 or 4 months and we made plans to hang out. 

I went over there and he seemed SO excited to see me. We had dinner and he kept reminiscing about our past dates, and the times in the past that we had sex. He told me one memory and I told him that I didnt remember it, and he said ""you really dont remember that?!"", and he seemed like kinda sad that I had forgotten it. He has never reminisced with me in the past so it was weird. He wanted me to spend the night, so I did. We cuddled all night. In the morning we both had to leave for work and he was offering me something to take with me so i wouldnt be hungry. And like an hour later he texted me asking if i made it home. 

I dont want to get my hopes up or think too much into it. Honestly at this point i've given up on even trying to have a relationship with him, bc I dont want to get hurt. But i feel like I may have overlooked stuff in the past bc i was too scared to get hurt. Now im starting to think that maybe he did want a relationship with me all along, but he just wanted to take it super slow to get to know me really well bc his last ex stole a bunch of money from him. He has always been consistent with me with everything. Has never acted distant or hot and cold or anything. He just didnt want a relationship. He has always been very open and honest. Hes a sweet guy.

I havent asked how he feels now bc ive asked him a couple times in the past, and i feel like it wont be any different. And im not going to pressure him about it either.

isfp,"Hey ISFPs-- ENFJ (21f) here! I've heard a lot of mention in r/enfj that our types are very compatible when it comes to romantic relationships... and now I've found myself talking to one through Bumble! It's funny because I've talked to many different guys on dating apps during quarantine, but surprisingly no one has intrigued me quite as much this ISFP (22m) has. What's even funnier is that he is actually not a good texter or conversationalist at all-- something I value a lot when determining who I will try to pursue on dating apps. I seem to be the one driving the conversations and asking *him* questions, but he doesn't seem to reciprocate the questioning unless it's a ""how about you?"" to something that *I* asked *him* originally.

However, when our conversation started to die down on Bumble, he proceeded to give me his number if I was interested in taking the conversation off of the app. Of course I was! Although this action didn't catch me off guard since exchanging numbers is a common practice on dating apps, after learning more about the ISFP types, I recognized that this is actually  a bold/ballsy move for an ISFP to do (??). (Correct me if I'm wrong). So I took this as a sign that he was interested in talking to me and crossed my fingers he'd get better at conversing. Sadly, he hasn't really. Although he doesn't have one line responses,  they don't tend to have enough meat for me to dive deeper into the convo. He also doesn't ask many questions about myself which I find a bit frustrating, despite literally giving him bait to ask me questions. 

**ISFPs: Do you have any insight on this? Is he interested? Are y'all just bad conversationalists over text lol? Should I stop asking him questions?** I'm conflicted because like I said, he intrigues me a lot. Out of the many guys I have talked to on Bumble, he's the first guy I was genuinely thrilled to have give me his number so my gut says to stick with it but I admit it's a little discouraging.

Even though she admits that she feels bad about these episodes that she experiences.

One thing she really wants to have a hand in writing for example is the Batman Universe, and she's a huge fan of Batman the character so she hates what she feels is the incredibly unfair treatment that he's given.

She really wants to do some writing involving Batman but every time the topic comes up she'll eventually start ranting about;

Bane breaking his back
Arkham Knight's ending
Barbara getting paralyzed
Jason getting murdered

Just in general she'll start bringing up every single bad thing that's ever happened to Batman.

And then eventually she just decides that she doesn't want to role play anymore, and then she does a little bit later.

If I make a suggestion like why don't we just say it's set in an alternate universe where none of the stuff you have an issue with took place that actually seems to piss her off even more. Because it's like she wants it to be real. She genuinely wants there to be a comic for example where Bruce just genuinely straight up beats the absolute heck out of Bane as payback for getting his back broken.

I mean I do understand how she feels, I do have sympathy. I get that Batman as a character has had more than a few stories where he has been humiliated in some fashion or another and I understand that as a fan of his she's very annoyed by this.

isfp,"Hello fellow Isfps, this is my first post ever on reddit (I'm nervous.)

I'm sorry for the (very) long text, but I really need advice to help me reconcile with the Isfp I was friends with until not so long ago. (sorry for the mistakes, english isn't my first language)

To sum it up, there was this Isfp (23M) I (27F, INFP) became friends with, mainly because I commissioned him an art piece around a year ago and because we're both graphic artists. We surprisingly got familiar pretty quickly upon discussing commission details, and then talking about everything and anything on the phone for hours. I then noticed he needed at lot of space and since we live hundreds of kilometers apart, we would mostly chat through Discord. 

I actually liked his seemingly aloof, detached personality whilst I was more of an emotional, demonstrative person around him. It felt relaxing. He would tell me when I was being too communicative to his tastes (first person to tell me so), and I admit I found this a bit frustrating since I would have liked to share everything that went through my mind w/ him. I would also tell him his -sometimes- extreme distant personality was unsettling and new to me. I did my best to adjust to him (I think he tried too), but it was like coming from a totally different part of the universe (yet I was fascinated by his unique 'aura').

Fast forward a few months, we started playing an old MMORPG together. It was great. We'd laugh so much and sometimes he would open up a bit more, such as telling me about what he'd do during the day or his favorite music, or even complimenting or reassuring me about various issues I had atm (including my appearance, my goals in life etc). I knew how rare those moments were and I cherished them with all my heart (still do to this day).

 It seemed the game provided an environment where he could actually express his feelings more easily. I felt at ease and would doodle silly little things during the day, which he seemed to enjoy. It was a special artsy relationship and I loved its quirkiness.

Then the end of the year approached, we were playing less, I was busier with my own life (a very demanding contract and a trip I had planned a long time ago).Our conversations were a bit less enthusiastic and I felt tired of having to engage the conversation 90% of the time.

And also, he wasn't finishing the art I commissioned him. Like, at all. I told him he wasn't being very professional but I was like ""okay I paid upfront and I trust him, I'll let him take his time"". That wasn't a big deal after all, the friendship was of course way more important to me. He told me the artwork was not his priority and that he had other things to get done first, that he would get it done 'when he felt like it'. I have to mention he ALWAYS had that nonchalant attitude I couldn't fully grasp since I have a different set of moral values and principles I stick to.

We more or less kept in touch until april, when I had one of those impulsive moment and told him bluntly 'Okay I need to stop trying to ever talk with you' because he deliberately ghosted me once again (I should have known better) , blocked him aaaand that's it. 

I thought it was the best solution at the moment because I sincerely believed he didn't give a crap about me, and that I was always making all the efforts, and that if I vanished from this world he wouldn't notice. I threw a fit and that's it.

He never contacted me back. I did not either. Until today. Because I needed to know about the commission since it's been a whole year. But mostly because I f\*cking miss him actually.

I told him I was sorry for behaving the way I did. I tried to play it cool.

He replied a couple hours ago :

'I'd rather talk with you if that has something to do with the commission, or in person. This way you won't be mad at me ghosting you and I won't be mad about you being frustrated again"" with the message was attached an almost-finished artwork, which quality surpasses anything he's ever drawn before. The effort was astounding. It felt so warm yet bitter. 

I know that I deserve to be scolded. After all I've been the one cutting all communications means between us on a whim.

However here I am, wanting to apologize more than ever and change things. I don't want to lose him. I tried being as sincere as possible, telling him I acted without thinking, that it was a mistake on my part and that he really meant a lot to me. I told him I should have walked in his shoes, that I wouldn't engage conversations if he didn't like it, but this cold situation has become unbearable. I wasn""t expecting him being so affected either.

Sincerely I don't know what I should say to make him KNOW that am sorry. It's like I'm lacking the specific words (or the whole dictionary)... I feel helpless.

PRECISIONS :

\-Even though I like speaking my mind, I am a caring, understanding person. I never met some like him before and always was able to find ways to communicate with pretty much everybody else. I've gathered all the information I could regarding the ISFP personality type yet I am not an ISFP myself so there's so much I can grasp. I've always been respectful to him until I felt sorta neglected.

\-I should mention he acts pretty different in person (such as spontaneously cooking for me, giving me books I'm interested in, wanting to spend time with me in situations he normally runs away from such as theme parks). (we met like twice and I was the one asking him out)

\-I don't know when or if I'll be able to meet him physically again. Right now I only have internet to reach him.

isfp,"hey isfp fellows. I recently started my journey on typing myself and I'm having trouble getting to a conclusion. I think that it may be connected to the the fact that I'm used to idealize myself as a X type of person, but unconsciently being more like a W (for example, I used to think that I was more logical than a feeler, but that's a lie I told me). Also, I dont really know in what info should I rely on, since most YouTubers seem to be criticized by this community and most youtubers say that tests don't work at all. I know I can always get deep into the cogntive functions, but back to one, I don't really know what's real about me and what's an idealization. 

I already read the cognitive functions and I'm torn between isfp and infp (deep down I still hold to the possibility of being a isfj too). At first I thought I was past-oriented, but then I realized I don't hold into past that hard (to be an ISFJ) and I end up not having the great memory I thought I had. So I started investigating how  SI manifests in other positions, I thought I could be an infp (Si-child (tertiary idk)) because I feel a lot of nostalgia all the time. For example, I constantly miss being a child or even a high schooler (I just got out of school???), but what I miss the most are memories of especific days. I miss traveling with my best friends, I miss the first day of high school. What all this memories have in comon in my head is that which one has a especific song, clothes or smells I hold on to. 

I remember the smell my first dog had when it came home, and I was three yo. I remember the smell of grape sunscream from when I went to the beach as a five yo (I used to remember the smell of the plants that had there but I forgot after some time). I remember the song I chose to listen the most during my first trip with friends (which was i took a pill in ibiza) and the songs I used to listen when I first got secure of my appearence and personally (which i'm not anymore haha) which was ease from troye sivan and love myself from hailey steinfield.

Hello my ISFP friends,

I am a female INTJ. I am here because I like my ISFP friend. I want to take your advices. 

We met at the university. First we were in the same study group and then we became best school friends. In february, one of my girl friends in my class started to behave mean. I was feeling broken and my feelings to him turns different type of feelings. I had never liked anyone like that for 3 years. He was always caring about me and this was warming my heart. But we can not see each other because of corona virus. We are talking every day with whatsapp, instagram and Skype(rarely). I cannot be sure of his feelings. He is more emotional than me and generally I initiate conversations. I am trying to show how much i love him but it seems like he avoids from expressing his feelings. And I am really struggling to analyze. 

Wherefrom last week I realize that he likes sadly post on Twitter and Instagram. He didn‚Äôt tell me anything but he is mostly positive person like ‚Äúlet it go‚Äù. I am on the fence. I do not want to bore him but maybe I can help him.",1593420768

isfp,"Discovering your purpose can be a tricky thing. You don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre meant to be doing or how you can utilize your skills to bring value to other. So often we‚Äôre told that we should seek to find our passion. While this is true, there‚Äôs a little bit more to consider.

An age-old Japanese philosophy called **Ikiga**i has been known to allow people to live a long and happy life. This is especially true in Okinawa, which is home to the largest number of centenarians in the world.

The way that I was able to move closer to my purpose was to consider 4 components of one‚Äôs life that allows one to find their Ikigai

\-What I love

\-What I am good at

\-What the world needs

\-What I can get paid for

So often we tend to assume these components as completely separate from each other but they‚Äôre much more intertwined than we know. This is such an awesome concept and I explain this in depth here - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOZtBlrMvek](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOZtBlrMvek)

isfp,"Back in around 2010 to 2015 I tried to RP in groups. Usually on a certain ites forums. For a while Marvel/DC especially Young Justice  forums were super popular. Being a solo roleplayer at heart though I  never really fit in well.

One thing I remember  that always irritated me is that when it came to group RP if you weren't  one of the Admin's ""friends"" they didn't really care, and more than  once I felt like I was in an antagonistic place because one of the  Admin's friends would be rude to me, and yet their behavior was never  admonished.  


I remember one time for something that admittedly was  crappy on my part the Mod of a forum sent me a pretty rude message.  More than likely she acted emotionally, and sent her message without  thinking clearly.   


Even when I brought it  to the Admin's attention nothing was ever done. The Admin didn't give  her a warning for her rude manners. She didn't say anything like;   


""While I appreciate your concern for X, you've made Aireux feel uncomfortable by confronting her in an overly hostile manner.""  


There was nothing. I never understood it.

And  I do call my friends out. I'm lucky to have some pretty decent friends,  but I am willing, and have called them out when they're being mean, or  just rude to others.

isfp,"Hiya! So I recently came across information on ISFP‚Äôs ego development process! I was reading through it and thought it would be helpful to share. Apparently finding your mbti type is the first step and from there, you can develop your type by working on yourself through healthily engaging with your functions. 

While the 2 lower levels feel familiar, I think I‚Äôm currently at halfway between level 3 and 4. I do remember I had been at my best at level 5, though, because I come across stuff I‚Äôd written that I‚Äôm amazed at. It‚Äôs probably the whole COVID situation messing with me. Unfortunately it seems that it‚Äôs not a video game, so once you reach a new level, you don‚Äôt necessarily stay there, you can regress if you don‚Äôt work at it (like I did). I really do wonder what a level 7 ISFP is like...In any case!  Would you be willing to tell me which level you guys are at?

isfp,"About 4 years ago, when I was 19, I had a short but intense, passionate, amazing relationship with a girl I met at a party. We had lived down the street from each other for years without knowing the other one existed, until that night at that party. From that moment on we didn't leave each others sides for three months, until I had to move far away because of a job I couldn't say no to. The job was supposed to last for 3 months and we promised each other to continue where we left off when I got back. Unfortunately those 3 months turned in to 3 more months, our contact got more sporadic and things fizzled out. She moved away from the village we're from to attend college. 

My 6 months of work turned in to 4 years. During that time, I met another girl and we've been together for about 3 years. Things are stable and good, and me and my current girlfriend have moved back to the place I'm from.

I still think about her, that girl I met at that party and the relationship between us from time to time though. She must be on her summer break now, because I walked past her on the beach near where we're from today. We locked eyes and I instantly got transported right back to those months we had together and the fire between us. I know this is unfair and wrong, but I've been thinking about her even since, and romanticising and idealising what could have been. It feel like I'm in a weird poem, or a movie. Having rewatched The Notebook recently doesn't help either. 

How can I make my thoughts go away. Or should I let them happen, maybe cry a bit and hope they pass before I plug in my old USB harddrive and dig up the photos I took at that party, the night we met?

Also, I've been drinking some wine tonight... Not the best combo ü•≥ I'd love some advice from like minded people,",1593041523
isfp,"Hi fellow ISFPs and other cool types, so... if you know even just the tiniest speck of personality theory you might have heard about ""The Barnum/Forer effect"" which basically boils down to ""Personality tests suck  because all the results are tailored to fit just about everyone"" but long story this guy Bertram R. Forer gave a quiz to his students and told them he would give them personality vignettes unique for each, but he just gave them the same thing which said :

1. You have a great need for other people to like and admire you.
2. You have a tendency to be critical of yourself.
3. You have a great deal of unused capacity which you have not turned to your advantage.
4. While you have some personality weaknesses, you are generally able to compensate for them.
5. Your sexual adjustment has presented problems for you.
6. Disciplined and self-controlled outside, you tend to be worrisome and insecure inside.
7. At times you have serious doubts as to whether you have made the right decision or done the right thing.
8. You prefer a certain amount of change and variety and become dissatisfied when hemmed in by restrictions and limitations.
9. You pride yourself as an independent thinker and do not accept others' statements without satisfactory proof.
10. You have found it unwise to be too frank in revealing yourself to others.
11. At times you are extroverted, affable, sociable, while at other times you are introverted, wary, reserved.
12. Some of your aspirations tend to be pretty unrealistic.
13. Security is one of your major goals in life.

and presumably the students were like ""OMG thats me""  because the test was vague and mostly positive, and now some people tend to think all personality theory its just uwu positivey blah blah with no substance, and while this isn't a flawless personality theory, and for some people the personality shoe just doesn't fit (because lets face it we are all different), I just don't think these personality thingies should be thrown out the window , as one internet sage (just a random dude,on fighunter  lol but internet sage sounds better) said , that while both cat and horses had pointy ears doesn't mean they are the same animal, because different animals share similar traits, yet they are still different animals, this comparison was made for the four temperaments group, and I think this can apply to other personality groups, such as this,mbti.

In my case I have been confused about what my mbti type was because the tests say im INFP, some people said I was like an  ENFP, I have identified as an ISFJ before, and deep down I really wish I was an ENFJ yet I know I am an ISFP , its the first type I identified with when I found it randomly on Tv Tropes, but for the four temperaments and the enneagram, I can't find types that aren't 9w1 similar to mine nor my temperament being other than Phlegmatic-Sanguine , and Im pretty sure lots of you have seen other mbti types and were like ""No.that cannot be me"" and then you look at your type and go ""Well,that's me. or at the least this is the closest to me"" ,So I ask you what is in the title more specifically if you ever felt other descriptions are so far away from you. 

Oh, and before you ask about the horoscope, I feel I fit the pisces stereotype more, and I am an aquarius. 

and one last thing,how the forer test results apply to me :

&amp;#x200B;

**You have a great need for other people to like and admire you.** Meh, Kind of  but I have to like MYSELF first, and as Alaska and Thalia said A QUIEN LE IMPORTA LO QUE YO HAGA?!  A QUIEN LE IMPORTA LO QUE YO DIGA ?! (Who cares about what I do? Who cares about what I say?)  

**You have a tendency to be critical of yourself**. Everyones a critic. but most of the time I have to deal with myself. Im pretty awesome tho. not the best but perfect's overrated

**You have a great deal of unused capacity which you have not turned to your advantage**. No, I already used 90% of my brain capacity. Im a self proclaimed dumbass.

**While you have some personality weaknesses, you are generally able to compensate for them**. How?! my personality weaknesses are the main reasons of my conflicts! and my messy school life! this makes me cry &gt;:C 

Y**our sexual adjustment has presented problems for you**. my sexual what? 

**Disciplined and self-controlled outside, you tend to be worrisome and insecure inside.** Ha! ""disciplined"" ""self controlled"" ,  Im messy af and my worries shine through 

**At times you have serious doubts as to whether you have made the right decision or done the right thing.** yeah, but its best not to think about it unless you want to cry. 

**You prefer a certain amount of change and variety and become dissatisfied when hemmed in by restrictions and limitations.** define ""Certain"" because for some people just a tiny adjustement in life is fine and others do an extreme makeover of life and are still NOT satisfied!  and some people DO like restrictions and limitations (Yes,they exist) 

**You pride yourself as an independent thinker and do not accept others' statements without satisfactory proof**. No, Im the most guillible being in the world, I have fallen into the oldest tricks in the book again and again and again and again. 

**You have found it unwise to be too frank in revealing yourself to others**. Other no, Im pretty much an open book

**At times you are extroverted, affable, sociable, while at other times you are introverted, wary, reserved**. Define ""At times"" because it can be a 50/50 split or 60/40 or even extreme cases of 80/20. In my case im RARELY extroverted and sociable. 

**Some of your aspirations tend to be pretty unrealistic.** No, they are pretty common. 

**Security is one of your major goals in life**. FREEDOM (heck yea ) is one of my major goals in life",1593029025

isfp,"Hi folks,

has anyone of you experienced friendships/romantic relationships with INFPs before? If so, how did you experience it, how did you feel?

Background of the question:

I (INFP, f) knew this ISFP guy for around 5 years. We were in the same social circle that revolved around music (what else, right?).I always had the feeling, that we could talk SO much, if I just found the right topics to open him up a little. Tried a few times, never succeeded in the first 5 years.Fast forward to end of 2019:We met again after a longer time of not seeing each other, were so surprised and genuinely happy to see each other, that we exchanged phone numbers and a few weeks after that, we started talking. And it was crazy good! Each of us had tough times to handle and somehow he could make me feel just...really accepted. Like: yes, life can be really shitty, and maybe not everything is going to be ok, but that in itself is ok too. I hope that makes sense somehow, I just can't describe it better. And he told me that he felt totally at peace when he talked to me, which took him by surprise since that hadn't happen before with people.  
I learned so much from him about accepting my own feelings and handling them in a healthier way. Also I was really surprised, how much we could go in depth about literature, art, everyday philosophy. And though it was not necessarily his genre, he could easily follow me on scientific topics, a big hobby of mine. And to this day I haven't found anyone I could talk deeper and more emotional about music to. All in all - I felt very seen, such a HUGE thing for me (maybe for INFPs in general).There's no happy end though - there was a very important part of our lifes that didn't allign at all. It was so basic, that there couldn't be a middle ground. So as we both felt romantic feelings developing, we decided to go seperate ways. After a few months of literally no contact we tried to reconnect as purely friends, but that didn't work out. There was again this instant connection and to be honest, it hurt even more the second time I had to say goodbye to him.

So, my question here: Is it just me and him, or do ISFPs and INFPs just have this crazy close connection?

isfp,"I'm writing this post as a way to kind of vent and also reveal some more of the deeper parts of me. I've contemplated being an INFP and heck I might be, but I feel that maybe some of you could relate.

\- I'm very nostalgic. I have a lot of past melancholy and tend to struggle moving on from past hurts, sad past situations and especially people. I sometimes feel like I can't get those good times back and that I'm stuck always reminiscing them. It's unhealthy but I've gotten better at it. I just feel that once someone becomes my friend or something more, it's hard not getting attached and wanting your whole life to include them. I don‚Äôt unhealthily make it the only focus in my life but when I‚Äôm someone‚Äôs friend or when I‚Äôm someone‚Äôs boyfriend, I can‚Äôt help but relish and embrace every moment with appreciate, excitement and love. My heart just feeds on it. That‚Äôs what life is all about for me. Life is not only about fun, it‚Äôs also about the things you give and contributed to the world and relationships you have.

\- I really, really want to be someone who lives in the moment but my head's just in la la land even if I hate to admit it. I do love sensory experiences like dancing and waterskiing but when I'm on my own my head's always thinking about song lyrics, my internal feelings, what meaning I might find in the future, or creating a tv show scene in my head. I just don't find being an intuitive cool. Like, yeah, seeing a personal connection to a tv show scene isn't going to be understood in the eyes of anyone else, and I think it's reflected in my type me mosts. Maybe I want to be a sensor because I think my intuition is defective?

\- I act really bubbly, warm and affable at times but I tend to feel misunderstood and can become quiet and withdrawn just as easily. I was hanging out with some guys and they started to rank girls on their prettiness, the superficialness, disrespect, and shallowness of ranking people on something like attractiveness made me sick and I immediately went home and just felt...Lost in the world. I feel so deeply and it screws me over at times. I really want to be an ESFP, popular and happy go lucky with no effort, but deep down I'm just trying to sort through my inner world and find meaningful things not the shallow shit college offers. Even if I am popular I just can't maintain it without feeling like I'm crossing a line.

\- When I was a child I'd escape into my daydreams with hope of that daydream eventually becoming real. I'd imagine imaginary friends, I'd imagine the things we'd do and places we'd see. I don't blame myself. I was in middle school and being alone and in my head was the only way I could deal with anything. I'm in college and finding real people who I can actually trust and respect means the world to me. I just feel ashamed at times because I should be actively involved in the world, I should be able to not see shallowness, I should be able to suck it up and have a social media account and engage in reckless behavior, but deep down I'm too introspective and emotional seeking to actually be that and I feel that I'm flawed.

\- I'm a 4 and I often feel defective and internally flawed. I've been wearing a lot of masks recently to hide the inner emotional tension and the alienation that I constantly feel. I'm always thinking: Okay, if I act this way then I can be cooler. If only I was like (insert character) then I'd feel better. I'm starting to realize that me being a sweet, empathetic, affable, creative, artistic, zoned out, sometimes shy sometimes bubbly puppy personality might not be flaws. Maybe they are what make me me. I have just felt so defective in the past that I felt the need to change it and I'm starting to realize that, holy shit, maybe I should stop trying to become someone else.

\- There are a lot of things I love about myself, don't get me wrong. I'm very creative and have a lot of artistic skills. I'm so drawn to music, painting, writing, and acting and it's a wonderful gift for me and I love it. I'm also very romantic and good with girls in general. I have a lot of compassion and warmth alongside with confidence so it's not that my social relationships are faltering...I get along with people in college because I actively say hi and care for others but it's just that I want to find meaningful and loving social relationships. So far, I've found some every now and then. The older I get the easier it is to find, thank goodness.

I enjoy sensory things like dancing, going on waterskiing trips and skateboarding. These are all things I really enjoy and I love that adrenaline rush. But during childhood I was often told to stop getting so zoned out and pay attention and now as a 19 year old I guess I feel the need to try to change it. I'm starting to love myself more. I'm not really sure what type I am and at the end of the day my type doesn't define me, but I guess I feel maybe I'm unfairly setting unnecessary expectations on myself and using MBTI to try to fix myself when in reality I should be improving myself not trying to start from scratch and change who I am.",1592852251

Even though I can relate to basically every personality trait an ISFP has , I lack the most ¬´¬†famous¬†¬ª one that characterizes us.

isfp,"I don't relate to always being in tune with your surroundings. A lot of times I'm playing music in my head, and think about the fun things I want to do. I'm really good with recognizing taste, enjoying sensations like dancing or driving, and I always can tell when I'm hungry and enjoy different clothing styles.  I like for the things I do to have a concrete effect. I want abstract things like emotions to be expressable through art like music or painting or poetry. I want to understand the deeper meaning of a story to see if it can apply to my real life emotions or situations. I love walking around a forest and getting immersed in the beauty of it.  I love swimming in the ocean where I can feel the sun and the texture of water against my skin.  In school I wanted to find information that I could use or that applied to modern time. I don't enjoy thinking ahead or thinking about how a new business will open in a few months.

That being said I just tend to be spaced out quite often. People say I'm relaxed and subdued, assuming I'm smoking because of that.  Today, I didn't notice the porch was swept, I easily get lost and am not good with directions, I suck at team sports, and having been called out by others to focus more and pay attention.  A lot of these things strongly make me consider xNFP but I'm not sure.  I feel really in touch with a lot of Se descriptions when it said that we as ISFP's prefer to do something. I always prefer doing something with someone, engaging in dancing or a video game, that's how I bond and express myself, through physical reality, by engaging with it.

I guess I feel like a copycat ISFP. Why tf can I be so spaced out and unobservant at times if I really am auxiliary Se? Or am I just a Se wannabe? In the past I thought that I've had mild derealization so maybe that affects my type. Lmao, let me know your thoughts.",1592090617
isfp,"ISFJs, ESFJs and ESFPs.

For me:

ISFJs: I tend to get along very well with them and they can be very sweet people, but most of the time they tend to strike me as a bit boring, though every once in a while I can have very engaging chats with them. Some also really need to learn to chill out since they can be extremely stressed out a lot of the time and constantly panic about all sorts of unpleasant what-ifs for the future. Inferior Ne seems quite exhausting. 

ESFJs: I haven't seen many ESFJs in my life so far, but the few I did meet were like ISFJs turned up to 11, both the good and the bad. Though they're much more extroverted than ISFJs, I find that they seem quite a bit more chilled out (probably since their Ne is 3rd). ESFJs at their best are totally lovely.

ESFPs: One of my favorite types, I find that while I get along really well with other ISFPs, some can seem a bit pretentious and up their own asses (same for INFPs) to me, but ESFPs throw all that out of the window and are more fun. There's something really sexy about them too, and they're both super chill yet quite energetic at the same time funnily enough.

So my dad is an ISFP and he is one of, if not the worst person to communicate with. He and my mom run an electrical business and all of the workers find it a burden to work with him to the point that my mom apologizes whenever she has to schedule one with him. He has a one track mind on basically every topic I talk to him about and whenever I hold an opposing view, he gets offended and goes on about how I‚Äôve always resented him and that my tone shows it. I won‚Äôt get into much but he‚Äôs said some extremely hurtful things when I was very vulnerable and he‚Äôs done the same to my sister before. Ive gotta hand it to him, he‚Äôs an extremely hard worker, he‚Äôs extremely thorough and quick with everything he works on and never stops, but he holds every, especially me, to that same high standard and assumes that if I‚Äôm not doing physical work than I‚Äôm being lazy and doing nothing. If our family is eating dinner together, he chooses yard work over being with us, and when he does eat with us, he doesn‚Äôt care to learn anything about our lives and opts to talk about his political conspiracies. 
We sat him down a few weeks ago to talk about his communication skills and he started getting mad at us saying we needed to grow thicker skin. My sister brought up a time when she was showing him her painting (which won 1st in a national competition later on) and when she asked him about it, he said he didn‚Äôt get the meaning of it and it was bad because of that. Even though that happened 3 years ago and my sister asked him if he was sorry about it now, he still told her the same ‚Äúyou need to grow thicker skin and take criticism‚Äù.

isfp,"So i still am confused if im istp or isfp. I have tried to google the difference and i found that i do both. Idk how this is even possible. All the personality tests ive taken its istp sometimes and isfp sometimes. Im really confused.

So i found some istp vs isfp things and here is my view on it: 
(Left is istp and right is isfp)

-Decide with head vs decide with heart:
Decide with head normally but i have exceptions if my heart is really truly inclined to something then go with heart at those times.

-Judge based on logic vs feeling: 
Logic

-driven by thought vs by emotion:
driven my thought mostly but sometimes emotions also get me

-Critical vs empathetic:
i am pretty empathetic when it comes to thinking. Even if me being empathetic might change the whole story and a decision but when i actually have to make that decision i chose critically.
Maybe i think Empatheticlly and act critically.

-priority to truth vs relationship:
priority to truth

-impersonal vs personal:
i might seem and act impersonal for others and for normal things but i think i have a side of me that has thoughts that needs to be personal. 

-not easily upset by others remarks vs easily upset:
its depends upon the remark and the person who says it. 
Eg: remarks like ugly kinda upsets u if said by other people but not by family. But remarks like useless or worthless only hurts if its family who says it.

-rational vs passionate:
Rational

-objective vs subjective:
i tend to be both given the situation
Eg: if someone is said to be guilty for something and has tons of proof against him but his side of the story is very convincing and my gut feeling says that he is not guilty. Then i will still try to find proofs to believe that he is not guilty and understand the situation better rather than just going with my gut coz it could be a very convincing lie. But it still plays a role.

-critique even if its harsh vs complement :
if its the the people im close with then i honestly critique them but i try not to hurt them coz it somewhat matters to me. But if its just casual people then i just complement them if i have things to say. 

-want to be right vs compassionate:
i do want to be right but if its turns out im wrong then i can easily accept it. Idk if i am compassionate or not coz i feel like i do worry inside but i am very bad at showing it.

-fell good when a job is done well vs feel good when other people needs r met:
both

-brief and concise vs sociable and friendly:
im not brief and im not sociable but im concise and friendly

isfp,"Ok, I know this is somewhat random, but board games like Monoply, Ticket to Ride, Settlers of Catan, and etc I find utterly irritating. 
It's not so much the actions within the game that bother me, but rather how time consuming these games are. I can play for an hour or so before I realize that instead of wasting 4 hours pursuing the meaningless title of ""winner"" in a game that bears no relevance to reality, I'd rather spend that time working on a painting or staring at the sky or literally napping. 

The only reason I ever cave and play these games is to appease the voracious desires of my entirely extroverted family, who become sad and butthurt if I do not join and act like I am enjoying myself. 

I do understand why people love these games. I guess I am just curious if this lack of interest is unique to myself, or perhaps something other isfps experience as well and, if so, what cognitive functions in an isfp it might be due to.",1592021585

isfp,"Hello all, I‚Äôm new to reddit and this subreddit, and even MBTI in a way (I have only been researching/studying it seriously for a few months). 

I am stuck on whether I am an INTJ or ISFP. I know I‚Äôm a gamma quadra and use Fi, Te, Se, and Ni but I‚Äôm not sure in what order. When it comes down to personality traits, I am much more like an INTJ (analytical, ambitious, ect). But regarding the cognitive functions, I believe I instinctively use Fi-Se over Ni-Te, even if my Ni and Te isn‚Äôt terrible. I also find the Fi-Ni loop and Te grip relates to me more. 

As of right now, I believe I may be an ISFP Ni subtype. I am also pretty sure my enneagram is type 5 (wing 4), which may be another reason why I seem like an INTJ. Whenever I do take cognitive function tests, I type INTJ, but I believe that I may be biased. Not to mention that when I had two people very close to me take a cognitive function test posing as myself (basically how they thought I might answer based on their impressions of me), one of them got ISFP and the other INFP. Obviously different than what I get and hard to ignore. 

Is there anyone that can relate, or maybe give me some insight? Another thing is since INTJs are so statistically rare (especially for my demographic, I am a female) it is probably way more likely that I am an ISFP.

Ok I will start off by saying I love my sister. I understand that she does care about me and stuff but like we literally disagree on EVERYTHING down to the point of wether we need to take care of our health or not (she doesn't want to take care of herself and prefers to be productive mentally because taking care of her health wastes her time whereas I think health is moderately important at least because I'm diabetic and have a few other diseases myself ). She also keeps on emphasizing that she hates bias (like ok I get it gurl) to the point of saying it like more than once a day EVERYDAY.

I was actually in the r/INTJ subreddit a few minutes ago and I find some of their posts overwhelmingly similar to her (eg wanting to be free af and not wanting a family sometimes etc) and it makes me sad because it just reminds me of how we argue pretty much everyday.

And I just don't know actually lol. I want to keep my distance away from her sometimes especially sometimes she's very ruthless for criticing me everday (eg you know I disliked that you ... or to be fair you were always ...) and very obsessed about her crush. But I just cant because neither of us really want to dettach from each other (emotionally). Idk what I really think I should do because if I talk about this to her she will tell me that ""ok fine, I feel you sad I will just [be on the other extreme end of always agreeing to me and heavily sugarcoating her words]. This is why I want to be passive instead! Noone is happy about me!"" Which may not be her intention to make me feel horrendous but it does.

I really feel most confident and build confidence when I am alone and have time to appreciate myself. But now that my energy is in the presence of others all of the time I feel so lost and almost pathetic in comparison. 

I guess I am just too sensitive, but I am fed up with the amount of confidence I am losing and am worried it could become a bigger problem.

Does anyone have any advice as to if I am griping/ looping/ anything? What are some ways I can use my other functions to help? Or just some ways to help build confidence in general during quarantine.

Side note: I think that I am an isfp based off of the function stacking (i use se more than ne i believe), but I guess I am more of an infp stereotype? I know stereotypes are dumb, but I have been feeling insecure about my identity which is silly and its hard to relate to anything feeling lost like this",1591883382

isfp,"I'm pretty sure I'm an ISFP 4w3, 479.  I'd love to know that I'm not alone and someone can relate!

**- Have you ever found strong emotional connections in your environment?** Whether that be two birds flying, or the greenness of trees, or the way the air smells.  I find moments where you can just stand still and breathe and engage with things around you so meaningful.

**- I strive for emotional meaning but also try to be down to earth.**  I'm not going to overspend and I'm not going to ponder about something if it doesn't have a practical purpose. I like to talk and do meaningful things that have a concrete impact. I love music because it's such a good way to get all your emotions and thoughts down into a song that can be heard and that can be felt and resonated in the real world.

**- I definitely see meaning, and enjoy finding the deeper connections.** I definitely get a lot of hunches and have deeper feelings about things, seeing the meaning behind a sunset or feeling spiritually inspired outdoors. I feel the most meaning when I can experience it in a sensory way. Hugging a friend causes me to appreciate friendships and love more because I understand pain.

**- At the same time I'm pretty practical in school.** Learning about old people or old stories that didn't give me a good tool to use in real life isn't fun for me. I want to learn talents and skills that apply to my everyday life. I want to learn how a piece of literature connects to people's everyday emotions and how it teaches us something now, today, something that we can use.

**- I love physical rushes. I'm calm and careful but I need my life to have excitement.** I tend to zone off into my emotions and tend to seem spaced out and unobservant to people otherwise, because I need to have something to stimulate and engage me.  I was awful at driving a car at first, it was awkward at first, but eventually I found a lot of enjoyment from being able to feel speed and control it.  That said I suck at sports. I have awful body coordination for basketball and tend to struggle with staying focused and aware and I can't shoot it to save my life.  I do enjoy solo sports like tennis however and find myself being much more focused when I enjoy it.

\- **I feel disconnected with people but openly remain friendly.** I tend to be self righteous and find a lot of people shallow and immoral. I struggle wanting to get close to people because most people make me feel they are immoral and little things like them posting a picture of someone who got drunk at a party and laughing make me feel extremely unsettled. When I find real meaningful people to grow with and develop I tend to appreciate and enjoy them so much because of my usual disconnections. I love when school allows me to be in groups where I can chit chat with everyone and do something fun with them. However, I can also withdraw and be a loner.  I tend to be the loner who is cheerful.

**- The world makes me sadder than most.** I've tended to feel extremely sad when people get hurt, seeing shallow relationships and watching immoral people be moral. I tend to be extremely broken and fearful that the ones I care will do something wrong or hurt someone, that we're all stuck in this shallow world where hook ups and shallow friendships are all that we have. Seeing and finding real meaningful people really showed me the good when all I had in childhood was fear of the world.

\- **I love to dance.** Like, damn! It's perfect. I love being connected in the moment, just forgetting about all the sad and negative thoughts and let myself let loose with fun and expression.  Especially around people. I can seem extroverted at times, dancing in the middle of the room when no one has the guts to do it. I have a childlike smile and excitement to me. I enjoy being affable and goofy even when I don't feel I fit in. I like to treat others how I want to be treated and don't see the world in terms of status, I see people for the meaningful traits they show.

\- **I can be a leader and strong willed if I have to.** I'm extremely good at standing up for my beliefs and values. I am unhesitant in the face of immorality. I tend to be very calm and relaxed at most things but when it comes to standing for a person or belief I definitely have a take charge, father hen style of will.

\- **At my worst I tend to drown into my emotions, feeling that I cannot escape them and feel panicked and anxious about the future**. It's like the future is a fixed point and the negative consequence I fear is unable to be changed. I'm unable to live in the moment, instead reminiscing over a happy past and feeling unhealthily nostalgic all whilst fearing the future and wanting to run away from it.

I told him he needs to be able to trust me to just tell other men to F off if that happens. He says he does but he still wants me to put his name in my bio. I'm almost 25 years old and I just feel like that is such a childish thing to trip up over? A FB bio??? So last night I took off his name and added my chicken hobby in there instead. Bf. Lost. His.

isfp,"I don‚Äôt know where else to post this really, but I like you guys and maybe with out like-mindedness you‚Äôll have a solution for me. 

I haven‚Äôt been affected by anything like the BLM movement in a really long time. As an ISFP, I sometimes get caught up in the news when it‚Äôs in front of me but I can usually let it go by bedtime. But this time I really can‚Äôt. It‚Äôs been the third sleepless night in a row and my feelings have been so overwhelming and I‚Äôm having such a hard time processing everything and I feel so hopeless. 

I hate that black people have to fight so hard just to feel safe. I hate that some people don‚Äôt see the privilege they have. I worry that my future partner, child, family, friends will have to learn to act a certain way or apart a certain way so as to not incite violence from a cop. I worry that more deaths will happen before action is taken. I worry that world leaders have too much power in influencing the thoughts and inciting hatred from their citizens. I hate that there‚Äôs so much focus on looters and property destruction as if sports fans don‚Äôt do the same when they‚Äôre celebrating. 

I feel so sad that my cousin, who‚Äôs boyfriend is black, worries when he goes out on runs. I dread arguing with my mom who insists that the protests are doing more harm than good. I hate reading the ignorant posts insisting #alllivesmatter. I despise the people participating in the George Floyd challenge who mock his death and mock the movement. 

But what I think haunts me the most is that I keep going back to the thought that realistically, discrimination against people that are not like oneself is never going to fully disappear. Racism, sexism, ageism, homophobia, xenophobia etc. will forever be present in the world as long as we‚Äôre human. We can make huge strides but discrimination will never disappear. That thought terrifies me.",1591261888

isfp,"I'm trying to figure out whether I'm more Se or Ne.

Thing is, I love sensory things. I love good foods, beautiful aesthetic places, amazing sounds, making tangible music from intangible feelings and thought processes...I love a good sunset, dance or an adrenaline bike rush.  I want to have things be practical and apply to the real world. I feel most myself when I have these enjoyable sensory experiences. 

...But I'm also quite daydream-y and out of it.   I have a nostalgic and melancholy view of the world, and I tend to be living in my own world at times.  I've always had a very zen and deeper thought process ever since I was a child. I can easily see a connection between a sunset and a relationship.  I sucked at driving a car at first but over time learned to master it and enjoy the sensory experience of it. 

I'm just not sure if I'm an ISFP because of my desire for creativity to be tangible and my enjoyment for sensory things, or if (I think this is more likely) I'm an INFP who wants to be a sensor, is awed by it, finding some relief in exercising sensory things even if it isn't first hand.",1591231202

And another question, the first 3 months he really became sweet, lovely and a little bit clingy to me (all lovely dovey), but... this month he never gave as much affection (ton affection) as before - he said just because I thought I didn't want it, which I guess didn't make sense :/, so is that really the real reason or are there other reasons in u guys opinion? and is it common to isfps become like that in relationships?

Then after meeting in person when he touched me it was electric. I have never wanted to have sex with someone so badly. Yet he kept pressing to know how I felt about him. So I felt an overwhelming need to figure it out. My conclusion was that we had no longterm potential. I never cried so hard over someone I had only known 2.5 weeks.

She and I do a lot of role-playing and there are times where she gets really obsessed about making sure that certain numbers are all quantified.

One time for example we were doing an anime series where the characters are known for being rather rich but the series doesn't really ever explain just how rich they are.

So ISFP friend disappeared for about half an hour and then came back with a bunch of statistical evidence to prove exactly how much money they all had.

Or one time we were doing Halo/Mass Effect, and she wasn't comfortable with just saying ""Okay their ships/weapons are equal.""

She had this need to mathematically have it all laid out.

So she leaves, and comes back all like; ""Okay here's a sheet of how big/powerful/fast etc everything is.""

She then tells me she loves me and would never leave me but at the same time due to my trust issues, I cant help but question. I just try put my trust issues aside, understand her the best I can and realize she hasn't given me any reason to not trust her. She tries to stay positive and motivated but I feel something is eating at her very bad. She is motivated, inspired, and happy one day and then depressed not too long after. She says she misses me a lot. She also is very apologetic towards things that can be taken multiple ways (which I assure her I take no offense to and understand her).

I tend to be a huge daydreamer...I would say the things I daydream the most about are fantasy settings and characters. I hope to create a game one day or an animation featuring these characters and telling their stories. I love psychological fiction. Anything that analyzes the reasons WHY people are prone to make certain decisions and which delves into the thoughts processes of people is my thing. For this reason my dream career was to be a psychologist. My main goal in life is to find a worthy cause and dedicate my life to it. My identity is intrinsecally linked to my values, I would never betray them. For this reason, while I appreciate hearing other people's perspectives on things and have a passion for learning new things, I tend to be a bit stubborn in my beliefs, and can get defensive.

My hobbies are reading, stargazing, drawing, gaming.


My favorite genres in fiction are psychological horror and science fiction.


Whenever I enter a relationships I have a tendency to see other people through ""rose tinted glasses"" meaning I idealize them too much in my head. I am an introvert yet strangely people oriented and I tend to be quite talkative if I'm having a conversation about a hobby or passion of mine.

I'm a bit sensitive and an empath. The world seems cruel to me and I wish to change it. I'm good at telling what other people's motivations are but others tend to dismiss this as ""overthinking"".


I tend to change my hobbies a lot. There are many, besides gaming and reading, which I have tried and dropped before.

I enjoy music without lyrics, electronic music and shoegaze are some of my favorite genres. I like music as a way of getting involved in my feelings, I like songs that capture that. I also enjoy listening to music by itself and going into wild flights of fantasy and creating immaginary scenarios and characters.

isfp,"Hi

I've seen enough memes to know I'm not the only ISFP who struggles with planning and self-organizing skills for succeeding as an adult so I decided to join Reddit to ask for advice. I recently went through some anxiety which doesn't normally happen. It was related to money and having a useful recognized role to play in society. 

I need to feel free. I *need* it. I've worked multiple different jobs and roles and I loved it along the way, life has been good. I learned so much about myself. However any time I felt tied down or that I wasn't getting anything more out of the role at work, I simply left without a plan. It worked out fine for some time but now I think I've kinda hit a dead end.

I feel that my usual approach has reached its limit. I think I need a plan. However trying to make a plan so far only turns out making me anxious, scatterbrained and floundering for where to start. I try to go over my priorities and focus on what's important but it's like one thought leads to another and I forget I was working on a plan and find myself doing something completely different from my original intention. 

**Is it just a matter of practice? Are there any planning hacks for ISFPs in particular?** 

I cant seem to shake a sense of urgency and it takes me out of living in the moment. I think these recent world events have something to do with it because I cannot seem to imagine what the future will hold, and I used to be able to do that. It worries me.",1590739875

isfp,"So, here is another potential INFP-mistype here wondering if I am possibly ISFP and was wondering if you guys here could help me potentially type myself and get some closure to this question that\`s been nagging my mind for a while now. So to give you more perspective into my mind, here are couple of things about me. 

\-I am a male, 23-years old, a student. Kind of broody, quiet and shy. At first I can come off as rather reserved and not much of a people person, but according to my friends I am a lot nicer and gentler than I initially may seem and that I am very sensitive. A fact I am rather aware of as I am quite self-conscious and ashamed of it. 

I have a small group of friends who are the most important thing to me in my whole life. Never had truly much of a relationship with my father, was raised by grandparents and mom is in hospital. A thing I blame myself for and I can often find myself being deeply saddened and melancholic over the past. Contemplating and reminiscing over everything that has happened and wondering how it has affected me. I was bullied as a kid and this is also a thing I tend to keep thinking often about. Over and over again. My focus on future has always been largely about my dreams and ambitions over the kind of life I want to have and the kind of person I want to become in the next five years or so. 

Growing up I didn\`t have many friends. I was always the shy and quiet kid who tried to get along with everyone else and especially the cool kids. I was bad at sports and was hugely clumsy. I was however decent at drawing, my first real true passion which I still practice to this day.  My style of drawing mainly resolves around comic-book and -noir characters, using heavy shadows and lots of cross-hatching to give it the kind of aesthetic I like. I am hugely into fiction, especially comic-books and other fandoms of the like and I can often find myself relating to the characters I like and modifying my own behavior according to them. Often trying to be like the characters I admire- or their specific character archetype. I might try this with people in real-life that I truly admire as well. 

I am largely into cinema especially old-classic films and smaller indie-flicks. I am avid listener of indie-rock as well as old-classic rock and jazz-music. I have been told by my friends that I dress-well, with my casual clothing being kind of grungy with lots of lots of ripped jeans, leather jackets, bomber jackets and trench coats. However I also like to dress in a preppy, classy kind of manner, often being more than glad to wear a suit- or a dress shirt whenever I get chance. I spend a lot of time with my hair during the mornings .

As I grew up , I began to get more into sports. First, I began practicing martial-arts and running as means of losing weight at around age 12 as I was quite the chubby kid back then and as a teenager I was hugely into boxing and- other martial arts. Becoming quite good at them. It was a good way for me to blow off a lot of steam- and over the course of time I became good enough of an athlete to have the best fitness tests at school. I still practice boxing to this day albeit in more on/off kind of manner and I go to  the gym around 4 times a week to maintain my physique. As an adult I got into basketball as well after watching a fictional movie about it and getting inspired. It was one of the reasons I got into boxing as well. 

I often find myself pondering and thinking about the concepts of right- and wrong and especially justice. With my early career-choices in life being for me to become either a lawyer- or a police officer. However I opted more towards the lawyer route as I found it to be more financially stable and more intellectually challenging as means of proving myself to myself and others. I always felt like it was important for me to do something important for the society and to serve it. 

Because of this, my best studies at school were always social studies, history, psychology and philosophy with philosophy and psychology becoming hobbies of sorts for me as an adult and now a days I quite often read philosophical texts as a way of spending my free-time with Albert Camus being my absolute favorite writer.  Stoicism is also a major interest of mine and I am deeply into minimalism as my go-to lifestyle. 

So yeah, I would like to hear what you guys have to say about this? Do you think I am ISFP or do you think I am INFP, I would like to hear your thoughts and I would be more than grateful to hear it, as it would help me put this whole debacle to rest once and for all.",1590702834

isfp,"In elementary school, I loved music and art. I briefly played some sports, but never seriously pursued them. When it came to performing music and making art, on the other hand, I was competitive and ambitious. 

Being either smart or good at something was the only way I received approval. I‚Äôve always had a desire to perform, which may or may not be related to that conditioning. 

I was frequently goofy, since I enjoyed getting attention and making people laugh. At school I was decently well-liked and pretty outgoing with other kids, but very shy around adults and strangers. 

I had a lot of emotional problems due to growing up in a toxic family situation. I was insecure and could be catty and sort of mirrored the toxic behavior in my home. 

However, I know I was a good kid on the inside. I was highly concerned with morals, to the extent that I felt *extremely* guilty and anxious. Like, crying myself to sleep every night kind of guilty and scared of everything kind of anxious. It was a severe case of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not good enough.‚Äù Looking back, I feel sad‚Äî no 9 year-old should have to feel that way. A narcissistic parent will do that to you, though. 

The older I got, the more introverted I became. I got rid of most of the bitchiness I had as a 10 year old (lol), and have come a long way in terms of maintaining healthy relationships and being supportive of others.

It‚Äôs tough to tell how my personality would have been if I was mentally healthy back then, and that makes it harder to type myself today. I thought I was an N for the longest time, but now I think I might be an ISFP with developed Ni or caught in an Fi/Ni loop.

isfp,"I'm creating this post because I want to know if other ISFPs can relate to never feeling like they fit in despite knowing there are a lot of people who cognitively work in a very similar way to them.

In my case, a few years ago I've discovered MBTI. It took me like a year to finally be sure of my personality type, one part because of ISFP's thought process descriptions and also because of relying too much on other people's opinions who tended to type me as an NF.  
When I've finally figured out for sure I'm an ISFP, being happy to learn that there were other people like me, I thought I would finally feel understood. Because as ridiculous as it sounds considering we are not a rare type, I've always had difficulties to relate to other people (not in the ""I'm so unique"" sense, more like in the ""why can't I fit it?"" sense, as the title says).

Not that I'm not in the main lines the clich√© of the ISFP: I'm artistically inclined, a music lover, an animals lover, very sensitive, empathetic, very in touch with my own emotions and values and understand it very well. The few things I can't relate to when it comes to clich√©s is to always living in the present moment, to let things be and not overcomplicating them, as well as not being inclined to conflicts. I don't like it, but I'm pretty argumentative and I never hesitate to debate when I think someone is wrong and to defend causes that I believe in.

One thing I've noticed recently is that even with other ISFPs, a lot of misunderstandings can happen and a lot of conflicts can arise. Like I'll try to joke (nicely) with another ISFP and receive to my face mean responses like ""You're making me ashamed of being an ISFP"" or ""You're confirming bad stereotypes about us"" when I was just innocently joking, not saying anything mean or trying to cause any harm to anyone, as humor and enthusiasm is also a way for me of trying to connect with other people. That's maybe due to my enneagram type though as I'm a 6w7.  
Anyway, you'd think being from the same personality type, we'd be a little more understanding of each other's behaviors, but obviously no. So I came to think maybe it was my fault, maybe I do really think differently from most ISFPs somehow and maybe by being myself I really do spread bad stereotypes.

So I wanted to know, is this an ISFP thing? Or is it just a me thing? This could be it's only me as I've been feeling very vulnerable and emotionally fragilized about people's way of treating each other lately, but I wanted to know your points of view about that.Is that feeling of not relating even to people from your personality type something you can also relate to? Or do you usually feel like you're very similar to other ISFPs?

Maybe it's me who's just a little too sensitive, I don't know.

[Original Content]

Hello, as time has gone by, I've come to realize that there are a plethora of ways to look for one's foremost cognitive functions; and what a wonderful way it is, to read a person through their writing. 

I wonder if we resonate instinctually with the writings of those who think like us. If words that bleed the pain of one's mind entwine with the suffering of another's through the same tumultuous emotions that rule our ways. As with the Isfps and Infps. I feel that their toughest emotions are dealt with the same dose of helplessness, fervent tenacity, and neurotic desperation that hold a decisively woeful self-aggrandizing flair.

(I am likely a high Fi user, thus granting me the entitlement to poke fun at myself and my fellow snowflakes.)


This is why I have a humble request-type me through scraps of writing I have brought together over the years. In hopes that, in between the lines, someone may find a speck of self that corresponds to the nature of my truest bidding. Only then can I see truly objectively where I belong in typology.


I am most fascinated by opinions, so do drop by and leave a comment. Please, have a wonderful day.",1590082549

isfp,"Hello, ISFPs. I'm a random possible ISFP and I've been pondering over my type since I discovered MBTI. I've been mistyped as INFJ,  INTx  and now I'm here. My mind keeps coming back and asking stuff. 

I searched the internet all way round. I found so many views and statements that contradicted each other and I'm trying to make sense of it. Usually I would say the more the marrier! but I want to figure this out. From what I've read so far, these are the differences (please add your own, or correct me if I misunderstood):

‚Ä¢INFPs understand concepts faster than the ISFPs because of their aux. Ne. ISFPs are better with practical matters.

‚Ä¢ISFPs have an indirect relationship with their inner self (or something similar, I don't really know how to explain) because of tertiary Ni, while INFPs have an indirect relationship with the external physical world. I am not totally sure what this means, but I think it implies that ISFPs may be more comfortable and adapted to the physical and less with their thoughts and concepts (this doesn't include emotions and values). It's vice versa for the INFP.

‚Ä¢ISFPs are more likely to be fashionable than the INFP. I'm not sure on this one, but I do believe it holds some truth. In the end it depends on personal preferences anyway.

‚Ä¢ISFPs are more focused on details and INFPs are more interested in the bigger picture. Again, I doubt this one because both are completely capable of doing both of these things. Although, this leads me to an example. Both types are described as artistic in some way. When creating music, the ISFPs would be more concerned with the tune and notes (excuse me, I don't know anything about music). On the other hand, the INFPs would be more interested in the message of the song, and then the tune and how to implement it. ISFPs start with a rithm, and INFPs with a lyric. That makes me add: the INFP may be more prone to writing (this is only my assumption, please state if you disagree; I am not sure on this one)

This is about it. I excluded the 'INFPs are more creative', 'ISFPs are more practical' and things like these because it's relavite from person to person. I think these are the main differenes. Which one do I indentify with more? That's hard to answer. On dichotomy tests, I got only a slight preference for intuition; on cognitive function tests, my Ne is high, but as well as my Si and my Se is low. I may have some self-accepting issues because my behaviour doesn't always align with my ideal and values, which angers me sometimes, if not a lot. Am I in denial, or is this my Ne just acting up and Si analysing everything? Hard to say, but I reckon that I'm an INFP.",1589999458

The one thing that bothers me the most is the moral lecturing. I can tolerate them being outspoken, but when they turn it into a ""You're the bad guy"" speech is where I start getting ticked off.

Let me give an example involving a toxic ESTJ. I didn't fully clean off a spoon used for dinner, it didn't seem important. The serving spoon I mean. After I served my plate I put the serving spoon back on its own small plate. I didn't see the need to wipe it off right there, as dinner was still going on, and the spoon would have been used again.

So ESTJ lets me know that not only should I have wiped it off but; ""You \*\*need\*\* to learn to start being more considerate about doing the right thing.""

Seriously? Where did that even come from? 

I saw a post once saying that when dealing with an unhealthy/aggressive XSTJ to just let their whining go in one ear, and out the other. I have a hard time doing that. It's very difficult for me to just ignore when someone is putting me on blast. Well in real life. Online I don't care as much.

I called several more times, after which she blocked me everywhere.  And on this, our communication with her ended.  I started living in city N, then I started dating a guy, we dated for one year, and after that, I had the opportunity to move to another country.  During our dating, he sent me his photo on social networks, and she gives alike on this photo, I still thought that it was extraordinary.  Time passed.

isfp,"I can't figure out my friend's type 

* Looks very cold and unapproachable at first impression. She doesn't speak much and hardly initiates meeting a person first. However once you get to know her a little longer, she'll slowly begin to show her real side. She's actually a really playful, silly girl who laughs at almost everything and enjoys joking around with people. 
* She's a bit reserved and struggles with acting cute or cheesy. 
* Although it's very against the culture where she lives to the point of it being a taboo, she got many piercings and tattoos at the age of 15. She has her entire back tattooed with something she designed on her own. 
* She enjoys drawing and is very good at it. She also loves singing, writing her own songs, playing the guitar, acting, and dancing. She initially majored in art while in college before switching to some sort of communications major. 
* Her dream is to become a famous singer and she said she'll never stop chasing after her dreams and what she wants in life. 
* Extremely hard-working and focused on her goals. Her discipline is really good and she works hard to the point of tiring out her own body and getting stressed. Even then, she still tries to stop at nothing until she achieves her goals. 
* Although she looks like someone who's afraid of nothing and tough, she's not as fearless and strong as people perceive her. She admitted that she's scared that she hasn't worked hard enough, that there are things she hasn't completed perfectly, and that she has disappointed everyone who likes her by not meeting their expectations. 
* She used to barely have any friends at all because she was afraid of getting hurt and she's on the shyer side. Although she barely had friends, she always wished that she could have a lot of friends. On her birthday every year, she would feel sad, lonely, and anxious because she wouldn't have anyone who would celebrate it with her. 
* Even though she wants to have a lot of friends since she's never had many and has always been a lone-wolf type of girl, she's definitely an introvert who enjoys staying at home.
* She's pretty good at putting up a front when she's about to cry. However there are times where it's quite easy to see she's almost going to cry. Sometimes her mood flips within seconds, such as this one time where she was laughing then heard a comment. Immediately her mood flipped and you could see her lip trembling and her eyes starting to water. However the person expanded on their comment and said it was a joke then she immediately started smiling widely again. 
* She likes putting a twist on things and making them different. For example, she enjoys singing but when doing a cover of a song, she likes putting her own spin on it to make the cover a little different. 
* She claims that she's fast-paced and impatient. I don't really see it, but I suppose she could be on the impatient side. 
* She wants to bring everyone positivity and happiness. She tries to ignore anyone who dislikes her because she wants to stay happy and hopes everyone else is happy too.
* Pressure helps motivate her 
* She can enjoy compliments just like everyone else can, but what she cares most about is criticism. Once someone criticizes her, she puts all her focus on that and tries her best to improve. She can be pretty hard on herself.
* She says she's a straightforward person; however, she's more gentle depending on who the person is. For example, she's less straightforward with some of her softer friends because she's afraid she could possibly hurt their feelings, which she doesn't want to do.
* She knows how to cut hair and has spent a lot of time cutting other friends' hair too. She enjoys doing her nails and makeup. She has dyed her hair a shade of pink before and currently has burgundy hair.
* Very non-judgmental; she can be friends with anybody and doesn't care about what they do or what they like. 
* She once said something about not being the same person you originally were after going through a rainstorm, and that she hopes people can know her as someone with more possibilities.",1589756775

I can't typify my boyfriend, perhaps because he suffers from bipolar disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and narcissistic traits. I will try to provide a detailed examination of his history and his person.

He is a boy who carries trauma: since childhood he feels he is different and in an eternal struggle with the world and with others. He says that as a child he seemed autistic, because he perceived the world differently and played isolated, instead of playing with other children. Parents divorced when he was a child, and he speaks to me of his childhood and adolescence as a period of ""quarrels, violence and conflict"". He does not like to go into the details of his past, in fact what I know about him is really nebulous. He also suffers from a very rare neuromuscular disease and, at 20 years of age (he is now 30), had an almost fatal car accident. He absolutely loves nature: he has always done trekking, he loves the mountains, fishing, gardening, he is very good in zoology, mycology, botany. He often says he hates the modern world: he would like to live in a past where life was felt more strongly, between spiritual, sensory connection, combat. The only way he feels suitable for him in this modern life is to do the hermit in the mountains. He loves combat sports (in the past he tried various martial arts).  His library is full of books on: spirituality and mysticism, art of war, philosophy, gothic and fantasy topic, biology. He is good at video games. He is absolutely nihilistic, individualistic and pessimistic: he defines himself as ""Schopenauerian"". He believes that perception and sensations are superior to thought. It has its own personal philosophy that is impossible to affect. He hates conflict and quarrels, but when people don't understand the behaviors caused by his bipolar disorder he becomes hypercritical towards others, self-defensive and self-pitying, sarcastic, bitter and sardonic, with outbursts of anger (often not in front of others). He does not care about the good of the world, since he says he only understands evil now. He suffers a lot from loneliness and feels a perennial state of emptiness and an emotional contrast (""The emotions are too strong or non-existent""). It is, in any case, how the behavior he has towards the world is very different from what he has with me. He has always been very sweet, understanding with me, he tries to make me always feel good and he feels very guilty if he can't. Often he says ""I'm happy if you are too"". He has endured many of my crises without ever arguing. He loves my physical closeness and is very romantic. However, the fact that our relationship is more an exchange of sensations and love through gestures, does not make it easy for me to understand if it is an intuitive or sensory type, because, generally, we make deep speeches when it is on the edge of an emotional crisis. But most of the time it is of few words and silent, more concentrated on sensory experiences than on dialogue. He also has alcohol and cannabis addiction which he says are ""the only things that help him turn off his brain and feel less hatred for life."" In the first year we were together, it often happened that during his crises he sent me away, making me go back to my house. He is very habitual \[in trying to typify him, I almost ruled out being Infp like me. I don't see in him the Ne and that sort of enthusiasm and flow of consciousness that often involves outside. Also, it seems to me that the Se is too high for an Infp\]. He doesn't like to have new experiences very much. He did the artistic high school and then geology at the university. The latter choice was not felt but determined by external situations, and he repented. In fact, he would have liked to study either art, or cultural heritage, or philosophy. His house is very chaotic and messy (although he says he was tidy before the illness). He is often a procrastinator and a little lazy. It has no good relationship with bureaucracy. Crowd and excessive sensory stimuli overload him.

He told me he feels himself totally separated from the world and that prefer to live in his mental world rather than dealing with exter environment. When he doesn't feel well he becomes apathetic and slowed. He is interested in alterations of mental state. He has the fear of abandonment.

He overindulge in alcol, cannabis and drugs to stop his mental suffering and his sense of void.

As a closing I leave you some of his considerations:

""I hate the modern world, it is not compatible with me. Although I would probably have felt bad in another era too, at least it would have made more sense to die. As more natural. I prefer to live in a world where you remain isolated from society. I don't believe in the goodness of the world. I don't believe in good. People do good because they need others, or because they don't want to feel guilty. In the end, evil is more healthy, authentic, ancestral, ancient. The consideration  that the world is not black and white, but it has nuances, it is a way not to bring a speech to the extreme, but if you do not do it, it is as if you are talking in vain. The peculiarity is for the historicity or for politics, not for philosophy. Mine is not philosophy understood as love for knowledge: it is philosophy understood as love for my thought. I have never seen a philosopher who denies his thought for others. I am not sure that something exists  beyond the relationship between subjectivity and obectivity. I mean, my thought is by definition real. If everyone thought like me it would become real. But I don't care if the others think so too. My thought is true for me, and that's enough for me. ""

""If the drugs are Germany, the psychology that thinks it can make you happy is Poland. Cognitive-behavioral psychology is, after all, the repetition of a certain way of thinking, in the hope that the patient will end up agreeing. Would you imagine Schopenauer saying ""I stop being pessimistic because maybe I'm better this way?"" And it's because, while philosophy uses logical-deductive reasoning, psychology WANTS to think of it in a way. In fact, the psychologist's statements can be relativized. And he cannot answer if you point it out to him. The psychologist, when he studies you, perhaps does not think that the patient is also studying him. ""

""If there were no anger we would be overwhelmed by everything.""

""The fact that we think happiness is a primary value is due to the education we have received for a few centuries. For millennia man has not reasoned in this way.""

3""""

""I think the expression 'I don' t know' hides the pain of thinking about the topic itself, and that man likes to think of himself as being a much superior being thain he really is""

""It's not thought that hurt, but it is pain that produces thought. That's why I quit psychology. We identify ourselves with evil and we are convinced that we are"".

In any case, when he is calm he seems to prefer to share sensory experiences (food, nature, drinking, sex) and physical and emotional closeness with little deep verbal dialogue.

This importance given to sensations makes me think it may be an unhealty ISFP. But, as I said, I'm not sure.

I used to draw weekly comic for big company for a year. I got pretty good and stable money also new fans but it sucked my health a lot. I got sick many times during that period and I still remember how that long term contract challenged myself as an ISFP. It was like a good intense drama movie that you know it's great but watching it one time is enough. 

Since then I work as a freelance with no long term contract. Clients will come to me with their stories and tell me what they want me to draw. I don't use my creativity much, just use my skill. Payment is ok, it's not as high as what I used to get but I have more time for myself, for my life. 

Recently there's this comic competition coming up. They need many new artists to do weekly comic and even the competitors don't win the competition, they still be able to be their official artists. They know me that I used to be on this industry before and even asked me to be their official artists once but I didn't interested back then. 

Right now I have new idea for new story in my mind. I want to do it anyway but before this competition coming up, I thought I would draw it and public it for free so I can do it on my pacing, no need to rush since no one need to pay to read it. Basically I thought I would do it just for fun. But when this competition happens, I think about submit this work to this competition. If I become their official artists, There will be more readers that I can provide my work and also good payment but I will be back in that loop of hell that I don't have time for myself again. 

I'm not sure should I jump into the competition  or stick to my old plan. My friend told me I could do anything if I finish on making a decision and I know she was so right.

To name a few -

‚Ä¢ You could say I'm a dreamer at times, but I'm certainly not the head in the clouds, away with the fairies type character you see on 16 Personalities.
‚Ä¢ I have anger issues which I find impossible to control - the reason I mention this is I've even posted in the INFP sub about it - questioning how I can be so full of anger as one
‚Ä¢ I'm not a GREAT writer (many INFPs are)
‚Ä¢ I'm a web designer (saw a post mentioning designers here)

isfp,"* She's reserved and private, but wants to open up more easily. She isn't comfortable expressing how she feels unless she has a close connection with you. Although she keeps many issues to herself and appears perfect on the outside to people who aren't in her inner circle, she gets annoyed internally when people perceive her life as smooth and great. She also switches between wanting to share more of her life with others, but not wanting them to know the more personal stuff because they don't deserve to know unless they're deemed as one of her loved ones. 
* A lot of people misjudge her as boring or snobbish because she's not super talkative and is really selective about who she allows to follow her on social media or how much time she invests in people. For example, she's a terrible texter and will take hours or days to reply if she doesn't care for you.
* She wears a lot of makeup, dyes her hair, and dresses up slightly more than others (thigh boots for example). She has a great eye for aesthetics and also a great ear for music. I wouldn't call her shallow or vain at all, but she does care about aesthetics to a certain degree.
* One of the most important things to her in life is romance and intimacy with a significant other; she cares for having a special bond with someone who she can feel comfortable sharing her emotions with. A life goal she has is also to travel the world with the love of her life, so they can both grow together. She enjoys traveling in general, but she's pretty adamant about traveling with her one soulmate.
* Some of her biggest flaws: confirmation bias, moodiness, and difficulty letting things/people go. She gets attached to memories and feelings, and she values loyalty which makes it even harder for her to let people go. 
* She's extremely good at reading people and telling what their motives are. She easily picks up on others' vibes and can get a feel of their personality. She can be quite judgmental if she gets a bad vibe from you. However she almost never draws conclusions; she'll consider different possibilities about a person's motive, but never act like she must be correct.
* She's mostly past and future-oriented; she likes taking trips down memory lane, but loves fantasizing what her ideal future life will be like. She also worries about the future pretty often and gets anxious easily.
* She's a slight perfectionist who sets pretty high standards and expectations for herself, especially because her dad compares her to her older sister all the time. Although she's a perfectionist and is hardworking, she's sort of a procrastinator.
* She's constantly trying to learn from her past mistakes and grow from them. Sometimes she gets tempted to repeat past mistakes such as self-harm when feeling really upset, but she tries hard to resist.
* She's very prone to depression when things are going bad in her life. She's been depressed and suicidal twice already and did try to commit once, but failed. She feels things really strongly.
* At times, she can be stubborn about what she wants. For example, all her friends and family will give her the same advice. She'll consider it, but still end up doing what her heart wants anyway even if she knows she should be listening to her loved ones.
* She's not comfortable with unfamiliar situations because she finds it easier if she knows what to expect instead of throwing herself out there and potentially embarrassing herself.
* She's really easy to get along with and pretty indecisive, so you can usually get everything your way if you're with her. 
* Some of her biggest pet peeves are self-centered, superficial people who are insensitive and close-minded. She also hates people who fake their personality, interests, and behavior just to fit in with popular people or to be liked. 
* Some of her interests include stargazing, writing (poetry, journaling), reading (romance, angst, dark themes like serial killers etc), photography, drawing, and Netflix (thrillers, crime, mystery). She also enjoys playing volleyball and was on the team in middle and high school, but she also gets tired easily since she's a pretty low energy person. She sort of likes raves (mainly for the music and lights), but usually just goes sometimes because her friends want her to. She hates the crowd.
* Strong tendency to go into a self-destructive mode when things are rough in her life. She uses drugs as her vice to cope. She also can get quite impulsive at times if she's feeling emotional.
* She's a big pushover with social anxiety, and is really shy but tries not to let people know.",1589181431

So im an infj and the most ill go for a friend would be a few hours of playing a game or maybe just sitting around to talk for a few hours. Anything more and my batteries are dead.

I have an isfp girl as a friend who pretty much spends 95% of their time around me (long distance) when she isnt busy working. The main question is how far can an isfp go for a friendship without getting attached?

Ill go into detail.

- we text all day
- when we arent texting she explains why we arent (sorry for the slow replies, im ""x"" )
-we play games for hours straight, yesterday 16 hours straight
- i read her to sleep some nights, we sleep on mic sometimes
- i sometimes wake up to appreciation texts
- she says im perfect and im too good to her. ""holy fuck i am never letting u go ever. i will annoy you till the end of the earth cause time and time again you have proved you really are the best friend i have had. and ur a perfect human being""
- we make long term promises ( i called her personality addictive, she called mine too, we promised to ""not break the addiction"")

""Hey op, ur an idiot, isnt it clear""... well yes... and no...
She still calls me her best friend ever which i avoid the word friend when im into people. She sometimes jokes about bringing stuff up on my wedding day. Also using the [casually explained](https://youtu.be/xa-4IAR_9Yw) philosophy, she could just be the nicest person ever but maybe also just needs a life distraction.

Soooo again the main question is, could you as an isfp seriously have a friend THIS close and think ""wow, i have such a good friend, they are like a brother!"" I personally could never spend this much time with someone forever and only think of them as a friend since its not something i could do while being taken. However im totally fine with being friends. It just seems like a bit of an extreme. I havent personally just been doing this just to date, its mostly because i have strong feelings and being around helps satisfy these feelings

Im just super afraid to lose my friendship because this person is the best person ive ever met in my life.

Little did I know that this has a lot to do with the challenge that a task presents, as well as my ability to undertake that task. I‚Äôve realized that the sweet spot where you tend to reach your flow is when your skills are fully involved in overcoming a suitable challenge.

If you‚Äôre wondering how you can attempt to enter a state of flow with whatever you‚Äôre working on, this is what has helped me.

1. Eliminate Distractions (Both Internally and Externally)
2. Avoid Multitasking

4. Have a Clear Outcome or Goal in Mind

isfp,"This is something I've been thinking about for some time and today I've reached a point where I want guidance by you guys about this.
Me (intj) and my ISFP partner have been through a fair number of thicks and things alongside each other and there was one thing I noticed.. I show (?) more care for them than they do for me, like health and whatever bad they're going through, I give them utmost support be it emotionally or otherwise, I listen to their issues ane usually sort them out and counsel them. Those situations make me and them feel like I'm the caretaker and the parent and they're the child.

 Objectively, they're also fairly.. Should I say childish and idealistic? Impractical. Very imaginative and nearly nothing concrete to do in life, for which I mostly make up by being very practical and by their definition; a bit pessimistic.
Now I wouldn't rant about it had it only been this stuff but recently I've noticed that anytime I let them know I'm going through anything terrible, they don't really offer me anything. I do believe they love me because I've noticed it over the years but this behaviour everytime I'm going through shit they're practically.. Absent? It's like they don't care. They would listen to me rant but I'd receive no real connection other than silently holding me and stuff, also if I react out of panic etc they make me feel even shittier by making me feel misunderstood, the problem might be me idrk. Recently I've come to believe they'd never make me feel held or accepted so I wonder if this adds to other signs of us not being a good pair.

Sorry this was too long, **tl;dr** my partner loves me otherwise but doesn't make me feel accepted or well cared for especially in bad times. They're there but also not there, I hope you intuitively get it. 

I write this to let my feelings out and to get some advice from other ISFPs, is this how you guys generally react, not knowing what to say or do and just silently being there for your partner? Because if so, I don't think I'd like that in the long run.",1588862247

He seems keyed up and needs to talk, but I also get the sense he's not saying what's really bothering him, he's just talking about other things that are less emotional but in an emotional way.  He usually seems to feel better at the end of our conversations.  As far as I can tell, it's not a specific reaction to what I'm saying, more like a shift in mood.

Is he feeling upset and just trying to feel better rather than telling me directly what's wrong or venting?

I'm always the one that is asking to do something with them, instead of them asking me. It makes me feel like I'm bothering them, getting in the way, or being annoying. 

I also have a really hard time connecting with people on a deeper level. All of my friends know each other really well and are able to have really good conversations, while I'm over in the corner being awkward and quiet. My occasional attempts at participating in conversations either don't get heard or are completely ignored. At the same time though, when my input is asked for, I won't be able to explain myself or I just won't have anything to say. It makes me want to crawl in a hole and die. And its not like I'm boring to be around either. I love going out to do cool or new stuff, I'll never shy away from a challenge, I have fun ideas, I'm goofy as hell, etc.  

The last time I had a best friend who also considered me her best friend was in 6th grade. Ever since then I've mostly been by myself (except for dating).

isfp,"Hello everyone :) I‚Äôve posted on this subreddit so many times, so much that I think I may have lost a part of myself in releasing so much of myself to MBTI. I find the system beautiful and intriguing and compelling, yet at the same time it causes constant tumult inside of me and I cannot help but wonder who I am. I feel that I may have blinded myself too deeply in the cognitive functions and type theory that I‚Äôve neglected and veiled the true girl inside. I will try to unleash my insecurities and fully release myself and hope that these words can shine a light on the truth of who I am, or who I could be. I will try to tell my story and how I see the world and hopefully they carry me (and could illuminate the functions I use). Thank you in advance to whoever can help me, you are wonderful :)

I‚Äôve been feeling like an endless seeker lately, constantly wandering through my mind and the world in search of who I am. I feel lost and dying and at the same time, growing and evolving. I think what captures me the most is the eternal hope I feel inside of me. Even on the coldest of nights and darkest moments I feel a flame whispering inside of me, a truth, a belief that goodness can and will find me, even in the depths of sorrow and hopelessness, I can rise from any pain or heartbreak. Sometimes I feel like my hope is all that I have. When I fall or lose myself or hurt others, the beaming feeling of tomorrow inside of me rescues me from utter downfall. I‚Äôm now a senior in high school, and my feelings feel almost invisible and strange, sometimes it‚Äôs difficult to tell how exactly I feel. Sometimes I ache when I think about the girl that I was, so young and on the verge of a beautiful journey, and I miss Freshman year, the way school felt when I was still so pure, still hadn‚Äôt discovered so much of myself. I miss all the friendships I could have had and all the stories that became folded inside of me. I miss it so. Sometimes it feels so long ago. Other times, I feel no nostalgia at all, simply hollow. Sometimes the future feels so near and I feel like I‚Äôm on a conveyor belt, other times time feels like a figment of nothingness. What recently struck me, and felt so strange, was that I felt a surging fear when I thought of the future. It was odd to me because as a child the future fascinated me. I always loved to imagine who I could be and the life I could have. I was never daunted by the path ahead, only entranced. But when I was reflecting about it earlier today, I felt a surge of butterflies. It was so constricting. I come from an asian family that places high importance on career paths. I was at first excited and understood where they came from, and although I felt a little uneasy from committing to one specific path in the future, I still was excited that I could pursue my fascination with psychology and become a child psychiatrist, that I could unlock the beautiful minds and potential of young children who feel like I once felt as a child. But lately I‚Äôve begun to feel the pressing reality of school and it‚Äôs lost its charm to me. I used to love to learn, found a sheer fascination with the world and loved to discover more, but now I‚Äôve begun to feel so out of touch and empty. I want to love the future, to wander down the path of what could be with hope and joy and truth but it doesn‚Äôt feel the same, with the brimming uncertainty of the virus and life spiraling awry, it feels so strange and daunting. Daunting. I‚Äôd always never understood when people found the future daunting, I always saw it as rosy and dusted with promise but now I understand. It almost hurts.
As a child I felt so foreign to the girl that I am today. Even though I am only 17 now, the child inside of me feels so lost, like she left me a long time ago. I used to be quite out of touch with the world, always floating to my own tide. I loved to discover what I loved. I loved to find a sense of wonder in mud and how it can turn to clay, in Greek mythology, the Romanovs, praying mantises. I loved to feel swept by the magic of learning and whatever piqued me. I was considered a very weird child. I always felt like the world against me, I saw other children as monsters waiting to ensnare me, so I hissed at them. Looking back, it feels a little funny and also sad-I could have paved so many beautiful relationships and learned how to interact with others but I never felt comfortable with doing so. I did feel a deep thirst for love, deep down though. When I found a friend they were forever stamped in my heart. I loved them so much and loved to discuss anything with them. While pin quiet in the classroom, with my closest friends and families I would ramble forever, liberating my tongue to my mother‚Äôs torment. I was very comfortable with adults and my curiosity would seize me to the extent that I asked thousands of questions and made stories about the ideal life I had-all of which seem strange in hindsight (that I buried a hope diamond in my backyard and my mother was a famous actress from Paris). When I wrote stories I always preferred to embellish them in my own way, not remaining completely true to life. I had an obsession with ballet that lasted for a while. I remember getting entranced by the music and the stories, my heart flooding with emotion, and dancing with all of my being. I was surprisingly elegant and devoted my entire self to it, even though I was incredibly clumsy and lacked motor coordination in other areas, to the extent that I needed extra physical therapy. That slowly began to fizzle out, however, when I discovered the world of writing and poetry, still my home. Even though I had grown and naturally found promise in the world of music (I am a naturally talented singer, although terrible at playing instruments technically) it never felt true to me. 


With words, I feel so alive, I feel that I can carve out infinite worlds and journeys and never remain empty. They heal me and fill me with hope. In middle school, I was a mess. I...was finding myself in superficiality and drama. I still felt secretly that I never belonged to the world but I think that deep down I wished that I could, to the extent that I gossiped (mainly fictional stories) and treated others terribly. I became a tad obsessed with appearance and fashion, I loved vintage clothes and applied some awful makeup that still seems ghastly to me. It still aches and sometimes I wish I could bury myself in the shadows forever, but I always escape. I always feel taunted by who I was and I‚Äôm trying to embrace myself but it‚Äôs so difficult. I‚Äôve asked forgiveness but I still feel forever marked by that darkness. I‚Äôve begun to see it as beautiful, as instrumental to my growth, but I still regret the girl that I was (and I secretly worry could still be). In high school, I‚Äôm not sure who I‚Äôve become. I feel like a constant paradox-lovely and kind but nast and bitter and growing and falling and dark and light. I feel tangled in a need for growth. When I entered high school I was extremely opinionated, I loved to debate about issues such as abortion and religion and proudly embraced my viewpoint, even though now I feel a little harsh. I slowly began to open my mind and my heart and as I grew in my faith I felt myself unravel and transform-I find it beautiful because as a child I had always felt drawn to butterflies, and now I have begun to metamorphosize. I fell in love with learning and discovering more about the world, stories and ideas, and witnessing just how amazing every individual can be. My fears and hatred thawed and I love fiercely now. I fell in love with a few fictional characters (Sydney Carton, particularly, because his sheer empathy touched me) and real humans and I have grown and felt renewed through them. I feel awakened now, in a lovely way. I have grown through my writing and sharing and being vulnerable-sometimes I worry that my words will fade and that I could lose myself but I keep unveiling myself, keep giving myself to the stars and letting the, illuminate my constellations and clinging to the hope inside. My search for myself in MBTI has been an obsessive one and still exists since Sophomore year. Sometimes it feels too intoxicating and I think that, in time, I might try to find myself in new ways, but it still utterly grips me and I feel the need to keep exploring who I could be. I‚Äôve begun to feel different petals of who I am open and while it‚Äôs frightening it‚Äôs also intriguing. I still want to understand who I truly am and so here I am, pouring myself in the hopes that I can learn more about who I am.

isfp,"So my younger sister is an ISFP, and I don‚Äôt rly understand her. I love asking questions and am extremely curious abt everything. She doesn‚Äôt seem to be curious and try to understand everything (which is completely understandable). 

However this applies to herself as well. She‚Äôs a high school senior and doesn‚Äôt seem to enjoy thinking about her major or what her dream job would be. I came up with a huge list of majors that could lead to jobs she would enjoy, but she told me she doesn‚Äôt enjoy thinking about it. 

If I have a conversation with her I‚Äôll ask her something along the lines of what was her inspiration for her latest art piece or what music she has been listening to lately (she loves sketching/painting/music). She never seems to share a reason. 

Whenever we can have a conversation, it‚Äôs usually just me talking abt something I‚Äôm passionate abt and her listening intently. She‚Äôs told me that she likes listening over talking. 

Maybe this isn‚Äôt an ISFP thing and it‚Äôs just us, but how can I hold a meaningful conversation with her.",1588748284

isfp,"Hi everyone! I'm Derek (ENTJ). My friends and I just recently launched an MBTI based dating app called Boo, but have gotten thousands of sign ups already. After much tweaking, we finally wanted to share this with you in the hopes that this may help you find like-minded friends and loved ones.

We felt like current dating apps were really inefficient. They help you meet more people, not more of the right people. This means wasted time, money, and emotional preparation on bad dates with no chemistry. It's not just bad dates; the time and effort from swiping, messaging, arranging dates, and preparing both emotionally and physically, just for dates to continuously not work out, has led to dating fatigue and the sense that online dating is hopeless. It's also hard to tell what a person is actually like through text, only to be disappointed after meeting or the first month of dating.

What we as MBTI enthusiasts have always known is that who we are (personality type) tends to influence the kinds of people we're attracted to, and it doesn't make sense for this not to play a part in mainstream online dating.

We wanted to create a radically authentic, transparent, and empathetic dating experience where people can feel free to be themselves, because it is exactly by being yourself that the right person will come along and like and appreciate you for who you naturally are. On Boo, if someone matched with you, they‚Äôre already aware of your best and worst traits, and still decided they‚Äôd rather have you over any other type. On Boo, you‚Äôre already what each other are looking for.

As an ISFP, you have a natural gift for the arts. You're creative, artistic, spontaneous, and spiritual. But at your worst, you can be highly sensitive, indecisive, unpredictable, and poor long term planners. You‚Äôll want someone who sees the world as you do and loves you for your best, but also understands and forgives you at your worst, and would have it no other way. 

Our app is completely free, and you can download on

isfp,"Hi fellow ISFPs, 

I need to vent a little and I hope it's ok to do so here, in the hopes that someone has some advice or is going (has gone) through a similar situation... 

So, I'm almost 30, beginning of last year I finally quit my job as a data analyst which I did for about 4 years. I studied business administration and information management. Last year was supposed to be a year of figuring things out, what to do next. I did a yoga teacher training, I worked as a waitress/bartender, started work at a cafe, giving english classes at a language school and worked as a counsellor at a kids summer camp. (Also moved countries in the process). So A LOT of new things, a lot of social situations, LOTS of out-of-comfortzone things, but many good things :) 

With corona, my waitress/bartender/yoga/cafe/english teaching jobs have all been cancelled - I'm giving a couple of virtual yoga classes a week and that's about it. So now that I can't do any of these things that kept me extremely busy I'm second guessing all my choices, thinking that it is probably time I start thinking about some stability for the future as being a freelancer in all these things is so insecure (although I guess people with full-time positions have a similar experience right now). 

I get iffy just thinking about going back to doing data analysis, which I know there are probably lots of online jobs available at the moment... and sometimes I have these thoughts that I have this masters' degree and that I should use it instead of ""just"" working in a cafe. But honestly I just enjoy hanging out there, making coffee and pretty milk patterns, welcoming people in the cafe and doing work that does NOT involve too much thinking. 

I'm struggling also with the thought about going back to study something - I honestly have so many things I could see myself doing! Physiotherapy (interested in the body, goes along with yoga), medical technical assisstant, mechanical engineering (i regret never having followed physics after high school) though I can't imagine 3 years of study (again) and working on the side to put myself through it. - And again, seeing myself as being more of a doer than a thinker so why on earth would I go back to school. 

I also make jewelry - self taught silversmith here! And I could totally be making some stuff and selling online. But I have like zero motivation or inspiration right now. 

Ok so I'm definitely caught in a loop right now. Things are generally good, I'm an optimistic, cheerful person - it's just this area of my life that I'm never sure about. And I'm usually sure of myself going with the flow (e.g. working in a cafe and loving it!!) until someone asks me what I'm gonna do in the future to support myself. NO clue about pension and all that jazz, makes me anxious to think about how I will provide for myself down the line.

So, to whoever is still reading, I salute you. THANK YOU for taking the time and I would seriously appreciate a word of encouragement or a smile or something. Or not. Hehe. But I'm grateful that you took the time to read regardles. :)",1588619924

Examples would be like, I‚Äôm folding laundry downstairs and my daughter announces from upstairs, that she‚Äôs going to the bathroom. (She‚Äôs bad about giving me a running blow-by-blow of her activities for some reason.) So I‚Äôll be like, ‚ÄúCool story, bro.‚Äù and then she laughs and realizes what she said was unnecessary.

Another time she said she wanted to watch *Pan‚Äôs Labyrinth* because her father had told her ‚Äúit‚Äôs about an elf in a maze‚Äù when she asked him about it. I said, ‚ÄúSure, we can rent it but you‚Äôll never be able to sleep again..‚Äù (For context, she thinks the *Are you Afraid of the Dark* episode featuring Bobcat Goldthwait as the sandman popping out from under the bed, is the most terrifying thing she‚Äôs ever seen.)

Anyway she started trying to argue with me about it so instead of trying to convince her I was like, ‚ÄúSure! Let‚Äôs do it. I‚Äôll pop some popcorn, let‚Äôs fire this bad boy up and watch a nice family movie. C‚Äômon everybody! (dumb kid) wants to have a movie day!‚Äù

She immediately became suspicious and tried to back out but I made her sit through the trailer at least just so she‚Äôd know not to waste my time with back talk.

I hadn't really considered the way I see and feel certain things to be an anomaly before, but I realized I may have some aspects of synesthesia after reading a few articles giving advice for individuals struggling with the math section of the GREs.

I've tried to catalogue some of the things I think of differently here, but many of them are a bit abstract:

Odd numbers are cool, even numbers are warm, and prime numbers are sharp;
All of the months have their own color and sometimes their own scent or temperature;
Days of the week each have a vibe (examples of this are Saturday is empty but in a good way with a sun in the sky, but Sunday is empty in a bad way and the sun is setting but there aren't any sunset colors)....

I think I didn't consider myself any more of a synesthete than the next person because I was only aware of auditory synesthesia, but now I'm realizing that I've struggled to do math for so long because the stupid numbers are practically playing hot and cold on the page and in my head. Oh, and 73 is stabbing the number line, which is just great -- and that's not to even talk about 0 which is just a hole in the paper.

Anyways, long rant over, but I'd love to hear y'all's thoughts!",1588574506

isfp,"Well, first of all I'm just gonna say that I was writing a long ish post here to ask you guys whether I'm INFP or ISFP, since I've been having a lot of trouble deciding and would often go back and forth second guessing and thinking ""Oh I'm INFP! Wait no, what if I'm actually ISFP?"" and the opposite as well so it was an endless cycle lol. 

But then, when I was writing the post, I realized most of the things I thought that didn't make me feel like an ISFP and more like INFP were because of a little bit of social anxiety and adhd.. So you know, things like really bad memory, hard time finishing a task, a lot of second guessing, bad at socializing, really anxious and not calm and laid back nature unlike most ISFPs, etc. 

So yeah I actually realized I may have adhd through that.. Even told my sister about it and she said ""You're just now realizing that? It's very obvious"" üò≠

Anyways I wanted to ask a few questions so if y'all don't mind, I'd appreciate some answers! 


‚Ä¢ Are there any of you that don't really feel like an adventurer?

I know it's lowkey like an ISFP stereotype, but I was reading the cognitive functions and I guess it'd make sense why. But I wouldn't consider myself an adventurer, at all, lol. On the other hand, I do fit the artist stereotype, although I'm more of a consumer of art rather than a creator of it (well, I lowkey am a creator too when it comes to designs I think, but I also don't wanna overestimate myself so üòÖ)

‚Ä¢ What are your enneagram types? 

I still don't know which one would be mine, I've made a few tests and one said I was 4w5 and the other said 9w1 so.. JDJSHJS 

‚Ä¢ Do you ever get annoyed by the descriptions that sensors get online and all the tests that have intuitive bias? 

This annoys me so much to the point that I just wanna start my own pretty website related to MBTI and the cognitive functions and create a test that's actually accurate.. If I ever do that it'd be ironic coming from me though, since I mistyped myself multiple times accidentally HDJSJS 

‚Ä¢ What kind of music do you like and are any of you into pop culture? 

By pop culture I don't mean only music wise, but just.. You know, pop culture in general! 

‚Ä¢ Do you ever get a little bit annoyed by other sensor types, despite being a sensor too? 

I've had issues with my dad, who's a sensor too I think (ISTP I'm pretty sure), because he will refuse to humor me when I ask him about hypothetical situations. Of course not all sensors do this, it's just that specific case.

* Ever since I was a child I‚Äôve had a tendency to see the world through deeper and insightful meaning. What I mean by this is that I never fit into with people my age because I wanted meaningful relationships and I always saw music and movies with rose colored glasses seeing the meaningfulness behind things. The first thing I noticed that I developed as a child was the ability to feel and care deeply. I wrote poetry and my thoughts on paper at an early time.
* As I started getting older I found myself becoming really engaged in sensory activities. I found myself extremely passionate towards riding a motorbike, I loved the feeling of waterskiing and things that allowed me to live in the moment and have fun. This eventually translated in me developing a big passion for singing, painting and dancing. 
* I‚Äôm really outgoing and love to say hi to everyone that I see around. I tend to plaster a warm smile on my face and I like to appear charming and confident. I have a tendency to be witty, cunning, and brotherly. I feel most myself when I‚Äôm able to be social with everyone however there have been moments when I don‚Äôt feel the people around me are ‚Äògood people‚Äô so I shut down and become private and withdrawn.
* I sometimes feel alienated by other people when I express myself. I understand everyone else‚Äôs feelings but I have strong difficulty trusting people with my own and I tend to feel disappointed by other people often.
* When I walk in a room, I‚Äôm always thinking about how I can fit in and connect with everyone. I like to feel a part of the group and I never talk about myself instead preferring talking about others and making them feel good. 
* I can be logical when I need to be, in fact I‚Äôve tested as a thinker in the past because I think I want to be. Whenever there‚Äôs a problem, I always go online and research things to imperfect something by using established methods. I can be bossy and organized when I want to be. I like to be in charge of my projects and I find myself being able to perfect things to my desire. I feel uncomfortable stating my opinions on things without facts. I need to have backup reasons for my political opinions and I oftentimes feel unprepared to discuss things like this without prior memory of things that I use as facts.  
* People oftentimes feel confused by me. People say my eyes often go dull and look existential as I gaze out. People oftentimes say they can never read how I feel and it makes them feel disconnected from me even if I‚Äôm acting happy. 
* When I‚Äôm unhealthy I become detached and can be a bully. I become a loner who doesn‚Äôt care what others think and doesn‚Äôt care about being destructive and tend to wear darker clothes as a way to express myself. Luckily I got out of this phase. When I‚Äôm unhealthy I tend to worry about the future and feel like I‚Äôm trapped in an inescapable future where things turn out terribly.
* I have a hard time expecting my flaws. I don‚Äôt know who I am, and I tend to wear a lot of masks and fake my behavior to make me seem more attractive to other people. I tend to drown in my feelings oftentimes as well and since I fake my outward exterior I never can accept help. 
* I oftentimes have a relaxed and ‚Äòout of touch‚Äô yet affable and warm hearted demeanor. I‚Äôve made an effort to appear tougher and more strong hearted and strong willed as I‚Äôve gotten older to protect myself and to project more attractiveness.",1588475268

unlike their INFP cousins (available in the same product line-up, you will be given a discount code if you manage to keep your ISFP)

Instead, observe their actions to figure out what they live for. üîç

Some ISFPs choose art to express their values. üé®üéπ

Others are found in sports stadiums or EMS vehicles. üèüüö®

Not just haughty fine art or classical music! 

Although ISFPs are perfectly capable of those endeavors, they care not for fame or external validation. So they will choose any art that speaks to them.

For example, you may find your ISFP in your local hair salon, gardening company, EDM nightclub, or police station graffitiing its walls. üíáüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüßëüèª‚Äçüåæüë©üèø‚Äçüíªüßëüèæ‚Äçüé®üë®üèª‚Äçüç≥üíÖüèº

**Extraverted Sensing (Se)** üëÅüëÇüèºüëÉüèºüëÑüëÜüèº

This is how your ISFP interacts with the world (and you)! üë¶üèªüíûüåèüë¶üèº

A healthy ISFP lives in the here and now. This is a quality that pleases many spiritual gurus (who are mostly suffering intuitives)

Mindfulness comes equipped at birth! üå∏üòå

Your ISFPs will be good at dancing, rock-climbing, and any physical activities. üï∫üèªüèäüèæü§Ωüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüöµüö£üèΩüßóüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

They will be the first to feel the first raindrop of the season, first spring sunshine after a long winter, and the first sniff of a burning dinner. üåß‚òÄÔ∏èüåàüî•üôÄ

They live here, now. So, if they don't messageüì±you, it does not mean they stopped caring. You simply stopped existing! So message them first or better, go to their door and knock! They will greet you with a child-like wide smile because you just became alive again!

**Introverted Intuition (Ni)** üîÆ

Your ISFP may seem gullible, but that is just them keeping a low profile. üòâüòèü§´

Hidden beneath the na√Øve-child-like fa√ßade, lurks the creepy investigator, Ni. üëª

*Ni protec* üè∞üôÇ

your ISFP, from incoming dangers or shitty people

*but Ni also atac* üî™‚òπÔ∏è

your ISFP, especially when their life is shitty (which is sadly often)

it gets blown out of proportion, silencing Se, because Ni be like:

&gt;Se got us here so imma punch him and be in charge üò§

Your ISFP will then start playing INFJ and try to predict the future all the time üé≠üî≠

You can tell if they are an INFJ or a broken ISFP by checking these points ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ

- what are their predictions about? an INFJ will have a neutral outlook on the future. a malfunctioning ISFP will have Apocalypse: the Movie playing 24/7 in their head. all their hunches will be about incoming doom

&gt;i wanna go camping but what if a bear eats me üêª

&gt;i wanna get a boyfriend but what if he's an ENTP ü§™üòà

and so on

- how accurate are their ""prophecies""? INFJs' are accurate (90% come-true rate) broken ISFPs' are ‚Ä¶ a joke (10% on a ""good"" day) ‚≠ïÔ∏è‚ùå

- do they plan? INFJs will meticulously plan their today and tomorrow. An ISFP pretending to be INFJ will still do whatever the fuck they want all the time randomly and spontaneously üõπü•£ü•ÉüèÉüèªüï∫üèªü§≥üèæüñïüèºüëÆüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§úüèºüëÆüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

If they are an INFJ, walk away because they creepy and needy ü§óü•¥üòçü•∞üòòü•¥

If they are your dear ISFP friend, walk with them to the nearest mountain or beach. ‚õ∞üèù

Don't talk about cringy intuitive stuff like philosophy or MBTI ü§ê

Instead, guide their attention to the breeze, leaves, birds, overcast, orange sunshine on the said overcast, sea scent, decomposing-damp-leaves scent üå¨üçÉüçÇüïäüå´üå¶üêö

When it starts to drizzle, strip and have passionate straight/gay/etc sex according to your various orientations and identifications üòèüòâüôÉüë©‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüë®üë©‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüë©üë®‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüë®üë©‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüíã‚Äçüë®üë©‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüíã‚Äçüë©üë®‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüíã‚Äçüë®üõå

&gt;drizzle on you üåß

&gt;sand/leaves under you üåäüçÇ

Now their Se is back on! You fixed your ISFP! ü•≥üéäüéâ

or if they worship Satan or run around the planet photographing UFOs üëΩü§ñüõ∏üöÄ

**Extraverted Thinking (Te)** üî®üí£ü™ìüî™üß®

Uh-oh. 

We got to the dark part. I will be brief. I don't like this place. üò±

Your ISFP will be chill and live-let-live/let-it-be/laid-back and all that cool guy and gal stuff you know üòé

Until you activate their Te ü§Ø

It is the last resort. It puts your ISFP into a berserk stake. They lose their conscious mind and turns into a blur ‚ö°Ô∏èüèÉüèª and

&gt;massacres bullies ‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è

isfp,"Let‚Äôs say someone wrongs you. (Lies, steals, cheats, something like that.) 

You are initially open to forgiving this person, because maybe the circumstances were unusual or your own intentions had been unclear, whatever.

So you clear the air. You directly lay out what you found offensive and why. 

Now the person has all the information they need to either (A) fix the problem, by making an active effort to undo the damage they‚Äôve done and earn back your trust or (B) decide the relationship isn‚Äôt worth salvaging and continue to do nothing. 

The way I see it, those are the only two options.

So I randomly had the idea to look up his company and see what former employees had to say. I‚Äôm a little shocked because there were more than a few reviews left about my father and how difficult and unfair of a manager he is. I‚Äôm kind of shocked but not really shocked.

isfp,"I heard that ISFPs don't like words to communication and I'm here to know what's your thoughts about this.

&amp;#x200B;

When I'm on tertiary Ni loops I use the logical thinking in order to test as many possibilities as I can to find the correct meaning and implications of my situation based on the big picture of my whole experience and reality around me. Preference for syllogism. It happens when both my core values and knowledge sources that I have can't find the correct answer for a moral problem. That is, when I am confused and in doubt.

&amp;#x200B;

On my inferior Te grips, especially when someone acts against my values, I prefer not to communicate. Because I am aware of what is happening. I mean, I need TO BE SURE about me and about what's happening on the involved ones. Then, concrete actions.

&amp;#x200B;

I hate poetry from the bottom of my heart. I don't have patience with musics with vocals (the instrumentals are the best on my humble opinion). I need to send always the correct message about my feelings and values, avoiding writing/talking but when I do, it's better to be a grammar dictator (with my primary language that''s not English) than being imprecise/poetic.

&amp;#x200B;

So, it's a game based on the edges. Black and White about words. And you ISFPs? If there's a common pattern like what's happen with me, what's the relationship with cognitive functions? It's because my Te? What's the cognitive path for poetry (if there's one)? Thanks!

Because of these mutual interests, we started DMing over FB and now we talk every day via text and/or phone call. So far things have gone well because I initiated direct communication from the get-go which means that each of us are comfortable telling the other when we need space. That said, home-skillet is incredibly laid back and in result, I generally find myself leading the conversation...which isn't always easy for an array of reasons, but I enjoy to some extent. Home-Skillet is hands-on-smart; he can build things I could never dream of building IRL, but he isn't intellectual, which is cool since we have a shared history (mutual friend group in HS and similar lifestyles) because we can talk about old friends or memories and what-have-you...but there's only so many stories I can hear about persons XY&amp;Z. He's actually much more interested in my complex ideas than I ever expected; and, he is a good sport about entertaining me while I try to explain the context of an idea which can sometimes take forever. He always offers his own opinion, and if he doesn't understand what I've said, he's always OK asking me to re-phrase. And this is great. But sometimes after I unload an idea, the conversation just stalls. He doesn't give very deep responses, just kind of speaks in generalities about why he agrees or disagrees (which I do appreciate, actually, but do tend to counter), and then things die down.

isfp,"Hi! It's Lou (ESFJ) and Jess (INFP) here. We're two sisters who have recently set up a dating app and website based on Myers-Briggs personality types called So Syncd. 

The app has only just become available in the app stores (iOS and Android), but we've had thousands of sign ups already.

Firstly, we wanted to let you know about it because we thought it might be of interest. We've had lots of people get in touch to say they are having some amazing conversations and they've never connected with such great people on a dating app. Most people aren't meeting up in person at the moment due to coronavirus, and of course, safety comes first, but the app usage has gone through the roof as people get to know each other better online and make meaningful connections.

Secondly, we are refining the UI/UX at the moment and we'd really appreciate any feedback (either on here or at [hello@sosyncd.com](mailto:hello@sosyncd.com)).

It's free to sign up and it only takes a couple of minutes to do so, if you know your personality type already, which you guys obviously do!

A girl who is an ISFP and I (ENTJ here) went out on 3 dates. On our 3rd date, we had sex, but when she found out that I was a virgin, she told me that she wasn‚Äôt looking for anything exclusive, but still wanted to sleep with me. Oddly enough, her actions tell me BOTH: 

Pros:

1. She cuddles with me, BEAR hugged me a few times for 10 seconds straight, and grabs me sometimes like she‚Äôs all proud that you‚Äôre mine. 

2. We had sex.

3. She told me that she likes me over text about a week after we had sex.  

Cons:

1. After we had sex, she started to be flakey ALL the time. 

\- Her texts were always being half assed, and she never calls me back when I call her. I usually call or text every 3 ‚Äì 4 days and this flakey behavior has continued for about a month. 

\- She told me that she has been a little depressed and due to the Coronavirus, the timing is all bad, and although I understand this, why is she always being half assed with me? I want to at least hear her voice, but she won't even do this....

2. The final straw came yesterday when she said she was free and I asked her what time, but she never responded.

Analysis:

I‚Äôve been told ISFPs in general are terrible at texting EVEN with their romantic partners, but my belief is that no matter what type of personality type you have, you would always get back to someone close to you. My counter to this belief is that we haven‚Äôt gone out or gotten to know each other enough to establish a ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù just yet. We may both like each other, but that doesn‚Äôt mean we‚Äôre official. 

Oddly enough, I feel that she‚Äôs telling me the truth about everything, but her actions are telling me a different story. I spoke with men and women far more experienced than I, and almost all of them concur that she does like me, but then why act so half assed all the time? 

At this point, I‚Äôm not going to be contacting her anymore. I‚Äôve tried to be understanding and patient, but I‚Äôve done enough. If she wants to talk, she can call or text me first. I have to move on. Nevertheless, what are your thoughts?",1587752446

isfp,"WARNING!! very long rant

At first I thought he was an ENTP because he has very controversial views on what society ought to be and said he loves to triggers people.
But I was speaking to him this night and he admitted to me he hate arguing because he doesn't know how to answer to people that voice different opinions than him. I am an Intp, I don't play nice when I say the truth, especially to my friends. I said to him he was a dishonest person that doesn't protect his boundaries and that is why he hates people and doesn't respect women (it is also because of a former relationship of his). He needs to respect more himself and stop acting like an hypocrite to makes his life easier when interacting with others.
And then he got super triggered but he refused to be mad, said he just wanted to be nice and that others are being mean to him for no reasons and he want to live alone (except for women that he tricks into relationships that leads nowhere). It just makes no sense, it is like he has no sense of self-reflection. I was saying that I am saying the truth because I worry about him and I want him to have self respect, he just doesn't get it and thinks I am trying to manipulate him to satisfy my own ego. He did not say that but he implied it by saying I was toxic, just like narcissistic people. And he doubts the intentions of everyone, it is like he doesn't believe people can be genuine in their intentions and everyone plays each other for selfish goal and that is why he does the same with women. 
Now it seems to makes sense he is an Isfp. I am sorry for the stereotypes but he is a musician, has a very good fashion sense and likes to experiment. He also has very good observation skills and is easily distracted by stuff going around when I speak to him. He lives at his mom's house but he also trades stock market like crazy and really wish he could become a millionaire by doing this. Of course he does it mostly for the thrill and when he wins he lose it all some time after. He has precise ideas for his future and yet live lives day to day without plans. He doesn't even have a real job and prefer sketchy non official jobs. 

It was the first time I managed to have a genuine disagreement with him, because the mad lad never voices his opinions if he is ""too afraid"" others won't like it and fears they will make fun of him cause he doesn't know how to speak (according to him). But the man also do poetry and speak better than me. At the end I just gave up, I am still hopefull because he said he would consider the message I was telling him and not my intentions behind it.

\- Feeling is natural to me. I'd rather feel something than be empty. And I always know what I'm feeling. I see a situation and the first thing that I think about is how I feel. I usually see situations by putting myself or someone I'm close to in that situation that's being described. 

\- I love expressing emotions. If I'm upset, usually I'll escape into music and start singing or dancing which helps me feel like I'm showing my emotions indirectly. 

\- I saw a personality test where the instructions were stated as sitting down and closing your eyes for 30 seconds and writing down what thoughts came. I immediately thought about my emotions, how I felt earlier in the day, and then it drifted to the people are close to me, it soon drifted into activities that I'd like to do and I started to notice how quiet the house was. 

\- I'm caring and protective over people but I have a hard time talking about who I am deep down because I tend to worry that my feelings won't make sense. I can close off on people who try to impose the way they think I need to feel, yet I'm good at never judging or placing other people into a box. 

\- I love beauty and activities that allow me to live in the moment. I love to decorate, paint and have beautiful smells and sights around. The environment of a place has a big affect on me. I love to motorbike, drive and do things that allow me to engage in the moment and have fun. 

\- I tend to be a loner but I'm really friendly, and I love being around people. I like saying hi to people and I've enjoyed being a waiter. A lot of times I'm always focusing on other people's lives and feelings and I tend to extremely private about my stuff.  I have an easy time starting conversations with people and I get energized by social interaction, however I dislike parties, and I tend to have a hard time going beyond the acquaintance level. 

\- I can be blunt and I'm good at finding logical solutions. I enjoy analyzing. At school, I was good at reading poetry and then sharing my honest opinion with the class what I liked and what I didn't like. I'm good at saying what needs to be added to improve. I can at times be seen as rude if people don't know that my nitpicking is out of trying to help and not be rude. 

\- I'm good at picking up and understanding patterns. I can see the big picture and intertwined connections which help me understand more philosophical concepts. My thinking isn't random. I also have a bad tendency to drown into my feelings and then connect that to a gloomy, pessimistic view of the future. I can also be mean and revenge seeking when extremely unhealthy.",1587439607
isfp,"Textbook isfp here, done the test 3 times and got isfp on all the tries!! I'm creative, artsy, a big dreamer, a major advice giver to friends, and have quite a bubbly personality if I'm comfortable with the person.

But I feel like my nature leads me to not being taken seriously and not being given serious responsibilities. Furthermore, it has always been my dream to go to med school and I am working for the grades to get there, but I'm afraid some parts of my personality make me a pushover. I am way too independent and rarely ask for help, that has always been who I am, and is my greatest weakness.

 All my leadership/event/commitee positions I've gotten so far, I've had to work so hard for, and although I have proved myself time and time again, seeing my peers so effortlessly lead a group, take command and be respected is hard as someone who by nature is quiet and second guesses everything I do as I want things to be perfect. I also sometimes tend to be seen as the 'lost in her own world' type of person- so that is definetly a part of me I dislike and need to change.

My friend has always been sensitive. He's kind-hearted, and he cares deeply. One of his strongest values is the treatment of himself, and others. He very often has a live and let live mentality.

His stepdad who he's lived with for a while is a Thinker, but I can't guess beyond XSTX based on brief interactions, and what my friend has told me. 

All I know for sure is my friend hates living with him, and his behavior is described as very toxic behind closed doors. A lot of emotional, and verbal abuse. 

At least that's how it was.

My friend snapped, and words got exchanged. His stepdad instead of backing down, or realizing how his behavior was hurting my friend attempted to put his foot down, and my ISFP friend beat him up. 

He's feeling really guilty over it. I mean like depressed levels of guilty. I don't think he intended to be violent, and he described it as being reactionary, and feeling physically sick after realizing what he had done.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - My leader always delay, irresponsible on the project we have planned. Also yell at me when I give him advice to fix this style of work. How to cure him?

&amp;#x200B;

We are working on a game we made (as hobby). I prepare the concepts... and he does the coding for that concept. And after 4 years work with him, I'm SO PISSED OFF &amp; FRUSTRATED with his style of work because nothing has improved. Here's why:

* I prepare the concepts 1-2 weeks in advance before the deadline, and the deadline we discuss &amp; agree together (because we can schedule works for each day -&gt; no rush no stress). But he ALWAYS like ""*I'm busy with my main job*"", ""*I'm tired, let me rest*"" or most ridiculous ""*I'm addictive to another game, let me play so that I'm not stressful*""... therefore **he ALWAYS START TO DO it 1-2 days before**, therefore we have to rush testing/debugging in stress because so close to deadline. OR...
* ... if he thinks he can't finish before the deadline we have set together, he **ALWAYS DELAYS**, like *""Okay. Delay 3 days. I need rest""*. And that is so irresponsible to the community of our game waiting for updates that we have promised
* And the most important part is, whenever I give him advice about the situation (for ex: *""You should organize better""* or *""You can't keep delay from project to project""* etc...), **he ALWAYS yells at me, told me to shut the f\*ck up or ""I'm the boss""** &amp; sh\*ts like that, and **ALWAYS find reasons for his delay**. At this point I think he more like a DICTATOR rather than a LEADER

My question is, are there any advice that I could help him improve in his performance? Because if it keeps continue like this, I think I'm gonna drop out because I can't stand this style of work",1587398287

isfp," 

I apologize for the length in advance, I just attempted to fully release myself so that I could express all the nuances of who I am-feel free to skim if you wish to why I think I could be certain types :)) thank you so much, I truly appreciate it.

Hello, everyone-I‚Äôm not sure how to begin this post, or how to unleash myself, but I feel a desperate need to discover who I am, and a constant uncertainty about my personality, so here I am again. Over the past three years, I felt an endless desire to find myself, and I‚Äôve become so obsessed with MBTI that I find myself constantly cycling in the theory. I still feel like an infinite enigma, however, and constantly changing. It‚Äôs a little unnerving, the mystery of who I am, how I constantly fade and grow and wax and wane, but also beautiful. I just feel this insatiable thirst to unlock the core of who I am, even though it pains. I need to discover the truth of who I am but it also terrifies me. It‚Äôs strangely intoxicating.

I suppose I‚Äôll begin a little by sharing about myself-the strange, surreal, ever evolving person that I am. I‚Äôve always felt so out of touch and lost and aching in this world. My past feels fragmentary and lovely and beautiful, but it feels so ghostlike, nonexistent. So does the future, which also entrances me. I feel like I‚Äôm floating in a lost pocket of time, and I don‚Äôt know who I am. My entire life, I feel, has been that I have been misunderstood, or told to be someone that I am not. My earliest memories stem from wandering around preschool as a child, loving the waters of thought and observing the delights around me, and not wanting to play the games that the other children played. In elementary school, I had moved to a town where I felt out of place because I was surrounded by children of a different ethnicity. I felt so trapped and out of place and terrified. I felt like the entire world despised me. I felt like a sin, a violation. I would hiss at the other children because I felt that they didn‚Äôt like me, intrinsically. I felt so constantly tormented. But I found a love in the own little glittering gems of life that captured me. From crystals and rocks and minerals, which I spent months researching to Nutcracker ballet, and the Romanovs, I found wonderful interests that placed myself in and they guided me. I felt very comfortable speaking with adults, too. Something felt natural and comforting about it, almost liberating. I found, at the end of elementary school, beautiful teachers that I feel were destined to find me, or I to find them, because they shaped me incredibly. They saw the girl beneath the clouds of emptiness and kindled in me an unquenchable love of learning, for stories, they saw my potential and saw that I was so much more than a flaw in a system. I still remember Shel Silverstein poetry and onomatopoeia and all those lovely days, reverberating with delicate piano and hours soaked with reading books I adored.

I feel guilty because I used to lie to my teachers about me ideal life; I dreamed of being the lead ballerina in the Nutcracker, and I told my teachers that I had gotten the role in the Pennsylvania ballet, that my mom was a famous painter and that the hope diamond was buried in our backyard. Sometimes I slipped and said strange things. I was an odd soul and it was so freshly beautiful. That all dissolved in middle school, however; I became so disgustingly and horrendously superficial. I lost myself. I became obsessed with fashion and makeup and gossip, welled in a world of drama. I became a glutted monster that pierced hearts with my tongue, I was empty and disgusting. Over time, I began to mend and grow, and I truly believe that my faith and the gift of words have healed me. They have revived the unique kindness in me, the yearning for love and to love, and even though I still sometimes feel unbearably empty, at least I‚Äôve become a truly good person, I feel it inside. I no longer feel the glaring monsters, I feel an endless sunshine and light seeping inside of me. I have grown and hope to keep growing, for these words to unravel and carry infinite stories, to expand the girl inside, for a growing mind and heart, to transcend these chains of who I am. I feel that my deepest desire is to break the boundaries of who I am. I feel this need to unleash myself and become something lovely, fascinating, complex, unlimited, hoping, growing, changing, healing, and inspiring. I wish to escape from the limits of myself and set the world ablaze with my own unique fire. I just don‚Äôt know how.

So far, I feel most connected to IxFx types. However, I feel that deep down I could be any type, perhaps I am not a type at all. I see different shades and colors of who am, painted in the canvas of my life, and its an explosion of so many girls. I could see Fi in my deeply emotional, sensitive, and yearning self. I could see Fe in the way I immersed myself in the desires of others in middle school, and became a manipulative empty girl, I could see Si in my eternal connection to the past and nostalgia, or Se in the way I was a little reckless as a child, drawing on tables for no reason, and my love of fashion in middle school. I could see Ti in my unquenchable thirst for knowledge and Te in my ruthless barbarism when I feel stressed. I could see Ne in my love for stories and perspectives, for exploring, or Ni in how delightfully entranced I feel by the mysterious, by the future. I feel like a strange ball of all of the types, tangled and knotted and choking. However, I will try to dissect into the three types I could mostly envision myself as (INFP, ISFP, and INFJ) and why I feel that I could be each of them.

Why I could be an INFP: -This is the type I have always forged a deep connection with, in my heart. I‚Äôm a constant endless field of blooming sunflowers of emotions, melting into a horizon dusted with tears and magic. I love words, I love stories, I love growth. I love love. I wish for goodness and laughter and milky ways dancing with mystery and hope and healing, I love melting into poetry and chilling evenings and minds that ignite. I understand my emotions deep down and they sometimes surge like ghosts out of me, haunting me with their striking depth, but they sometimes feel nonexistent. I feel sometimes too INFP to be true, like perhaps I‚Äôm draped in an illusion. I also feel like I use Si; I feel like the past is forever knit into me, that I am always cocooned in it. I still treasure glittering Christmas lights and frosted wishes and days dipped in august light, old but comforting. I have a sometimes jarringly clear memory, and odd fragments of the past like random shirts I saw in a store still in my head because they struck me randomly. I‚Äôm very nostalgic and sentimental. Sometimes, I‚Äôm so buried in the past that it destroys what I have in the present. I have lost friendships because I overwhelmed them with my dwelling in the past, with constantly feeding on old mistakes. The past aches inside of me but it also delights me, dazzles me with its beauty. I despise who I was and love who I was at the same time, a phantom so ugly yet so innocent, so hopeful.

Why I could be an ISFP: -I feel like I neglected my Ne in middle school, if I had it all. I was so buried in the world of fashion and makeup, my camera roll still haunts me. I had an uncanny way of putting outfits together and a natural sense of style, which I feel like INFPs might lack. I was quite reckless with my words and hurt others without thinking, with seeing how painful they wore, how I was stabbing others; when I look at my old writing, I feel like I can see Se. I commented on how I loved looking and seeing the ocean, and how I liked my friends because they like fashion, like me. I was so disgustingly vapid (I‚Äôm sorry, I do not mean to ever offend ISFPs, I am just commenting on my own emptiness) and wanting to be the most ‚Äúbeautiful girl‚Äù. I never cared much or discussed much about philosophical ideas, and most of the stories I borrowed were those from other places, my imagination faded and became a barren wasteland. I also sometimes still cling to sensory pleasures that feel comforting to me (I suppose this could also be Si), like escaping into lovingly warm showers because they feel so cozy and comforting, or eating too much ice cream. I had an aching for adventure and, even though extremely clumsy and despising sports, I could still be quite adventurous. I loved walking among trees when forced to and had a kinship with the ever blossoming world. I also could potentially show signs of tertiary Ni, in that even though I do not have a crystalline plan or vision for the future, I still have some ideals that I wish for, like to find true love or to have a beautiful, bloomin career. I also feel very naturally entranced by the occult and the mystical, I love stories of the unknown and conspiracy theories and ghost stories, anything thrillingly intriguing. I also am quite observant, I sometimes notice details that others cannot and have strange eyes, sometimes they miss certain details while other times I can be keenly observant (I‚Äôm also told that I seem observant too), and I can hear certain sounds in my environment that sometimes other cannot (on the flipside, sometimes I can be painfully oblivious). I have always found nature just so overwhelmingly lovely, from dazzling white acres of snow and laughing tulips and unwinding midnights.

Why I could be an INFJ:

A while ago, I was typed as an INFJ here, and it seemed jarringly possible to me. I feel that, although I know very intimately connected with my feelings, maybe I was originally an Fe user that developed high Fi because I for so long buried myself due to social anxiety. The world of the mysterious, symbolic, and archetypal is my home. I love analyzing people and emotions, what goes beyond the surface, and dissecting into the worlds of others. And, I know this sounds strange, but one night I just oddly woke up and said that I was an INFJ after a dream...which is also bizarrely Ni. I have always tested with Ni as equally high as my Fi, as well as with higher Ti on cognitive function tests. As a child, I loved daydreaming about the future and imagining how old I would be when I married and had children, I was dazzled by the brilliance of the future. I also feel like an old soul deep down, like a ghost constantly floating in a realm where I do not belong, truly belonging to the past. I feel like I could have Fe because I am deeply conflict avoidant and despise chaos, and dim my opinions (unless with those that I am comfortable with, then I can be explosively uncompromising) and I always wished to give others a voice, to see those lost. Even though as a very young child I was naturally inclusive and wanted to make other children feel loved when they were broken, in middle school I became very cliquey and afraid of including others because I felt uncomfortable disturbing the dynamic (Fe, or perhaps inferior Se?). Whenever I see others broken or wallowing in nothingness, I wish I could unleash myself and tell them how uniquely beautiful they are. Also, despite my procrastinating tendencies, I can be oddly ambitious. Sometimes I feel this aching desire for the universe inside of me, to conquer and transcend, to become more; I applied to a university far above my league because it entranced me. I constantly feel incomplete and wish to grow, to change the world, to heal and spread my own unique light, to set ablaze a luminous fire of love and hope and liberation. I also loved to give advice in middle school, on Yahoo answers. It was fun for me, to fix other people‚Äôs problems and place myself in their shoes and offer them solutions and hopes and consolation. I also can wear my heart on my sleeve with those that I deeply (and sometimes too naively) trust. Even with those that hurt me, sometimes I feel this desperate need to vent and I feel disgusting about it, but I open up about my pain and feelings, sometimes even with strangers. I also used to ask others if I upset them or if they were mad at me, constantly worried about whether or not they liked me. I was so drowned in them that I neglected the beauty of who I was. I‚Äôm so glad that I‚Äôve grown and transformed. I also feel a deep and intimate connection with Sylvia Plath, sometimes she feels like an extension of who I am. From the way that she sees the beauty in others to slipping into warm showers to drown in her thoughts to the endless ache for more, the way her words dance on the paper, they seem so familiar to me. Sometimes I wonder if I am just an INFJ 4w5 deeply in touch with her emotions.",1587231266

isfp,"Hello isfp people! 

&amp;#x200B;

I know there isn't a place for my dry,crusty butt here but I wanted share my friendship experience with an ISFP. Share my thoughts and questions about your personality etc.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I've been friends with this ISFP for six years. We met in high school and both in college now. She's very shy, sweet,physically active, emotionally supportive, very funny as she's opened up more with the years, and passionate about her family, kids, and ART!!! 

(Nieces,Nishes, NISHES EVERYWHERE) 

Unlike me, I dislike kids haha the work of taking care of them is overwhelming. I tend to gravitate towards babies or quiet children as I have tried this work as well for a high school volunteer opportunity. Never again but I admire this warm quality she has with kids!! 

Since we're both introverted at heart, we rarely go out. We sometimes have hanged out outside of school but for the most part our meets are usually on campus. The times we've hanged out are pretty sensory stuff that I find draining but satisfying as she helps me get out of my head and on my two feet. Our conversations are initiated by me on good days, but for the most part she initiates with the expectation of me to keep it going. we text most often than call. Different to the infp who talks more. I am not a talker because my thoughts run too fast that can barely keep up with my mouth, so conversations do fall short. However, she and I laugh it off and stay in this comfortable silence, at least for me. She tends to get anxious when we both get quiet but I tell her that it's alright to enjoy the silence for awhile. The times where she needed help with situational choices and homework, I am usually her trusted contact. For me, I find her for emotional help. She is very open and non judgmental towards people so I know I can be completely myself with dumping my emotional distress on her and she helps me get out of the Ti Ni loop. The times she's been vulnerable with me, I try my best to comfort her and mostly give advice. I KNOW I KNOW, no one asked for it but I can't help it:)  Since conversation does fall short, I find it difficult to enjoy it completely because I have noticed that she holds back ALOT more than I do. The few times she's open up, it's rare but worth it. I am not a stereotypical intj, I'm pretty outgoing and warm towards others with the exception of the dark, dry humor. It's every time I try to go beyond the surface of a topic, she gets nervous and uncomfortable so I have to dial it down. It is waaaaay different with an intp or infp who keeps me on my toes with their ideas. And I have tried to tell her about this, but she usually doesn''t want to talk about it. It can be frustrating and annoying sometimes because I want our friendship to grow and be open with one another but she doesn't seem comfortable with me and doesn't seem to make the effort that I make with our conversations. 

So, I want to know how can I help my friend be more comfortable? What can I do to help her?

 I really want to continue our friendship because with her I don't have to force myself to go out, force a social mask that I have to put up with exxp, and I want to get to know her more in depth. I admire her authenticity to herself and passion for her family and THE KIDS. I've thought that it's my bluntness and humor that keeps her away for fear of criticism but I try my best to not say things I know she will take them to heart.

isfp,"Groups of friends when you are young are easy: you are here to have fun. Growing through teenage years make people both very opiniated (going against what has been taught to find their own ways and prove themselves) and much more fearful because they now know they have to face life on their own (no more security). So you create deeper bonds with people, but it also enhances easy co-dependencies (the need to find emotional support) / serious rivalries (the need to find yourself).

I have met a group of friends with pretty different people (although nearly only F types haha) and at first it was extraordinary for the several points of views and knowledge different people could bring to the table. We all got very close. The issue is, being young adults, a lot of pride and insecurity got involved, and then the cluster became this half-safe and enjoyable domain (with people you love) and half-squeezland of identities: some people idealizing one person and putting them above others, some dismissing themselves because of feeling incompetent next to the person seemingly ""shinier"", several being completely uncompromising about discussing values and how we should all share the same ones, some forcing the idea that when a huge part of the group meets, everyone should also meet, others being completely uncompromising and never actually caring about finding solutions with/for the group...

Obviously those issues were already around when I got in, they just got worse and clearer over time, until we realized no matter how much we loved the fun and interesting dynamic of the group reuniting, it was just not sustainable anymore.

So my issue is that I love hearing from different people on a specific subject, but close people growing together end up acting like a couple that should be completely balanced on values: which is not possible. Not everyone's opinions and inner self is valued in the same way by the same people and so it leads to the eating of singularities and of identities because of growing a lack of self-confidence in comparison to others. 

I don't know if I am being very clear, but I think communities of different people cannot sustain being too close because equality of treatment and respect of individualities is hardly feasible: as people are humans and humans put others on scales on which they unconciously or not decide who they prefer over the other and as some people are simply more selfish than others. It just promotes the complete opposite of my deepest value: the freedom to be and grow your own self.

isfp,"hi i'm a 20F xSTJ dating a 20M ISFP, and i wanted to share tips about how i became best friends with, and later started dating him. feel free to shoot me down in the comments if you disagree with anything!

1. really be yourself. don't try to put up a cool front or only show your good side to impress an ISFP etc. it's more comfortable for to be yourself around an imperfect person. (if it's an INFP they may be shattered because their perfect image of you in their mind might get shattered lol)

2. the more introverted and quieter they are, the more important this tip is. always encourage them when they says their thoughts! engage with what they said instead of using it as a stepping stool to tell more of your own stories, or worse just flat out disagree and disregard. ask questions, agree and laugh, anything positive. when it's clear he's done, you can resume talking lol. 

if you disagree, stay quiet and move on (like an ISFP would do), and later if you feel like you really need to tell them, then don't text! call or meet them, then say it as nicely and understandingly as you can. 

3. make an effort to pick the conversation back up when it dies down! it should go both ways, but still. do at least your share, or else it won't work. it should be easy if you don't know each other well and are learning about each other though (talk about each other's past, present, and maybe future)

4. don't be afraid to ask him to hang out! with ISFPs you have to be more initiative. it's better if instead of just ""lets hang out"" to have more direction, like ""hey i'm craving (food), wanna go eat?"" or ""hey wanna study together""

also if you're dating an ISFP... you have to take initiative lol. i'm pretty sure if i didn't initiate it with my ISFP bf, we would still be nothing more than BFFs lmao. i'm the one who initiated the first physical contact, we equally initiated the first kiss, and i initiated first uh bed intimacy.

5. one step up is to make him feel like a closer friend. when you go to the store, ask him if he wants to come, or if he needs anything (we lived in neighboring dorms), or tell him a secret!

me personally: my favorite (metal) artist released a new album and i shared it to him. i actually go to church though and don't look like a metalhead at all lol, so i said ""don't tell anyone cause it's embarrassing! it's a secret that i listen to metal, ok?"" and he laughed ""ok""",1586558789

I switched to a 4th grader, with severe something where he did NOT want to do his work and would actually argue with me, call me rude when I told him to do his work, would behave like this in the special ed room, but like a good kid in his general ed room. I ended up getting so frustrated/stressed/anxious that I began to cry and had to leave home for the day. The only way for me to get him to read a book was to threaten taking him to the principal‚Äôs office. I‚Äôm 24 and I‚Äôm typed as ISFP-A. Usually I‚Äôm very laidback and patient, but this kid triggered something in me.. don‚Äôt know what.

Wendy is a grade school teacher and Hubert is an accountant for a small retail company.  Wendy's school has shut down due to the pandemic and is receiving a stipend from her school district while Hubert now works from home and has taken a temporary reduced salary.  In order to continue paying their bills and mortgage payments Hubert tells Wendy that he's going to start making withdrawals from his short-term brokerage account.

&amp;#x200B;

Wendy has no idea what investment account Hubert is talking about and is notably distressed that she didn't know about this other account that has a very decent level of cash sitting in it, and that he should have told her about it.  Hubert has had this investment account since before they were married and claims that he told her about it when they opened their joint account.  He primarily uses the account to trade stocks, and occasionally makes contributions to the account from his paycheck, and with it has grown a substantially sizeable investment.  He says he has never withdrawn any of the funds in the account until recently to cover the mortgage.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, Wendy is smart, but she doesn't have any experience in finance and has never had any interest in the stock market so she has never logged into the account, and has possibly forgotten that Hubert ever even told her about it.  He says the reason he never brought up the account after the first time is because it was just his hobby and didn't think she cared because she never asked him.  She presses that they could have been spending the money on some other private matters that I won't say here, but will say that they are reasonable expenses and not entirely unnecessary, but also not critically necessary.

&amp;#x200B;

Hubert says the investment account isn't for making and hoarding money, it's simply his hobby, and he's good at his hobby.  He says where Wendy buys painting supplies for her hobby in painting, he puts his spending money in the stock market.  To say that the investment fund should be used for their joint ventures would be akin to saying that Wendy should spend less on paints and brushes and put more into the joint account, or even to sell her paintings and put the proceeds into the joint account.  I'm not sure if he actually told her this, and I certainly hope he didn't!

&amp;#x200B;

Hubert's asked her what he can do to make things right, and she's gone as far as suggesting folding the brokerage account into their joint account, which I think she honestly feels herself is unreasonable.  I know she's not upset because of the money since Hubert is in fact using it to pay for their joint fiscal responsibilities.

&amp;#x200B;

If it sounds like I'm siding with Hubert, it's because I really only have Hubert's side of the story, I'm a little scared of talking to Wendy because I've never seen her like this before, and while it's none of my business, they are two friends that I love both dearly and think that this is just a result of misunderstanding that could be worked out through communication.  Is this a futile effort?  What can be done?",1586319350
isfp,"Hello,

The other day I was browsing the ISTJ sub. They fascinate me for many reasons, especially I think because they're extremely serious and conservative - which I'm absolutely not (plus the fact that a few years ago I had a huge crush on a ISTJ girl and I still wonder sometimes how it was possible). So I had this idea to ask them, on their sub, what do they think about ISFP. Here's the thread :

For perspective I am an ENFP, and I didn't even notice this student. But over time I started getting impressed by her calm and reserved personality and yet when she opened up, she looked very sensible and mature and that started intriguing me. But now, I am falling for her very very badly and there have been mixed signs from her. 

We started talking a bit on social media and I do most of the talking while she almost never initiates a conversation or asks me anything. Now the problem is I am not sure how interested she is in me. And if she will ever muster up the courage to start a conversation or to pursue this? I know ISFPs are very ethical and she might not even consider this a possibility but my gut feeling says she has considered this a possibility at some point.

isfp,"Hello ISFPs 

I read that if you're looking to understand what the ISFP is thinking or feeling, you gotta look at their actions and not their words because they usually not great at expressing themselves. I was just wondering how true this holds for the whole lot of you. I do appreciate that every ISFP is different and that external factors (upbringing, experiences etc.) influence this, but I'd like to listen to different perspectives. 

General thoughts are good enough. You don't need to weigh in on my story if you don't want to. 

I've recently been spending lots of time together with my ISFP friend in a group setting. We don't talk much outside of groups but we have shared a few personal stories between the both of us. He mentioned once before that we are like brothers and sisters but recently, his actions tell me otherwise. He can be very bold on some days and compliments me on the way I look or dress, but this is always mentioned alongside a joke. He also always makes sure that my needs are constantly met wherever we are e.g. making sure I have water, and that I know what I want to eat before we all order etc., but I guess this can also a sign of a platonic friendship. He has also been pretty touchy towards me but this usually happens we're drinking. However, with all of this happening, he is also bent on associating me with other guys. His words and actions really don't seem to match up at all. 

This is driving my INFP-self crazy from the overthinking. I can't say for sure that I have 100% romantic feelings for him but this change in dynamics is definitely making me uncomfortable and unsure about my own feelings. I know you guys value honesty and maybe I Just need to ask him what his intentions are but I also need to have some idea what I might be getting myself into. I don't want to ruin this friendship (cliched, I know). Does anyone have any idea what's going on with him?

isfp,"I'm a Gryffindor. One thing that really speaks to me about Gryffindor is the sense of right and wrong, or my values, and morality. I'm 18 now, and in the last few years as I've grown to know myself better I realized that I feel **extremely** passionate about things. My own sense of right and wrong, and I wouldn't change that for the world.

This is the same kind of morality in Tolkien's works, which is one of the main reasons why I can relate to much to Lotr. I love the quote *There are other forces at work in this world, besides the one that is evil*.

And possibly the best quote I've ever heard:

*Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back only they didn‚Äôt.*  
*Because they were holding on to something.*

*Frodo : What are we holding on to, Sam?*

*Sam : That there‚Äôs some good in this world, Mr. Frodo. And it‚Äôs worth fighting for.*

I can't even begin to describe how much I understand and feel this.

But honestly, I don't really see how exactly my MBTI type relates to Gryffindor, because I don't even understand my type that well yet (I literally realized I was an ISFP yesterday). Maybe traits like passionate, idealistic, stubborn etc. aren't even ISFP. Not sure.",1586261125

isfp,"I'm sort of inventorying my life, like a lot of people.  Some of my best friends are ISFP women that I do activities with, like ballet, and dance classes. (I'm a cis, heteronormative INFJ).  I've been really close to one male ISFP and briefly dated another.

The thing that did not seem to work out with male ISFPs, on anything other that a friendship level, was communication.  We're talking years of, ""If you'd talked to me five years or ten years ago,"" type communications which actually led to a lot of hurt feelings.

And then the one I actually dated briefly, of course, came back two years later.

I almost think the communication thing is because of experiencing time differently?  I'm an INFJ-T, which means I really dwell on the past.

By the time an ISFP that I don't know in a structured setting decides they're, ""ready to date me,"" I'm so mad at them, and or, over it, years later that there's basically no hope of repair--and in one case I couldn't even remember the guys' name, despite the fact that we were friends for seven years previously.

isfp,"I thought I would compare astrology/zodiac and MBTI, because I‚Äôm bored and it seemed kind of fun.

I‚Äôve seen other people try to resolve this, but I don‚Äôt know if anyone‚Äôs ever done a breakdown quite like mine. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they had. I thought the big problem was going to be finding a way to put 16 types into twelve boxes, but it turned out that was super easy, barely an inconvenience. The structure of the zodiac gave me an easy way to do that. 

So first I thought of the cognitive functions, and what they would be represented by in the classic zodiac elements: Fire, Earth, Air and Water. Fire I think corresponds to Intuition, Earth to Sensing, Air to Thinking, and Water to Feeling. That‚Äôs all relatively straightforward. I think an argument could be made that Fire is Feeling and Water is Intuition, but this is what I went with. 

The other way that zodiac signs are distinguished is ‚Äòquality‚Äô: Cardinal, Fixed, and Mutable. It seems that Cardinal quality is pretty clearly Extraverted, and Fixed quality is pretty clearly Introverted, while Mutable is both. So I decided that the Cardinal signs would lead with an Extraverted function, the Fixed signs would lead with an Introverted function, and the Mutable signs would lead with both, and therefore the Mutable zodiac signs would be where we double up MBTI types. 

But how to decide which type that leads with Extraverted Intuition would be Aries, and which would be one of the two Sagittarius types? The two MBTI types that lead with Extraverted Intuition are ENTP and ENFP.  I figured that the Mutable signs are inherently more complex, and therefore if the auxiliary function is a Feeling or Intuition function, those would be classified as Mutable, and if the auxiliary function is Sensing or Thinking, that would be classified as Cardinal or Fixed. So, with that as my basis, I have come up with the following list of zodiac-MBTI corollaries. 

Cardinal Fire / **Aries** / Extraverted Intuition / **ENTP**

Fixed Earth / **Taurus** / Introverted Sensing / **ISTJ**

Mutable Air / **Gemini** / Both Thinking [2 Types] / **ENTJ** and **INTP**

Cardinal Water / **Cancer** / Extraverted Feeling / **ESFJ**

Fixed Fire / **Leo** / Introverted Intution / **INTJ**

Mutable Earth / **Virgo** / Both Sensing [2 Types] / **ESFP** and **ISFJ**

Cardinal Air / **Libra** / Extraverted Thinking / **ESTJ**

Fixed Water / **Scorpio** / Introverted Feeling / **ISFP**

Mutable Fire / **Sagittarius** / Both Intuition [2 Types] / **ENFP** and **INFJ**

Cardinal Earth / **Capricorn** / Extraverted Sensing / **ESTP**

Fixed Air / **Aquarius** / Introverted Thinking / **ISTP**

Mutable Water / **Pisces** / Both Feeling [2 Types] / **ENFJ** and **INFP**

isfp,"I have been in to this girl for a few months now and initially I felt she was ignoring me so I didn't think this could work. But I kept dropping hints and recently she tried to contact me on her own. The problem is our conversations are very very short. We mainly text - in our conservative culture, calling or meeting up is considered a HUGE thing. Its rare that she would start a conversation and when I would do, she would resort to very small answers. So for example if I say 50-70 words, she will only answer with 10-18.

I came to know she was an ISFP so I have been very careful and tried not to talk too much. I have also tried to control my energy so that I don't smother her with it. But I absolutely genuinely adore her. I am so madly attracted to the calmness in her and her ability to use clear concise words and the ability to stay grounded. And as much as I want to talk to her I can't seem to find much of an opening. 

One of the challenges is that we are workplace colleagues and our roles are such that she has to work under me and I wonder if it is stopping her from expressing herself completely. She did say that she takes time getting to know someone and I really want her to start the conversation some day rather than me starting it. 

Any help would be much appreciated in this case. I would also like to know how long should I wait before contacting her? A day, a week? How slow should we take it in the start?

I miss her so very much - I guess I am very badly smitten by her charm. It becomes an intense battle with myself to not contact her or talk to her, so far I am doing okay, but any guidance from you guys would probably calm the nerves further.",1586053954

isfp,"\- When I first met her, I liked her a lot because she was a warm person. She was friendly and talks in an enthusiastic way like wishing people good luck, telling them not to worry, using a lot of exclamations marks and emojis when texting.

\- She dyes her hair a lot of different colors like purple and silver. She doesn't doll up much but still wears makeup on a regular basis and gets her nails done. 

\- She likes skateboarding and dancing, but doesn't go out much. She doesn't like having many friends or hanging out. She also doesn't participate in classes even when it affects her grades and isn't that comfortable with strangers. She always picks to sit facing away from people.

\- Although she's uncomfortable with strangers, she loves receiving male attention from guys she knows better. She brags about how nicely her guy friends treat her all the time. She brags about other things like grades too, but she mostly talks about guys and herself. She posts stories on social media bragging about all the things guys do for her, when guys compliment her, when she gets random DMs, etc.

\- She isn't confrontational and dislikes engaging in drama. I believe drama is her biggest pet peeves because she also stereotypes a lot of girls to be full of drama, so she barely has any girl friends. 

\- She used to enjoy gossiping, but her friend called her out on gossiping, which led to an ended friendship. After this, she stopped gossiping about people.

\- She takes advantage of people without being aware of it. She's constantly asking everyone for the tiniest favors even when she doesn't know the person well. I have a mutual friend who holds a grudge against her because the only time she contacts the mutual is for favors.

\- She does work very first minute and rushes everything like getting home or buying school supplies. She rushes through assignments quickly so that she can just get them over with. She doesn't care for perfection and often would just copy others' work without checking it, but she still wants good grades. Her best subject in school is English and she has gotten praised by teachers for her writing skills.

\- She's a negative person who always feel stressed and anxious. When she feels this way, she needs to vent to someone otherwise her mood will only continue getting worse. She has vented to an uber driver, cried to a mutual on the phone, and people have told her that she needs to change her mindset. She gets stressed by school and relationship problems. I believe she's pretty open because she told details about her personal life problems to a temporary coworker.

\- She can't make decisions on her own and needs the opinion and advice of others before making up her mind. She would spend hours brainstorming her choices with a typed up documents that's organized before settling on a final decision. When she's deciding, she goes back and forth many times and gets anxiety about making the wrong choice.

\- She adjusts her behavior depending on who she's with. She acts more friendly and filtered with me, but more sassy and ghetto with some other guy friends. 

\- She isn't very self aware when it comes to her flaws. She doesn't think anything she did wrong in her ended friendships and puts the blame entirely on the other person. She also said she's a great friend and too caring of a person even though some people think she's selfish and self absorbed. For example, whenever we text the conversation is centered around herself and the second I switch the topic to myself, she would ignore the text. 

\- She complained about her ex being too clingy and jealous, but didn't have much of a problem constantly facetiming him during class, so I don't think she needs much alone time or privacy. In their relationship, I think they were both the cause of the breakup because he was overly jealous and possessive, but she also didn't make things any better because she did things like go to prom with another guy and always hangs out with guys.",1586030022

isfp,"Hey there,

 ENFJ here! 

I had a fight with the ISFP I was seeing and it started because I expressed that I was anxious about the future and he just casually told me everything would be fine because things were fine before. I got upset because things were not fine before. I made them fine after much struggle and hard-won victories (struggled with panic attacks and depression) and told them so. They replied to me that they think I think too negatively and should just be positive about things.

This basically set me off as afterwards whenever I made some small comment like ‚Äúwoah that person is so amazing, I can‚Äôt believe they can do that‚Äù, they‚Äôll say things like ‚Äúahaa with that attitude you can‚Äôt‚Äù or they‚Äôll write things like ‚Äúhope you‚Äôre thinking positively today‚Äù ‚Äî and it irritated me so much because I found it incredibly condescending. I never said I was negative and I‚Äôve always taken care of myself just fine.

I told them to not say I think negatively because that is untrue. I simply look at things realistically. I accept that as a person I have hopes and I have fears and I should be able to express them equally. And basically they didn‚Äôt understand and told me to just accept we are different and move on. But, I couldn‚Äôt because how could we be together if I didn‚Äôt even feel comfortable sharing things about myself without being judgment? I said that I couldn‚Äôt let it go in which they said that ‚Äúwell then there‚Äôs nothing I can say‚Äù and I gave up and said that I‚Äôm leaving if there‚Äôs nothing to talk about.

Afterwards, he actively avoided seeing me for about a week. I eventually got ahold of him and told him I‚Äôm sorry that our argument got out of hand. To which he said ‚Äúwell, I‚Äôm still mad but I accept your apology‚Äù.

And again I felt that uppidy condescending attitude and wondered why I had to chase him down for a week and had to be the only one to apologize when I was originally just trying to get him to stop judging me. 

At this point, I was tired. So I asked to break up. And he kinda just (imo a bit immaturely) said ‚Äúwell actually I wanted to break up with YOU‚Äù and said a list of bad things about me.

Then, 4 days later he tries to talk to me and tells me he was just saying things out of anger bc I asked to break up. He was also upset that I wasn‚Äôt happy to just connect and build our relationship around our shared hobbies (like games), even though he doesn‚Äôt even realize I don‚Äôt care about the gameplay itself, I love thinking and analyzing the themes it‚Äôs trying to express.   He also emphasized how in reality he deeply loved and cared for me so much that he avoided me so he could contain them and... I‚Äôm not sure if I buy that. It doesn‚Äôt make sense to me that if he cared about me so much, he would cut me off and ignore my feelings. 

I‚Äôm not getting back with him for sure since it feels like he denied my entire existence and I‚Äôm still in pain ,  but am just curious if all this is typical ISFP behaviour or reds flags with this person specifically.

I haven‚Äôt been like that since high school. Maybe early college. I‚Äôm much older now and this isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúrelationship gone stale‚Äù situation because I‚Äôve had lots of relationships after the exciting ones I mentioned.

Now that I'm looking at typology, I wonder if this is this is our sort of superpower. Of course, just knowing who you are doesn't guarantee success in life, but I would bet that every ISFP would define success differently anyway. I do feel grateful that I didn't have to struggle to figure out who I am, and I wonder if that is common for our type.",1585815644

Recently my ISFP friend and crush started avoiding me. I have no idea as to why she would do that afterall there wasn't really a reason. Ofc I texted her asking her why she avoided me. No answer. One evening my friend (ENFP) and I were talking in our gc. (Our gc included ENFP, ISFP and me) and we see that she read our messages and was active. Suddenly she changes her profile into a disturbing image n stuff. She then texts ENFP and of course I demanded an explanation because:
1. I had a panic attack because of that
2. I was worried something had happened 

Then suddenly she texts me and tells me that I'm the toxic one and that she feels suffocated and wants to leave me forever. You might think ""huh you must have fucked up!""
Well let me elaborate:
1. I was listening to her feelings all the time and tried to give her everything!
2. She constantly went on hiatus and never really was there for me. 
3. We argued quite a lot because she didn't put any effort into the relationship and expected me to do so but she never changed anything 
4. I tried to leave her twice but she guilt tripped me into staying 
5. She made me think she needed me when I was just a toy
6. I felt pressured to change myself 
7. At one point I felt drained talking to her

The days go by. I go on a walk to think about things and apologize later. She blocked me and ENFP saying she needed to go on a hiatus. (She didn't leave ENFP). Thing is we're on another app where we usually rp and she's pretty active there. Blocked me on 2 out of 3 platforms. I felt nauseous, got panic attacks and nightmares when I thought about her (which was a lot because she makes me think I'm wrong). Now it's better but I need advice and maybe some explanation?

Personally I believe that life doesn't have a built-in meaning, but you have to make one yourself. Like, I'd compare life to a sheet of paper, initially it is empty, but you can grab some pens and pencils and fill it in however you want. I that's actually pretty neat if you think about it, since if life did have some sort of universal purpose it would be rather impersonal and everyone would have the exact same path to follow. Then, things like religion and spirituality, I identify as an atheist since I don't see much reason to believe the contrary, but at the same time there's a part of me that's like ""but there *could* be, it's not like science and human intelligence know *everything*"". If anything, you could say I believe in a god of randomness and infinity. Like, there are probably so many things going on that even people like Einstein and Hawking could never have known, like death might not even be eternal, but at the same time something like heaven and hell might not exist either.

isfp,"So basically I am pretty sure I am an introverted feeler because I have always been sensitive since I was a little kid. 

People have always told me that I have been known to be really calm since I was a baby as my mom said I gave them the least amount of stress as I was mostly peacefull. 

My demeaner I believe is described as being ""Care free"", by how I walk and basically am, allot of people tell me how I just look like I do not care about anything. 

Ever since I was young I have always enjoyed ""moulding"" myself into the moment, and just be. 

My other cognitive functions like introverted and extroverted intuition are very developed as well. But I only use them whenever I want to ""know"" something otherwise I just like to relax and drink some water.

I have been very lazy my whole life, I can get allong with anyone or any group of people of various cultures, etc.

Any person can get allong with me, I have hung out with bums, crackheads, entrepenuers, muslims, gang bangers, christians, convicts, etc. I always treated them as another person.

I used to be argumentative when I was younger back when I was dominant in Ne/Ti, but even though most of my functions are developed I only use them if I need to.

Back in middle school and highschool I was a heavy Ti as well but after I learned everything I wanted to know I switch from that to Si which I think transferred the crystalized intelligence to what is Ni which I only use when I speak about things to people that is about a certain topic that has deep meaning.

But now I feel like my intelligence is purely Fi and I speak what I feel without processing it through Ni or Ti.

So could an ISFP be an actualized Ne/ti user?

If so would that mean that the ISFP type is considered the most calm and relaxed for a reason because they already ""figured"" it all out and no longer rely on other functions as much as others?",1585350888

Years ago, I knew a bunch of people in an online chat room, for several years.  One of the people in that room started creating a separate online room and bullying me behind my back, with a set group of people who were, I thought, also my friends. This went on for at least four months. (I'd create a new display name and watch them trash me behind my back.)

The ISFP in question reappeared twice over the next several years, once to ask me out, and then a second time to ask me if I wanted to join a chat room run by my primary bully.

It was bad enough that I never trusted that group of people again; it cost me a job, the ability to network there, and pretty much convinced me to avoid their industry.  I had PTSD about the bullying for several months when I encountered them all again, decades later. 

The ISFP in question seemed to think that it was inappropriate that I was unkind to him when he asked me to rejoin a group run by someone who bullied me, terribly.  It was like he thought I should have gotten over it, instead of having nightmares about all of them. 

I don't understand why they're still friends. Is this an ISFP thing to forgive really bad behavior as if it never happened?",1585251404

* I do everything first minute and rush through the task so I can get it over with to enjoy free time. I take shortcuts and care more about efficiency than perfect results. I'd rather spend little time just to get a B than a lot of effort to get an A. I usually do trade-offs with friends for homework so we only need to finish half the assignment then copy the other half.
* I have an extremely terrible temper and have been to anger management classes. Often I get mad at the smallest things. I've gotten into many arguments, always confront people when I have an issue with them, and have ended friendships with multiple people throughout the years.
* I hate rules and often don't listen to them. I've disobeyed teachers, talked back to authority, cheated on exams, stolen from a store, always use my phone in class, have gotten a truancy letter, and continued ditching class after a security caught me and reported me to a counselor.
* My dream career is to be a professor because of the autonomy, freedom, and time flexibility. I want to be able to control all the decisions, make the rules, and work at any time I want.
* I come across as intimidating, serious, and quiet when first meeting. I talk less to people I'm less comfortable with and talk more to people who are more extroverted and easygoing even if I hardly know them.
* I'm impatient and hate waiting for things. I used to have a hard time waiting even 2 minutes for a bus, but I'm better at waiting now. I'm often rushing because time is of an essence.
* I usually think I'm right about everything even without sufficient evidence.
* I'm often arrogant and overestimate my abilities. I always think I score 100% on every test I take.
* I'm usually just listening to music at home or watching Netflix, but if I had a group of friends I actually like, I would rather be busy outside doing things like karaoke, trying new restaurants, riding roller coasters, playing arcade games, going to concerts, and etc. I also like competitive video games.
* I don't express my emotions besides anger, so I come across more cold than I actually am.
* Some people have called me blunt, which could be another reason some people are intimidated by me. I speak in a direct way, have strong eye contact, and a resting bitch face. I don't smile much. Some people also say I walk aggressively.
* I don't do anything to actively seek it out, but I enjoy attention. I like receiving compliments and people looking at me when I enter a classroom.
* I find planning fun and have planned my entire course roadmap for my college classes when I'm only halfway through college.
* I love thinking about the future and barely ever think of the past. Part of the reason I always think into the future is because I want complete control over how my future will turn out.
* I'm responsible and have my shit together. I have all A's and am working a job related to my major (accounting).
* I'm usually the group leader of projects because everyone else is too lazy or dumb to take charge. It's not that I want to be the leader; I simply just don't trust their leadership abilities. I'd prefer to get by doing nothing at all because I'm lazy.
* My biggest pet peeves are who are disrespecting and having an attitude with me, people telling me what to do or giving me unsolicited advice, and wasting time.
* People might find me boring because I don't have much of a sense of humor and mostly just stay at home.
* People often tell me I'm confident like when I do presentations or interviews.
* My social skills aren't the best because sometimes I have nothing to say.
* I have a bad attention span. I'm often spacing out in class and sometimes don't pay attention to what people are saying to me.

The last time I had taken it was over a year ago and had got ESPF. Over the last summer I had done a lot of self development and traveling. This time my results placed me as ISFP which I cannot agree with more. I had always seen introverted personalities as negative until I‚Äôve finally accepted who I was. ~ mind you I‚Äôve always enjoyed my alone time in my room, hated large events/gatherings, and love to solo travel.

Continuing, just wondering if anyone has experience with being in an romantic relationship with an INTP?
- classic INTP to not trust Myers Briggs meanwhile I‚Äôve been obsessed.
I find that we are on complete opposite scales however meet in the middle with such an amazing understanding. I find he can be very analytical and factual based meanwhile I‚Äôm always going off my feelings and positive energy. In a way we both ground each other because he reminds me to think rationally while I remind him how beautiful it is outside. 

If anyone else has insight I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts.",1585018268

- Although she enjoys staying indoors, she also loves a good laugh and teasing her friends by trolling them
- She isn‚Äôt very good with expressing how she feels in words, and she‚Äôs quite shy upon first meeting. 
- Cries super easily from things like movies and seeing other people cry, but tries not to cry because once she does, it takes her a long time to stop. 
- She hates facetiming on her own and doesn‚Äôt like recording herself talking about things unless she‚Äôs with other people.
- Gets nervous pretty easily 
- She‚Äôs a pretty big spender who‚Äôs indecisive when it comes to purchases, so she usually buys both instead of choosing between two items. However some may find her a bit cheap because she often says she doesn‚Äôt have money to purchase certain things when she does.
- She dresses casually; t shirts, jeans, sneakers. Nothing too flashy or dolled up. 
- In school, her best subject was science and her worst was math. She was also bad at sports

isfp,"Hello! :)

Lately I have asked myself, if there are connections/relationships between the Myer-Briggs-Types we like the most and our own type. So I wanted to make a survey to find out the ""favorite"" types of each Myer-Briggs-Type.

If you have, can you please tell **up to three** personality types (**excluding your own**) you like interacting with most and with which you prefer to spend your time with. Just the one you like the most.

**For example**:  
I am Enfp and I like XXXX, XXXX and XXXX the most 

\----&gt; you don¬¥t need to explain *why* you like them the most

Since the mbti community has 88k Members and the Enfp community alone has 42k members, I decided that I would post this post on each subreddit of each type because I want as much answers as possible. So sorry in advance if you might see this post more than once

And yes, I know that even within one personality type, the people differ, we are all individuals. But from my experience with people with different personality types I can say that, in general I liked a specific personality type more than an other.

I will be happy about receiving every comment anwering my question!! :))",1584995983

I do love taking care of those I love but I do not go out of my way to help people, I'm just the ""nice quiet girl"". I've also gotten ISFP and INFP among other ones. Depending on my mood and mindset, it seems the results differ. Here are a few facts about me:

‚Ä¢ I am very quiet around people I don't know mainly because I don't have much to say and fear judgement from others. 
‚Ä¢I hate small talk
‚Ä¢Even though I hate small talk I'm a slut for reality tv/ drama lol
‚Ä¢I get bored of things very easily 
‚Ä¢ I like doing artistic things and am fairly good at it but I HAVE to be in the right mood. I'm so inconsistent lol
‚Ä¢One thing that I never tire of is nature/being outside(hense my username) I remember spending sooo much time outside as a kid. It's my happy place.
‚Ä¢I don't like reading. I'd rather watch a movie or being doing stuff with my hands.

isfp," 

* I have a strong interest in aesthetics. I was the type of person who obsessively searched for pictures that matched to post on instagram just to have an aesthetic. I stopped this habit but I still do it with clothes. when they don't match I am definitely bothered by it.
* I am very lazy but when I want something or I need some specific information I tend to rush absurdly and be extremely impatient. lets imagine that i'm an adventurer that need a specific tree in a forest full of trees, the only way to get it that passes to my mind is to go clearing everything until i find it. or if I were a train that just focused on getting to the next station and would pass over anything that was ahead. because of this mind process I tend to skip several steps when I do certain tasks.
* sometimes I have some obsessive thoughts about a very specific things. i really dont know why. like I can't stop researching things about mbti even though I'm not very interested in that subject anymore. I noticed that many times these thoughts are doubts or subjects that I have not yet found a conclusion or answer or some kind of worry about a random thing.
* I tend to talk to myself a lot and honestly I don‚Äôt know how to do that with other people. I don't have much to say, I suck at making conversation with other people, I have tremendous anxiety because of that and I always have to avoid it if possible.
* messy af. i don't see much need to tide up things.
* if i were some mythological creature i would probably be a demon. seriously this idea of appearing every century just to tantalize others and see humans fighting each other seems to be an extremely interesting way of killing boredom.
* people say that I am a very neutral person even in terms of facial expressions. when i was looking at google photos i noticed that in all my photos i had the same facial expression as in this case: '-' it looks like i would be a great bella swan even though i'm a guy
* too much sensory information leaves me bewildered and even drains me, because of that I am terrible at activities that need quick or even direct responses and I am also terrible at anything I need to use my body, my strength and my energy . I think that this characteristic has a huge weight in my life because it defined who I am in many important things in my life. seriously, if i could i would stay in my room forever just reflecting with myself.
* I always guide myself through an sequential thought process. I'm always making connection between the information I have, I can deduce how similar things can end up behaving and that way I will guide myself around the world. many people do not find me very reliable because of this because my way of thinking is not very orthodox.
* for not knowing how to socialize with other people, I adopted the role of ""group clown"". nowadays I have been acting this way less often because I am sick of dealing with other people.
* I am very narcissistic and megalomaniacal but not in a chronic way but I tend to think I am superior to other people even though I am very regular. in the past it was much worse I always wondered why people are not interested in me because I think I‚Äôm awesome and blah blah blah
* sometimes when I compose some sad music I tend to have watery eyes and I even feel ""sad"" and I just don't know why that happens, because I just play other sad songs that I've heard on the surface
* I don't like contact and I feel uncomfortable when people go beyond my space",1584988102

You can now pick an unexplored path and walk until you get to discover new items to bring with you on your adventure, like a Clever Wing that will allow you to protect yourself sagaciously, or a tiny Grepa Berry that might lower your walls a little but that will increase your chances of friendships, as your next step is to befriend other pok√©mons and come across other trainers! At this point and for at least 300 years, do not succomb to the easy want of a psychic type like Victi'ni in your team because they might influence you without your consent by using Amnesia, Confusion or Imprison and will try to trap you inside the Mirage Caves, leaving you completely lost by yourself and with little hope of seeing light at the end of tunnel anytime soon. Although do not hesitate to catch a flying type, as attacks such as Fly and Acrobatics will allow you to get more freedom of directions and increase your adaptability and likelihood of different types of discoveries. Now that you have a team and that you are on the road, you are in charge and you need to care for the well-being of each of you. By roaming different cities, interesting places and meeting new trainers, you will build stronger defenses and will collect fresh berries to avoid getting any of your members hurt, like a Cherri berry that cures paralysis or a Chesto berry that cures sleep. If you keep walking by avoiding suffering and illusions, then your chances of winning several times against the Te-am Rocket will greatly increase. The only right thing to do is to keep moving, as long as you know when having a good S nooz,e so as to get back on track s?trong**e**r than before.

He didn‚Äôt necessarily get the sense of humor, but I could feel he was enjoying sharing energy with me. I began to be silly every day in music class with him.

Freshman year, him and I had French class together. His French name was ‚Äò Raphael ‚Äò and I still call him that to this day. I got every one in school, including our teachers to call him Raphael as opposed to his actual name. Him and I sat next to each other and had so much fun in French. We just joked and didn‚Äôt do our work at all. We sat at the same lunch table. We went out to eat together every Friday during freshman year. Sophomore year, him and I were going to different schools but we still stayed in touch. We Skyped and hung out. And since sophomore year I no longer went to school with him and he ended up doing home schooling. However, fast forward 5 years since him and I met and I adopted my introverted friend, him and I our still friends and we still hang out and communicate regularly. He recently made a video for me thanking me for helping him come out of his shell and for being a loyal friend.

It sounds weird, but this is a new problem with my girlfriend of almost 1 year. We bonded over the many things we have in common, but not by discussions, so it started becoming a problem now that we're ""routine"". I think the best way is not to describe it, but to give examples:

\[me talking about something I watched\] ""It's one of the best things I've watched. I actually took some time to think about it and I think the reason is how it resonates with my romantic views of the world and it speaks in a way that fulfills those. It was honestly a bit embarrassing exposing that side of myself, and also seeing how easily I was manipulated"". Her: ""Hmm I see. I have a favorite episode too"". End of conversation.

\[she texting a friend that I'm sure by now is Ni dom\] ""Ok I'm done, I'll reply him later. He keeps over analyzing stuff and going deeper and deeper and he never stops"" Coincidentally it was also about a piece of media. 

I feel so shut down, because I find it fascinating exploring ideas and imagining scenarios, or literally just having a discussion to understand a different point of view, with 0 intentions of conflict. When she brings up topics, it always feels like a trivia one liner that ends quickly. It's often about other people (not in a gossip way), which honestly I couldn't care less. Like, I love my sister, but I don't wanna talk about what she did yesterday.

One day I tried to explain that to her in the most roundabout way I could possibly think of, and she said she liked getting lost in ideas too, but either she understood something different or I don't know how to push her buttons.

I had feelings for him for a long time but we never really had a chance. We would be separated for whatever reason and then either one of us would be in a relationship. 

I was always confused with his mixed signals. I would be sure that he had a crush on me.. only then he would be so lazy with texts. 

Now(after 5years) I finally realized that it wasn't just wishful thinking. Please tell me if I'm wrong..

We always had chemistry and were a little flirtatious to be just friends. He remembers everything I say and is very observant (like the typical isfp). One day, he came to my town in the middle of the night because he had something important to say. I kept asking him what it was but he just kept drinking and left..(When I asked him later he said he forgot) Very slowly we started to hold hands and he would put his arms around my waist when we walk together for hours. 

I made him something for valentines day and still nothing really happened. We can't see each other because of the corona virus here. Although I'm the type of person who tries to hide her feelings, I'm really trying to express myself to him.. The thing is.. I'm still not sure what he wants for us. If he would rather be friends, I wouldn't dare risk making us awkward. 

Any advice on isfp relationships would really help. I sometimes feel like he isn't making a move because he's not into me 'that' much. He doesn't text much and it's not like we can see each other regularly(like same college or town) so it's so hard to make something happen.

isfp,"**Things she has said herself:**

\- I have many moments when I don‚Äôt believe in myself. I worry about the future days and have times when I feel anxious. I would sometimes also feel like I don‚Äôt have confidence in affirming myself.

\- It might be because I'm a perfectionist, but I'm very strict with myself. That's why I think I'll never be satisfied with myself. Is there anything in this world that is perfect or complete? It‚Äôs a never-ending repetition of finding my weaknesses and developing.

\- I really don't know how to feel satisfied. There are still too many things I wanna do. I'm always wishing to make something new.

\- I don't want to rely on anybody when I'm having a difficult time. The reason being that, in the future, if I'm having a hard time and that person isn't there, then I would collapse. My mom and my friends won't be able to always be by my side. Each have their own difficulties to deal with too. That's why I either write by myself or listen to music or unwind by cleaning.

\- My personality may be what people think about it, but rather than being a person that other people have branded me as, I want to be a good individual who thinks for herself

\- Because of the people in my life, I feel like I am able to cheer up and hang in there every day instead of worrying about the future.

\- There are so many times that I feel sorry for being lacking, and those are the times that I strengthen my resolve to work towards being more reliable.

\- I have the type of personality that will devote one's self entirely into one goal, so while I do have a big picture drawn up, for now, I want to clear every single one of the goals I have in front of me

\- There were times when I was too busy that I didn't know how the day went by, but if I look at the pictures taken later, I feel like I can experience the atmosphere and emotions of that time again

\- If you feel like your dreams aren't coming true or if you've reached your limits, I think it's important to not let that make you feel anxious and to make time to look back on things that truly make you feel happy. And there are times when it's important to be strict on yourself, but rather than just thinking about your future, you should give yourself room to breathe, and be patient. It's good to not be too strict on yourself

\- Learn a way to believe in yourself. Just by having the desire to do something is already a beginning. From there, you can find what you can do well, and if you really enjoy that process, then won't that be enough? Don't blame yourself, find solace in you.

\- When my mood is bad, I‚Äôd console myself with Amy Winehouse music. When I want to be excited, I‚Äôd entrust myself to Rihanna. I enrich myself with the music of many great artists.

\- There‚Äôs no single method to achieve your dreams. Grab opportunities in the different forms they come in.

**Other info:**

\- She often says, ‚ÄúSome things never change‚Äù and always repeats things about how people should love themselves and do what they truly want to do. For example, she tried listening to what her parents wanted her to do as a future career, but couldn‚Äôt do it and ended up taking her own route with a career in a risky industry (like arts, entertainment, etc)

\- She‚Äôs very shy, but used to be even more shy back then. She‚Äôs learning to express herself better and not care too much about what people think. She has once thought something along the lines of, ‚ÄúWhy am I hiding myself?‚Äù

\- She‚Äôs interested in fashion that isn‚Äôt from her own generation (retro). She has also been into fashion since she was young, and has good sense of style.

\- She is extremely introverted and is a homebody

\- She struggles with anxiety and gets panic attacks from time to time.

\- Loves animals and children 

\- She likes learning new things 

\- She‚Äôs really soft and sensitive, but doesn‚Äôt like to openly show moments where she feels like crying

\- She‚Äôs very nitpicky with herself, doing things like criticizing her performance of things, her appearance, etc. and notices minor details she needs to improve on.

\- At first impression, almost every person says she comes across very cold, bitchy, and even arrogant (mostly from her resting face). However she‚Äôs really kind-hearted and acts somewhat like a baby.",1584323866

isfp,"I think the title is a bit misleading, so to elaborate: 

I started dating one of my ISFP friends (note I don't actually know if he's really ISFP, that's just gathered from what I've observed, could be ISTP) of 2 years, but we're long distance and the problem is I feel like he's still awkward and shy to open up and speak openly about his feelings. I can see he's very uncomfortable expressing himself in words and is super self conscious about how he acts and what he says and he can express him self most comfortably through art or anything that isn't too serious or out of his comfort zone. He almost never talks about his feelings, ever, but I have seen him open up to one of our friends and she's the one who told me for him that he liked me and the one that pushed us together. 

I really like him, I enjoy being with him and I want him to feel more comfortable around me but I can see that he really struggles with that and before we started dating he only talked to me through group chats or servers (Discord) where there were other people and never through DMs because he felt he was violating my privacy, and even asked for permission to DM me. I just feel like communication is going to be a bit difficult for us because he's so shy and awkward and doesn't outwardly express his feelings, but I want him to be able to feel comfortable doing that with me. 

We never seriously discussed our feelings - or at least, I did explain mine in a group chat that was made by the friend I mentioned, and he read it but he never responded and only spoke to the friend because that was what he was most comfortable with. Then after that he posted a drawing for me in our server (he draws me a lot) which said ""would you be the buttercup of my life"" and he apologized for being bad at expressing his feelings and only being able to express them through drawing. I am glad that he is comfortable to do that, but I feel like in order to make progress he needs to open up much more and feel comfortable talking about his feelings to me. 

I think he's just so scared and anxious about being in a relationship and not used to being loved, to the point where he just doesn't know how to express it and is just really awkward about it. I want to make him feel more comfortable, I want him to be able to rant to me about anything and to be able to ask me for advice on anything, to ask me to support him etc. easily. I feel like he's scared of serious discussion because it makes him feel unsure of what to say or really aware of what he's saying, in general just really uncomfortable or nervous or awkward etc. 

I'm not really sure about how other ISFPs would view my situation, but I would really love some advice on it. I actually have quite a few ISFP friends but I would love to hear the opinions of people who can apply their understanding of MBTI to help me draw his inner self out more. I understand that relationships aren't a matter of MBTI type, but in this case I want to know if any other ISFPs can relate to how he is feeling and is able to tell me how to go about my problem.",1584012576
isfp,"First off, I‚Äôm not entirely sure if this is a tendency for Isfps in general, or if it‚Äôs due to me being enneagram 9, but time and time again, I notice that i‚Äôm constantly resorting to unhealthy habits when it comes to keeping inner peace. It tends to be due to conflict or uncertain feelings towards a situation, but sometimes it happens (mostly when i‚Äôm in a loop) just because of procrastination.

I avoid the problem. To the point I don‚Äôt think about it, and cruise hoping that it‚Äôll go away.
When the problem is so big that I can‚Äôt really ignore, i‚Äôll make up excuses not to go out or do anything: i haven‚Äôt taken a shower; i‚Äôm sleepy, etc. I grow numb to my own bodily needs, like hunger or going to the bathroom.
The thing is, it‚Äôs not even worth it, because I‚Äôm uncomfortable and torturing myself on the issue the entire time I‚Äôm trying to avoid it. It usually takes a bit for me to go: Aha! Action is the answer; and then snap out of it, but yeah.
I keep trying, but I can‚Äôt break the avoidance (self-neglect) loop.

As for self-sabotage (with self-neglect), this tends to happen when i‚Äôm really high-strung, or really angry and frustrated over something. I think it‚Äôs just bad anger management (hi! I‚Äôm a 9!); but instead of taking it out on something (an activity, yelling, writing, starting a fight) I somehow always punish myself, hoping it‚Äôll make the other person feel bad for making me angry in the first place. Martyr complex? I‚Äôd deny myself food or water, would scratch and beat myself, draw myself and tear it to pieces.
The worst of it usually happened during my teens, but I still see traces of it today. It‚Äôs usually subtle, but I would give up on opportunities, cancel trips for myself, disconnect with certain friends, etc. 
Since this is the issue that is causing the most unconscious (i usually only realize it after the fact) damage; this is the thing I‚Äôd like to learn to break out of the most. Have any of you had similar experiences with this? Is it just personal?",1583951328
isfp,"This is a gush post, you have been warned

So lately, I‚Äôve been thinking a lot a people as of late. I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that, well, I have problems with judging types, because they are so structured and can be so judgmental, ESPECIALLY xxTJ types. I also dislike the so-called ‚Äúintuitive bias‚Äù that‚Äôs unfortunately so common in the MBTI community. Moreover, I realized the types of people I liked the most were really chill people who don‚Äôt complain about everything, and just like going with the flow, who don‚Äôt complain about change, and are generally optimistic. Lastly, they weren‚Äôt concerned about the mainstream and popularity and just wanted to live a nice life. And I realized that unfortunately, very few personality types fit those criteria. Ultimately though, I came down and realized ISFPs fit all these criteria to a T. Here‚Äôs all the reasons I love ISFPs so much

-ISFPs are generally optimistic, and don‚Äôt constantly go ‚Äúthis sucks, it‚Äôll just get worse‚Äù. A refreshing turn of pace IMO from the world right now
-ISFPs are not political, and don‚Äôt care about political debate. This is important because this world is being ruined by politics. Yet ISFPs don‚Äôt care much, and just want to enjoy nice things.
-ISFPs are introverts which means they don‚Äôt care about popularity. A common point I hear about why sensors are apparently so bad is because they‚Äôre superficial, yet this isn‚Äôt true at all for ISFPs (and ISTPs too but that‚Äôs beside the point). They don‚Äôt care if they, OR others are fancy or clean, they just want to go their own way.
-ISFPs are very open-minded and willing to give things most others wouldn‚Äôt dare touch a chance.
-ISFPs are EXTREMELY respectful. Whether it‚Äôs of people or opinions, you‚Äôll hardly meet an ISFP who disrespects.
-Through all this, ISFPs are extremely creative and amazing at art and music to the point of it being a stereotype. It‚Äôs amazing to have all these abilities ON TOP of amazing talent
-Though they are a feeling type, they‚Äôre not moralistic and just want to live a comfortable, happy life. Because of this, they‚Äôre not as easily offended as NF types and are much more relaxed
-ISFPs, in my opinion, are the least pretentious type. They don‚Äôt care about big brain smart stuff and definitely aren‚Äôt smug about it. In this day and age, they‚Äôve become one of the least conformist types. They‚Äôre not like ‚ÄúIF YOU LIKE THIS MAINSTREAM MOVIE YOU ARE A SHEEP WHO SUCKS‚Äù like INxx types, ESPECIALLY INTx types can be, but also aren‚Äôt all ‚ÄúIF YOU ARE NOT IN THE MAINSTREAM, YOU‚ÄôRE WEIRD AND I DON‚ÄôT LIKE YOU‚Äù like ESxx types, ESPECIALLY ESxJ types. They‚Äôre respectful of both sides (remember what I said about respect) and are much more willing to give new things a chance regardless. This could be why so many cool people I‚Äôve made friends with, when I type them, a lot of them are ISFPs. xxFPs in general are not pretentious, being some of the nicest, and most open-minded of all types. When you combine lack of concern for popularity (introversion) with the perceiving trait, you end up with types that don‚Äôt care about fanciness and just want to live a simple life. At the same time. ISFPs are more accepting of others than most introverts, and will gladly allow others to join in with them if they want. ISFPs are alternative, not classical, others can actually understand them, and they wish to join the mainstream and obscure, rather than tear them apart between imaginary lines. They ARE emotional and often criticize themselves more than others. However, it‚Äôs important to cherish our emotions, and this is what a lot of thinkers miss. Who cares if ISFPs are supposedly ‚Äúartsy-fartsy‚Äù, at least they aren‚Äôt afraid to express themselves and be true to who they are, which is sadly rare with most others. To quote Bubbles, they‚Äôre not dumb, they just like nice things that make them happy.
-This is anecdotal, but I decided to have my friend type themselves. I forever assumed they were an ENTP or ESTP based on their tastes and demeanor. But they actually typed themselves as an ISFP. It was at that moment that I realized why I love ISFPs so much. It‚Äôs because whilst they can express themselves in a wide variety of ways, they are ultimately not afraid of being very different and going against the status quo. They are fun, but also different.
-And lastly, but most importantly, ISFPs are, in my opinion, the least judgmental of all personality types. In this age of mental illness and cyberbullying, this is amazing. ISFPs are that one type that won‚Äôt judge you for your work ethic, won‚Äôt judge you for your opinions, won‚Äôt judge you for your values, won‚Äôt judge you for your looks, and most importantly, won‚Äôt judge you for being who you are. What a lot of SJWs miss when they say ‚ÄúI DON‚ÄôT JUDGE PEOPLE, I‚ÄôM NOT RACIST‚Äù, yet then they judge others for having different values and opinions, and that, especially these days, has become as bad as simply being racist, because you won‚Äôt open up and actually accept them for being true to themselves. Diversity of opinion, not just diversity of skin. Repeating some points said earlier, ISFPs are not concerned about popularity, not concerned about moral superiority, not concerned about a specific detail connecting wrong, and not concerned about if you are or aren‚Äôt clean or dirty in style or humor. ISFPs just want to relax and have fun, and after all, isn‚Äôt that what we all secretly desire inside? A lot of more critical types will say ISFPs have bad taste, but really, they just like comforts. I like comfort food like macaroni and cheese and ice cream, and as much as other more refined types may hate to admit it, you probably do too. Put simply, ISFPs teach us what it means to be alive. One song that reminds me so much of the ISFP lifestyle is by one of my favorite groups, Queens of the Stone Age, which is called ‚ÄúGo With the Flow‚Äù, which, look it up if you haven‚Äôt heard it, but it‚Äôs definitely a song I personally aspire to live up to.

For all these reasons, and more, ISFPs have become my new favorite type. They just feel so genuine compared to everyone else these days, and I consider myself an honorary ISFP.
And it‚Äôs perhaps because of all the great traits of ISFPs that this world needs more than ever, that ISFPs have finally received the success and recognition they deserve. They went from, according to one study, one of the poorest and most likely MBTI types to be unemployed, to stars like Billie Eillish. Even if I don‚Äôt like her music much, I still respect her and appreciate her creativity, and hope others like her can continue to succeed. Because of all this as well, I consider myself an honorary ISFP, even if I‚Äôm not really sure I am one (16Personalities says I‚Äôm an INFP, but fairly low on intuition, which basically means I‚Äôm BARELY an ISFP. Most other tests say I‚Äôm either an INFP, ENFP, or INTP). Regardless of what type I am, I‚Äôve always found ISFPs charming, but once I did research on them, they‚Äôve now become who I aspire to be. :)",1583862930

The one I dislike the most is that ISFPs are shallow and incapable of being introspective and having philosophical conversations and are purely concerned with superficial topics.

It all started with this girl in middle school. (She) asked me out and we began to date. We barely ever hungout or even talked in person. We would text back in forth about questions we had about eachother other, what's your favorite food, drink etc. She broke up with me after that year and it made me cry. I felt as tho I still loved her. We starting hanging out this past summer, at the time I still had feeling for her. It didn't workout and she cut me out of her life. This made me depressed. I made her the soul purpose of life / happiness. We just recently talked about my feelings for her and now I feel a lot better / different, Im still depressed but I feel my mindset has changed and I feel as tho when I talk to guys it sounds gay / comes off gay. I know im not gay.

Between the time I was in love with her and had put my whole happiness in her. I talked with many girls, I feel I never liked any of them because I was still in love with her.

Social/Miscellaneous:


- I can go up to any person who seems extroverted that I've never talked with before and just start talking with them, but going up to introverted/quiet people and talking with them is a struggle for me, even though talking with people, learning about them, and getting closer to them is an exhilarating experience for me, but I almost never do it


- I joke a lot, and I make these jokes on a whim often


- I don't get nervous during presentations or while a large amount of people are paying attention to me, in fact, I get thrilled by it because it can possibly make people I don't find approachable approach me instead


- I dislike small talk unless it leads to joking or actual talking, but I'm not bad at it


- I'm friends with people with VERY varying personalities and traits


- I very easily and very often adapt to whoever I am with, however, this often leads to me being very quiet around quiet people even though I often really want to talk to them, but I just don't know how to


- I can handle criticism and insults very well


- However, I get very self-conscious if I feel like I did something as little as talking over a friend on accident who sounds annoyed after I did so


- According to friends, I say sorry WAY too much and don't say ""no"" enough


- I literally can't hold a grudge at all, but I often get worried other people still hold a grudge against me if I did something they didn't like


- I can't talk about my emotions in detail, and I almost never do (I think I've only talked about my emotions several times these last two months in the last couple years)


- I don't think I've ever been angry with anyone, just mildly annoyed, and I apparently don't show my annoyance very well because no one has seemed to ever notice it correctly


- I often really like people with the same interests as me but am otherwise very vague about why I like certain people



Annoyances:


- Micro-managing


- Bootlickers


- **People assuming things about me based on who hang out with**


- The ""we're all in this together""/""the entire class should be punished due to a small amount of people"" mindset



Interests:


- Playing the piano


- Listening to music (not sure if it's relevant, but I like all kinds of music but obsess over one to three songs, then get bored with them. I usually listen to rock)


- Watching YouTube (educational comedy is usually my favorite genre) and animated sitcoms


- Politics and political ideologies (some thrown around words describing my beliefs are ""liberty"", ""environmentalism"" and ""individualism"")


- I enjoy talking with people, learning about them, and getting closer to people the most by far

(just a disclaimer: this is my first post since a very long time, and english isn‚Äôt my 1st language...)

I am a ISFP male and I often catch myself doing the following:
in a discussion or in an argument, especially if a point is very strong, I often take the opposite side just to challenge the person or to make them consider another perspective. I do that mostly to people I care about. 
What I find strange though is that even if I perfectly agree with them, I still will take the opposing side and, for the duration of the argument, even tend to believe my new ‚Äûopinion‚Äú.

Now I wonder if that is a typical ISFP thing to do, maybe to somehow try to create harmony between Ideas in the head of the other person.

I‚Äôm at ISTJ I‚Äôve been with my ISFP boyfriend for a little over a year and last week we had a pretty bad argument (if you can call it an argument). He recently finished college and was spending a lot of time with his college friends and I felt like I was being put to the side, so I confronted him about it and let him know how I felt. This happened last Saturday, on the 29th of February. 

It‚Äôs been a week and I haven‚Äôt heard from him since. Of course I‚Äôve tried contacting him again, asking if he wants to fix things, tried calling him but my calls get ignored too, last night I even drove to his place so we could talk things out, but he left home just before I arrived. 

Usually, he takes some time to himself after an argument, to properly coordinate his thoughts before getting back to me. But this is the longest he‚Äôs ignored me for and I‚Äôm not sure how long more I can wait :( 

I‚Äôm feeling pretty lost right now. I talked to my mom about it (because mom‚Äôs know best, right?) and she thinks I deserve better and should break up with him. But this is the first relationship I‚Äôve been in where everything just fits into place like it feels right. Plus, even if I wanted to break up with him I can‚Äôt do it through text, so I‚Äôd have to meet him to do it but I can‚Äôt do that either since he doesn‚Äôt want to see me :/

Is this just how you guys are? I‚Äôve heard you guys tend to dread making plans and much prefer face to face interactions rather than texts and that‚Äôs a big one for you guys. Maybe he just doesn‚Äôt really contact first because he is so introverted, but we‚Äôve been together for almost 8 months.

My beliefs are very religious, I am a devout Christian, but I have a sort of live and let live attitude if I cannot convince them of my beliefs. 

I'm quiet around strangers, slightly less reserved around friends, and fully expressive around family. If my family is threatened or insulted, I will hold everything back not to lash out. 

When I zone out, I often go from thinking of something trivial, to going to existential topics. For example, I stare at something circular or round and go ""Hm, round thing, so many things are round, the Earth, the sun, the moon...there are sooo many things that are round...so many round things in such a big universe..."" Maybe not quite to that extent, but that's just an example of how my brain trails off. That's what makes me think I'm an INFP, but I don't think of the future, not beyond fantasies, which leads me to say ISFP. What do you all think?",1583287338

While I haven't developed any artistic skills (I keep telling myself... ""yet""), I told her how the paintings I dream up tell a story, but it is usually dark because they usually stem from my fears or some morbid part of me. After I verbally painted one of them to her she actually said, ""maybe you need to go talk to a therapist about that stuff"", which is of course very sweet but that really isn't what I meant.

&amp;#x200B;

I met with a personality profiler who typed me as either ISFP or INTJ (both types share the same cognitive functions), though she was leaning further toward ISFP.

I've been reading about both types over the last few weeks, and I could honestly see myself either way based on the cognitive functions. I want to ask you guys some questions that I think could help determine my type. I'm not expecting you to answer everything, but these are some things I'm curious about. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Do you spend a lot of time in your head? If so, what do you think about?

\- Do you ever space out while someone is talking to you, or is it easy to focus?

\- What does ""living in the moment"" look like for you? 

\- What are some examples of using Se aux in your daily life?  

\- What types of situations drain your energy? How do you recharge? 

\- Are you good at driving, or does it give you anxiety?

\- Are you good with navigation, or do you easily get lost? 

\- If you had to spend everyday behind a computer screen, would that bother you?  

\- Do you have a goal or ideal that you work towards? What motivates you to be your best self?

isfp,"So, I have this friend that I really care about that I met a little less than a year ago. I immediately recognized her raw potential and passion for change in the community that we share, and was drawn to her sheer unpredictability. In turn, she was very inspired by me and my vision for enacting that change, and likewise valued my erratic lifestyle. We got along super well, and became really close friends both in and out of that community.

In the time since, I supported her as a friend in every way I knew how. When she cried, I was her shoulder. When she wanted to try something new, I hooked her up with the right people and resources to do it. When she was broke, I made sure she had food and safe places to be. When she played at open mics, I was there when nobody else was. I didn‚Äôt expect anything from her aside from her continued friendship and progress on the goals she had set for herself, and never made her feel guilty for accepting help. I was infinitely proud of her in every aspect, and I was humbled to be able to support her through her setbacks.

Unfortunately, where I felt I was treating her as a friend and an equal, she felt that I was being patronizing and overbearing. She also admitted that she had been idealizing me, and that she felt inferior due to a number of power imbalances between us, such as age, wealth, experience, connections, romantic success, and seniority in our community. I hadn‚Äôt considered those things a factor of our friendship, but upon reflection, I realized that I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to support her in the same way if not for my own support, resources, and experience.

To make matters worse, she had been manipulated by people in the past who did kind things for her in expectation that she would return the favor somehow. I had not done this to her, nor did I intend to, however she assumed that it would only be a matter of time until I did. This concern was mainly sparked because I had previously confided in her about my own self-doubts, which as an ENFP are that I feel I‚Äôm worthless without other people to rely on, and that I feel manipulative because I understand how to navigate the bigger social picture when others don‚Äôt.

She hadn‚Äôt previously expressed any of these concerns to me at any point, and instead they all bubbled up to the surface all at once, sparked by the tragic death of an incredible leader within our community that was close to both of us. I felt like I got hit by a truck full of doubt confirmations and accusations, and I reeled back hard and tried to explain myself. Unfortunately, she felt that I was trying to gaslight her experiences instead. I didn‚Äôt know what else I could say that wouldn‚Äôt further that assumption, so we agreed to take some time apart to process.

Unfortunately, the aforementioned death left a void in our community as big as the one in our hearts, and action needed to be taken quickly to enact the changes we wanted to see. I had already stepped up into a leadership position myself a couple months back, and the time was ripe to make a move if we were serious about backing up our idealistic talk. After a week apart, I called upon those who shared our vision (including her) to follow through on what we believed, and requested everyone‚Äôs input to draw from in order to really refine what we were doing.

Big mistake. It was too much too soon apparently, and she blew up on me. Now I feel like our friendship is unsalvageable, and I feel extreme regret for the fact that my hand in our community may now make her feel unwelcome in it. My immediate thought was to step down and leave entirely for her sake, but others convinced me that I needed to stay and ride it out for the good of the whole. I don‚Äôt know how to reconcile this. I care about her dearly, but I don‚Äôt know how to express that care in a way that is suitable for her. I can‚Äôt help but imagine this is what a scorned mother must feel like.

What should I do? I normally have everything so figured out already, but I‚Äôm seriously at a loss here. It feels wrong to leave her behind, but it doesn‚Äôt seem possible for me to approach her.",1582834559

After two months of him coming to see me in my office every day, I finally stopped being annoyed by him and started realizing I like him.  (I'm an INTJ, in case the last sentence didn't make that obvious.)  Unfortunately, he's in a relationship.  That being said, I definitely get the feeling he's interested and wondering if things aren't so great with his relationship. (I've gotten that sense, though he seldom says anything specific.)  He goes out of his way to talk to me at least a couple times a day (which usually involves him climbing multiple flights of stairs) and always seems to want to do things together (of course, they're always work-related, which makes it entirely plausible that misreading things).  This has been going on for several months now.

I know asking a bunch of strangers on the internet isn't going to help me to get to the bottom of this, but I am also now on an emotional roller coaster because his behavior is both very endearing and thoroughly confusing.

isfp,"I have this ISFP friend, we'll call him Luke, and I am an ENFJ. Me him and two other friends became a friend group a year ago. Things were cool and he was really fun to hangout with. Then we had December break and things started to change. He is got way more hostile and gets really aggressive or sensitive sometimes. 

Whenever Luke makes jokes, and sometimes they're good, they're just so forced and old, but he thinks they're hilarious. If we ask him to explain the joke he just says you guys are girls you don‚Äôt understand which rubs me the wrong way. 

What I don‚Äôt understand is why all of a sudden he is acting like this. He was so sweet and we all had a lot of fun together. It was pretty difficult for any of us to talk to him alone tho.

I have been thinking about it for awhile and it might be because me and my two others friends have gotten closer than we were before. (A little background info me and my two other friends had our intermittent friendships for the last three years and what mainly brought us together was hanging out with Luke) we did sort of draw away from him but not intentionally.

When I have tried to ask Luke what‚Äôs wrong he doesn‚Äôt give me a answer besides oh nothing,I‚Äôm tired or I‚Äôm bored.
But he still craves attention, like really craves it. Which isn't something to be mad at in itself, but he will get upset when we don't give him it. He takes stuff from us and refuses to give it back, he uses very childish tactics to try to get attention. When we don‚Äôt do what Luke wants like even as small as a high five he reverts to taking stuff from us and doesn‚Äôt give it back. (Not major things)

I'm aware that Luke's probably hurting and maybe he feels unloved but he can be really hurtful, and if I'm being honest its just really irritating and annoying. 

Another thing is that Luke blames us for our drifting, he thinks its our fault that we're not paying attention to him or talking to him, and granted it probably was partially our fault, but he is being very hard to deal with (purposely) and rude.

I have no idea what to do if the answer is to cut him out I‚Äôm not sure how but if the answer is to try and salvage the relationship (which idek if that's possible anymore) then I don‚Äôt know how to do that either.

After a couple of weeks he started cancelling on me so I basically said to him that it's ok of he has a better offer but just be up front and tell me rather than making plans and cancelling. He came over immediately and it turned out he was really ill so I ended up looking after him. We chatted for ages about everything and agreed kind of to not see other people. 

Last night he was over and we were cuddling and his watch buzzes, a notification from a dating app. This kind of upset me a bit but I guess notifications don't mean you're using them I said to myself and I didn't bring it up.  I did however, push, a bit later into the evening to get him to describe our situation and he said we're good friends, not really what I wanted to hear but it's a good description. He also made a joke about leaving if we didn't have sex which hit a proper nerve, I went straight on the defensive and childishly said 'well bye then, friend' he immediately reasurred me. It kinda made me realise though I don't want to be just friends but also, it's only been a short while. 

In my infinite tired wisdom, I took it upon myself to invite him for a lunch chat and coffee today to which I thought he would decline. He immediately changed all his plans to come through and have lunch with me. Its a shame because I kind of chickened out until the last minute and just ended up being very blunt and said something to the effect of 'I don't know how much longer I can continue to JUST be friends' and he asked what would change if we were more and I really didn't have an answer. He said he'd think about it, whatever that means. 

He's never had a girlfriend, just casual hookups here and there. I get the impression he really likes me but I dunno if this whole commitment chat has maybe pushed him away.

He's coming over tomorrow and I don't really know what to do. Do I just forget the conversation ever happened and just go with the flow knowing all my cards are on the table and I'll get an answer eventually or do I push for an answer even if it's one I don't want before I catch proper feelings.",1582576432

isfp,"(30+M) I've considered myself an ISTP for quite a while now (years), but studying the functions has made me start second guessing. Given that both types have the Se-Ni functional middle pairing, I don't imagine much clarification can be gained there. That leaves Ti vs Fi and Fe vs Te.

My understanding is:

Ti, informed by previous experience, provides a focus on intrinsic drives that largely stem from a desire to find the most individually effective way of accomplishing some task. An example being a computer programmer that types a whole new code to solve a problem instead of going the 'copy, paste, edit as needed' route. It is a subjective, ""my way works, and it works best for me"" function.

Fi relies on an individual's values to decide how to act. This makes it highly subjective to the individual since 2 Fi users may hold very different values (which I assume are informed by the individuals upbringing/experience). Similar to how Ti concentrates on individual solutions to individual tasks, Fi weighs different values against different situations.

Fe is generally written as craving harmony with others, but it also seems like it might be the driver for status-driven people. Being that it is the inferior function in this case, I would most expect it to be demonstrated as seeking harmony more often than influence.

Te is objective and systematic, but again being the inferior function would likely be demonstrated as gathering information from reputable sources rather than testing hypothesis and findings.

\----------

My mistake, which I think is a common one, was thinking that ""Feeling"" was linked to emotional behavior rather than values and relationships. I see this mistake being made in typing characters, famous people, and type me threads quite frequently.

I still haven't come to a 100% certainty of which functions I use, but I am leaning heavily towards ISFP.

1. I joined the military because I was idealistic and thought I would be freeing the oppressed and helpless (I thought much like Josh Hartnet's character in Black Hawk Down, but Eric Bana's more cynical, and ironically named, ""Hoot"" had it right)
2. The family my wife and I've built comes far and away first with me. \[Expletive\] career, status, and money. I earn money so that my family and I can experience life. I work to live, I don't live to work.
3. When I left my childhood religion as a 20-something, it was first and foremost because the believes conflicted with my deeply held values. I saw a lack of individualism and a lack of personal responsibility within the believes that I couldn't get behind. Only after that initial impulse did I seek out more factual disputes, and only because of push-back from my parents.
4. Which brings me to that inferior function. I definitely look more for objective truth than ""my truth"", I don't necessarily like structure (it can be repressive) but I need structure to get most stuff done, I don't overly care whether people like me or not, and when I coach a team or manage I generally focus less on some vague notion of overall morale and prefer to establish a relationship with each individual such that I can support them on the level they need.

I thought I was an ISTP because

1.  I like to fix things, and I'm obsessively into hockey. But those both stem from Se, and I don't go beyond learning exactly what I need to fix (I can't tell you how a car light switch works, and I don't care to learn, but I can replace it if it fails).

isfp,"hello, just wondering if anyone else on here sometimes feels emotionally exhausted by other people. I don't have any very close friends now and the ones who I am closest to basically just talk about themselves &amp; brush my feelings to the side(and I just recently was able to share anything with them). I'm happy to listen to them and support them with their problems, but it feels like it's almost constant and they almost only talk to me as if I was their therapist or something. It gets very exhausting. 

I find telling most people about my problems never really goes well; I usually either have my feelings invalidated(""you aren't depressed because x,"" ""you're just anxious because of x"") or they just ignore what I'm saying or something. It's making me really dislike my ""friends"" and other people who tell me this stuff. It felt like I could be open with them about how I feel, but after hearing this I am not sure it's worth it. It doesn't surprise me why I keep everything inside &amp; never open up to anyone. Maybe it's because I'm male or I don't share my feelings often, but most people seem to act like my feelings aren't important or just don't exist.

I'm just very tired of all of this, I wish I could turn off my emotions and just be like a robot, but I'm always feeling something. Nothing is really enjoyable right now and everything is starting to irritate me. It's very frustrating, it's like people want and expect me to be a robot who emits happiness and has no feelings so they can feel better about themselves. Maybe it's because I appear emotionless or something so they think I actually am. I am very tempted to just cut contact with most of these people. I feel badly about wanting to do that, but maybe it's a good idea, and I should just focus on finding other friend groups with people who actually care and aren't just using me so they can feel better. Even in normal conversation, I sometimes wonder if these people are even listening to what I say. 

I went off on a tangent sort of but I wonder if anyone relates to any of this. It is very frustrating to feel this way, especially with people who seem like they're empathetic, or at least act this way and act like they're nice people. I used to think of them as nice, but I'm not really sure anymore. Maybe they actually are and I'm just exhausted by them, or maybe they stopped being nice to me after I was honest about how I felt. I don't know, but some people are strange and I'd rather just not deal with deciphering their actions",1582486364

Last week my boss and I had a major misunderstanding. It was launch day for a project I have been working on for the past 4 months. I was all ready to go just waiting around when my boss asked me about another task that we had discussed but I thought that task was due later on, sometime around June. So obviously I didn't have it even close to done. 

I had a discussion with him luckily he is a very rational person and even though he was disappointed he understood it was a misunderstanding. We talked a lot to try and understand each other better. He's definitely a great boss, very supportive, very enthusiastic but sometimes has some lofty ideas and it's difficult for me to grasp immediately. He has taken my feedback when I asked that we talk tactically more often. I feel my other coworkers are more on his level with being able to debate ideas with him and being quick witted but obviously that's not me. I want to be on his good side. I want us to have a good working relationship. 

He told me that he's an ENTP. I am reading conflicting things online about how ENTP and ISFP are dual types but other places reading that we are the worst mismatch that can exist. I know it's possible to make even the most difficult relationships work. What are some things we can do to understand each other better? What can we do so that we don't have misunderstandings like this in the future?  And what can I do to be a better employee to him?",1582310640

So as a result I looked into ISFP videos and there is pretty much NO good content about our type. Wondering if it has anything to do with how our personalities are :) but I have a huge interest in it and I love talking about my own realizations and my own journey of self improvement using MBTI.

We started hanging out with our friends from work and eventually together, alone, just talking. I've gotta confess, up until not that long ago both of us were, pretty severe addicts. My poison was almost a case of beer every two nights and alot of bowl packs, hers was a bottle or two of wine a night and an eight ball of blow every few weeks. She had been and still is with a boyfriend who I guess according to her sometimes and confirmed by myself after confronting him a few times, emotionally and physically abusive.. We've had sex a couple times and I felt like we really bonded and I loved it, but she's super close to me one minute and then reclusive and ghosting the next and I don't get it.

He told me never to contact him
again. His roommate was running an email server for him, and he blocked me.

I decided I didn‚Äôt want to die, so I actually went to a doctor, and got a diagnosis and I got better.

I looked for a phone number for my friend, and tried to explain that I was really sick, and asked if he would at least consider talking to me. I also pointed out that he was, at the time, my only contact with several mutual friends.

He just said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care. Never contact me again for any reason.‚Äù

I'm not sure if this is an ISFP thing or a personal one but I struggle a lot in maintaining an active social media life. For example, I don't like the idea of people knowing about my life, so I dislike using Facebook. I am usually a reddit lurker and even if I've created posts  before, I really think I fail at answering people's comments or connecting with them online. Strangely enough, I can do it very well IRL. 
I do talk a lot with my closest friends IRL online though, but I think I'm really bad at maintaining contact with people without feeling insecure or some sort of pressure when interacting with people online.

The thing is, I like to draw, and sometimes I wish I could find some more willpower into being more active in social media, but overall I am very scared of this internet life. I could just post my stuff and only log in to do that, but I think that'd be rude to people who comment on my stuff. But I know that if I can manage to find a way to counterattack this uneasiness, I'll do it very well, as many things I've overcome in my life. 
If anyone ever felt like they were in a similar spot, is there any advice you could me? It can be some experience that changed your point of view or something like that, since it's how it works for me!!

So, that sent me into a pretty dark spiral of overthinking, and eventually I arrived at the conclusion that I believe in existentialism/optimistic nihilism (basically, objectively/empirically speaking probably nothing has actual objective meaning or value, but from my POV, as me, things do matter to me, so I give them value, which in turn makes these real to me).

An INFJ friend of mine is an amazing person but she also teases people and seduces even if this will hurt others - she is polyamorous and her ESFP partner has self-esteem issues about one single guy and she has tried seducing him (I actually do not know if she does this intentionally of not, knowing her, she might not, she has a hard time with physical boundaries and social codes, but her answer is often that ""They are free to do what they want"" which is a fair point but it's not actually taking care of the emotions of people who might suffer from those choices). 

She also has double standards and does not ALWAYS promote equality of treatment in her actions because even if she says her partners are free, her closest one has no other partner and she speaks about it in those terms: ""He only has me, I am the only one in his eyes"" and she has expressed jealousy when he actually got closer to someone else. 

She also has told me about a guy (who loved her for a long time and had his heart broken in the process) who was interested in me: ""If you want to get close to him, you have to be sure, because he is fragile"" which is actually patronizing and it almost feels like she does not want him to move on (but I guess that is theoretical).

But she has never looked more free in her own body then when she was disguised as a ""prostitute"" (her word) at the New Year eve and went around seducing everyone, but then kissed her three partners one after the other and said ""I kissed them all oh my god what did I do"" I mean they all agree to it so I guess it is okay but it feels weird because it felt like she enjoyed the very fact that it could have been hurtful. And this night she looked very bright and happy, which made me both feel weird and feel glad for her.

So that is stressful because I hate the very fact of hurting others and her vision of freedom of the individual is that they should be able to do what they want with their bodies (but it does not pan out exactly like this for the people she is or has been seduced by, as she tends to kinda try to have a word in every action they take) while my vision is that you have to watch out so as to never be hurtful in who you choose to be with, so that the well-beings of most people are respected.

I have no idea how to solve this issue. She is otherwise really smart, helpful, dedicated and funny and it is starting to get to me. This was already an issue with my ex (my love for him and my value of his freedom to be himself vs my values of limiting hurt as much as possible - he was hurtful). What are your thoughts on this issue? Thanks in advance!",1581159711
isfp,"For me, role models are a huge part of my identity formation. I grew up in an unpredictable and unreliable home. So it was naturally for me to look for role models and guidance without.

I always looked to pop stars and celebrities because they were the only source of positivity I had somewhat of an access to growing up poor. 

But now that I understand my personality, I realize how important it is to have role models other than celebrities to look up to. I‚Äôve been getting into art history and found muses within many great artists.

I mean, I‚Äôve spoken to isfp‚Äôs in the past and some have mentioned that they don‚Äôt care for celebrities or muses and that they tend to find inspiration within themselves. But I think my Se tends to be inspired by what‚Äôs around me while my Fi tried to tie it back to myself to see how I relate to that which inspires me. 

I am interested in more progressive and intellectual isfp‚Äôs. I don‚Äôt really like how most well known isfp‚Äôs are pop stars and actors. Not that I‚Äôm against Hollywood or anything like that.

As an enneagram 5, I just value depth and intellectual expression and would like to find other isfp‚Äôs with similar thought patterns that might inspire me.

It makes sense that I‚Äôd recognize myself so much in ESFPs, except that I don‚Äôt exactly do what ESFPs do for the same reasons, and I‚Äôm quite unaware of my Fi hero (as per daveSP) and people used to label me selfish and weird as a teen/young adult.

We are an LDR couple so we would FaceTime ALL the time and every night we would talk for hours. The thing is, towards the middle of 2019, I started to become distant and always feeling irritated.

We'd text in our distant two-to-three day span, and we've had our occasional deep conversations over the course of a year or so. Lately, I invited him to come and hang out with my roommate and I, and we've all really grown close and gotten along well with each other as good friends.

&amp;#x200B;

This most recent time this person was over, they ended up staying three days in a row. We had really started opening up to each other about more personal stuff, philosophical views, etc. One thing led to another, and then some physical/romantic interactions went about. After that, we grew a bit closer, sharing deep conversations, cuddling and such. After about the third day, we both had the mutual feeling that we were drained and really needed to go spend some alone time. I was surprised, because it usually takes me a shorter time before I'm drained and need my space.

&amp;#x200B;

I think part of all of this is that I tend to really get in my head about things and worry a lot. I'm an ISFP on the more extroverted side, so when I become really comfortable around someone, I tend to be more talkative. The other ISFP is still more so on the quiet side, and stays that way, even with close connections. I'm usually good about staying detached from people and things, but this most recent time spent together has brought about the dreaded 'feelings'. I'm afraid that I might have scared him off with my opening up more or just the situation in general. Neither of us have reached out and talked to each other yet. I'm worried that maybe the friendship is ruined, or worse: something more will happen and both of us will have to be vulnerable with each other. I'm in a state of confusion almost, and even though they are very similar to me, I don't really know where their mind is at exactly or if maybe they feel the same way?

She‚Äôs really cool. Smart AF, really creative and funny, sweet and kind. I don‚Äôt think her MBTI really matters to my problem, but since it‚Äôs an MBTI sub, she‚Äôs INFP.

I felt like every time I had other plans you took it as I didn‚Äôt want to hang out with you. And I know you said you never wanted to get in the way of my friends but there was multiple times I felt this from you. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs your fault I‚Äôm just saying maybe the level of personal time you need I just can‚Äôt offer.

Me: Hey appreciate the text.

Def not trying to get in the way of your time with friends was just misreading your messaging when i thought u were trying to hang out certain days that you actually werent (literally thought u were hinting toward it and misread the signals) - it was just difficult to plan around and didnt wanna keep getting into that dance. It would have just helped so this exact miscommuncation wouldnt have kept happening where u felt i was trying to get u to hang out with me instead (??? Still so confused u thought this) . It felt like a casual like ‚Äòwhenever we happen to be free‚Äô thing and was trying to explain why it wasnt great for me. Your reaction kinda surprised me and i didnt feel like you were understanding what the concern was so i felt like it was blown out of proportion and i ended up getting ‚Äòshook‚Äô about it too like flabbergasted you got that upset about something that wasnt the case at all , then just went radio silent so i assumed that was the only communication i was gunna get and was like damn that wasn‚Äôt cool at all. 
Like obviously i feel like an idiot when i think youre hinting to try to hang out and u end up having plans with your friends and i epically misread the situation. I know those times youre talking about and thats exactly what i wanted to avoid from continuing to happen. Absolutely not trying to get u to change ur plans to hang out with me instead. I need tons of alone time when im dating and gabby makes fun of me for it ... u just misunderstood as well.

And then out of nowhere I get this big text saying how you feel like a convenience and I just took that as I didn‚Äôt have enough time that you need. I just feel like this is still in the developing stages and this shouldn‚Äôt be an issue. If you want to make plans with me then make plans with me. And if you want to be with a guy that is going to make plans days in advance I‚Äôm sorry but That‚Äôs not me. I just don‚Äôt think that far ahead. Never have and probably never will. 

Me: Yeah i had no idea u were celebrating with ur roomies since you didnt say any of that tillll just now haha. At the time i just thought u were implying ur gunna be alone playing video games and it was a hint to hang out..Literally just a miscommunication. Totally saw your personality style and i tried to make an effort to be a little more like u with the less planning and all i wanted was for u to meet me in the middle so the miscommunications didnt keep happening . I can see now even a little effort to plan a couple days in advance is too much to ask of you so im not trying to push the issue. Early stages of dating , especially now in our 30‚Äôs, is simply figuring out if you can work together to communicate effectively and we both learned thats not gunna happen. I know its been awhile for you but if theres no compromise even early on its pretty obvious to me that this isnt going to go anywhere and thats ok . Wish you the best and hope we can be friends  :)

Him : Well I guess that‚Äôs that. I definitely wish you the best as well.

isfp,"Heyo, wondering your guys' thoughts.

So, I, an ENTP-A (well, I'm close enough that I'd also consider myself ENXP, but that just makes me sound like a special snowflake), and I fell in love with an ISFP-T online about a month ago. Lucky me, over this past month he's started to like me, too! C:

The problem is... I had been lying to him about something. At first, I thought it was a minor issue, but as I had gotten to know him, I realized this was a personal and private issue to him. So... I broke it to him a couple days ago. And, well... he hasn't messaged me since. He's gone dark on all of mutual sites, not going online or posting or anything. For all I know, he's dead (or broke his phone, which is his only access to internet rn).

I've apologized deeply to him a few times, but I know I need to give him space. Heck, I don't even have a way of knowing if he's read my apologies. I know two days isn't long, but I myself have issues in the past when an online friend suddenly disappeared and never responded to me again, and I'm honestly terrified that this will end up like that. He's become basically my world... which I know isn't healthy, but that's neither here nor there.

I know ISFPs (including him, from what I've observed) generally need space after something like this, but how much space? Should I send him occasional messages, continuing to apologize? Do you think there's a chance for us to become close again, or even just for him to message me again, or should I try my best to start picking up the pieces as is?",1580148851

Like many ISFP females, I was very conscious about my appearance and although I didn't have it as bad as some of my companions who were injured as well, I was left totally devastated. The scars made me look like a witch. I also had this weird limp which meant I couldn't do dancing ever again, at least not as well as I did before (I was a performing arts student).

So I quit college and took up a part time job but I felt something was missing in my life. I felt so unhappy. Even though I knew it was ultimately unhealthy for me, I decided to do heavy drinking to ease my inner pains.

isfp,"Hello everyone :) Over the past two years, I've been obsessively trying to determine my personality type, but my insecurity constantly clouds my perspective and I keep on second-guessing who I truly am. I am still paving the road to self-discovery and feel that there are so many layers left to unearth about myself, but I still feel this deep longing to know who I am. I would appreciate if anybody could share their insight into my personality and illuminate aspects of myself that I might be unaware of, based on these observations of myself. Thank you so much, and please let me know if you have any questions or need to elaborate more on certain aspects.

\-I'm very verbally driven and have an uncanny ability to find words that encapsulate the essence of my ideas, and as a writer, I feel that words are my blood, that they intuitively carry a part of me, as if they are my closest friends. But I always think of words and (this is a slightly odd analogy), like thalamus in the brain, ideas constantly bounce to me and naturally spring to the exact words that they need to crystallize into reality. Basically, words fill me with life. I used to be much more visual when I was younger though. However, now it's gotten to the point that I can't even vividly daydream, most of my imaginings are like stories and conversations that I play out in my head (the different roles and voices) but I can't truly visualize.

\-Music is almost always racing through my brain. Even as I read, a song simmers in my mind, and its often random, but sometimes connects to the message or mood of what I am processing at the moment (for instance, if I am reading a story in which two lovers are disconnected, I might be singing a melancholy love song in my head). I also am very good at making connections to what I know/store in my memory? It's a little difficult to express in words, but for example, as I was typing the words ""racing through my brain"" I remembered a song with the exact same lyrics. I also make a lot of associations, particularly with music-in human anatomy class, whenever I thought of the ""occipital lobe"" of the brain, for example, a random song would play in my head every time. Whenever I listen to a song, I might associate it with a book character that I became obsessed with and read about at the time...stuff like that.

\-When I was younger, I loved fashion, something that I know feel ashamed about because it feels so superficial and empty to me now. I especially loved wearing clothing that had a unique/vintage twist to it, like I a turtleneck with a vintage skirt, but now I'm far too insecure to step out my comfort zone, and I""ve actually found a home and love in wearing the same clothes to the point that I no longer feel the need to invest in my appearance, it just feels worthless and shallow.

\-Certain aspects of life captivate me, especially concepts that connect to unveiling the world of mysteries, lore, and magic. For instance, any time I see a YouTube video about moon conspiracy theories, I feel intrigued because I have had a deep connection with the moon since I was little. Anything that entwined concepts of mythology, dreaming, psychology, or ancient folklore intrigues me, especially fantasy and historical novels. Recently, I read a book about the legend of a mermaid saint and I loved it. I love anything ethereal, that pulls me outside of the real world and allows me to explore something new, something mesmerizing.

\-I like to make up my own scientific laws and theories, even if they make no sense whatsoever. I love to imagine being a teacher or a genius whiz and then pulling out markers and coming up with formulas that harbor the secrets of the universe that only I can decode, just for fun. I also am very attracted to bizarre worlds, or simply movies that are unusual. I really love the 1990 movie Mermaids because of the unique perspective of the narrator and how everything ties together like an odd puzzle, meshed with magical moments, depth, but also lighthearted comedy, for example. I also loved Coraline when I was little, I found the other mother's obsession with bugs intriguing and I basically delighted in anything unusual but also interested me.

\-I feel a connection to the past and other time periods, constantly wondering what it would have been like to live during those times. I love to listen to vintage music and imagine characters from the past, read books from the past, and delight in anything that carries old memories because those worlds entice me. I used to wish that I could be a time traveler but I lack the scientific finesse to ever do so :D

\-Even though I always used to march to the beat of my own drum when I was young, today my mom pointed out to me that I am so deeply driven by the fear of what others think of me, to the extent that I""m afraid to take my favorite candy out of a bowl in a public sphere. I still wouldn't ever sacrifice my dreams or feelings to please others (for instance, I have very traditional parents who had an arranged marriage, but I refuse to marry without genuinely loving someone). Still, I am deeply insecure and anxious about how others perceive me.

\-I have this innate desire to connect with others, to unleash myself and form a unique connection with each person, but I'm so painfully shy that I mainly keep everything bubbled to myself, appearing like a melancholic ghost with no hope in humanity. I see each person as a beautiful gift on earth, and I treasure every person that I have formed a relationship with, even those who have hurt me because they inspire me to grow. However, my feelings are so intimate that I rarely ever reveal them, so I like to right long, vulnerable letters addressed to those people in my journals while keeping them shielded forever. Even if someone has wounded me in the past, I still view them as an integral part of who I am and I try to see the goodness in them, although bitterness can sometimes consume me.

\-I'm constantly shrouded in my own insecurities, when it comes to my identity and how I come across in the world. Even though I wish I could unbolt my mind and speak freely, insecurity always plagues me and leaves me like a crunched leaf on the ground, dead and withering and barely functioning. I also keep doubting my potential and who I am. I have a deep self-hatred because a part of me fears that I am truly evil inside. In middle school, gossip and drama consumed me and I sold my soul to try and fit in with others, something that I now bitterly regret because that robbed me away from who I truly am. I also keep having this worry that I'm shallow and superficial inside, driven by materialism. Even though I seek for meaning and truth and goodness in life, I'm worried that deep down I harbor a monster that will one day conquer me, if that makes any sense.

\-I always feel alone. Even in conversation with my closest friends, my sensitivity causes me to question whether or not they truly see me as a friend, and I feel as if I'm drowning in my own emptiness.

\-I always feel this need to entangle outside of myself and stretch my perspective to explore the greater dimensions of this world. Whenever I see the distance of the ocean or the blanket of stars above me, I have this insatiable urge deep within to crawl outside of my perspective because I just feel so in awe. It's this feeling of incompletion, almost. I'm not even sure how exactly to express it, but it consumes me, the desire for infinity.",1579667286

isfp,"Okay, long post here. 

So over the summer (June-August 2019), I got a job at a small organization as a digital media content creator. I‚Äôm a 20y/o student and have been able to build up some skills in photography, video editing, and using Adobe softwares. So my job mostly consisted of these. 

However, since my workplace was a very small organization, I didn‚Äôt have a mentor to guide me through my projects. I was expected to act like an ‚Äúexpert‚Äù since my managers didn‚Äôt have any digital media skills. This really messed me over because they expected ME to come up with the process of how to get things done. When I couldn‚Äôt, I‚Äôd get berated for not being efficient and for wasting time. (Which was true, because I literally got burnt out, but also unfair because I had ZERO support). I‚Äôm very creative and passionate and this was clear with one of the video projects I proposed. But being a xxxP, I struggle with sticking to one creative plan which really impacted my efficiency. And efficiency was one of the main qualities they were looking for when hiring me. 

All in all, I had a super hard time making a logical plan of how to get my projects done and then actually executing that plan (major Te stuff). I was totally burnt out by the end of my summer contract. I used to love filmmaking. It was what I wanted to pursue as a career. But I honestly lost all of my confidence and interest. Not because I lack talent, but because I don‚Äôt know how to deal with things on my own. I realized it would be impossible for me to be a freelancer. 

I was studying journalism but ended up dropping out in September, after completing my first two years. I never wanted to become a journalist so I really don‚Äôt regret the decision. I needed to take a break and rebuild myself so I‚Äôm glad I did that. So that‚Äôs where I‚Äôm at right now but the problem is that I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll ever have the energy to figure out another passion.

Have any of you gone through something similar? How did you get out of it? How can I rebuild my confidence? Do you think I‚Äôll ever feel passionate about anything again?

TL;DR: Had a summer job that required me to come up with my own project plans but my managers were not supportive at all and would constantly point out every mistake I made. I ended up losing all of my confidence and getting burnt out. Now I don‚Äôt know how to rebuild my confidence even though I know I‚Äôm talented. I also feel like I‚Äôm never going to be able to be passionate about something again. I‚Äôm drained.  I‚Äôm looking for advice or someone who‚Äôs been through something similar.",1579539526

isfp,"Hey everyone! I would appreciate hearing people's experiences and opinions on this personalities combination (ENFP and ISFP). -- I am particularly curious and excited about your views as ISFP since I am ENFP and it's precisely because of that that I seek here another perspective to understand things. A bit of clarity. A second opinion. So any input is very much appreciated! 

I have been dating this guy (He is ISFP) for around 5 months now, and while it has been lovely in many ways and we have shared great fun moments together, there have also already been terrible downs. We seem to always end up in conflict after every great adventure. It's almost as if there's no exception to the rule now. Every time we plan something the day goes great and we both make a big effort for not stepping on each other's shoes, we enjoy, love spending time together, miss each other, but at the end of the day we seme to finish wrong quite very often.

I have noticed from the beginning that we both communicate in quite different ways. He's Sensing trait doesn't quite do the trick for me and my iNtuition trait. Better said, it's clearly not a match made in heaven. Which is weird, because I've always been full-on with the whole ""opposites attract each other"". But in this case, it seems that in terms of practicability and every-day discussions, doesn't work well. I read that some ENFP and other N personalities types put a great emphasis on the communication trait (S-N) and often need the same wave-length in that ambit rather than the opposite. -- I believe this might be my case.

But here's the trick. I also have worked so hard for a long time and through previous relationships to become better at understanding other types of communicating. And I simply cannot accept that even tho that seems to be a ""clear"" issue between us, means there's no compatibility or a way to learn to communicate and understand each other better.

With all the struggles we're having I seem to notice a pattern when I compare it with my previous relationships, and I am afraid they seem to be in big part my fault. I overthink everything, idealise and go a bit crazy on the expectations or how I wished things were. Sometimes I recognise this and stop to appreciate what I have and how happy makes me to have him in my life, and how good he is for me and to me. But as soon as I turn the coin to imagine the future and the practicalities of a relationship, the day to day, it seems rather obvious it will not be easy and more prompt to fail and succeed.

The point being, he's so many things I have always wished on someone. He's patient, extremely caring and loving, selfless and very kind. He's also very humble and forgiving, it amazes me every time we have a fight, how he is the first one to try an fix it all. He's the first one to get rid off the anger and come kiss me or talk to me again. - At times it worries me that he does have a tendency to blame everything on himself and say ""I'm sorry. It was my fault"" at every single thing. To the point where I cannot figure anymore whether he actually means that or he simply does it to avoid conflict (which I know he hates. He's ideal day would be zero ""serious talking"" all laughs and ice cream). But again, this I also kinda love. I wished I was like that.

I could go on for pages writing a diary out of it, but I guess all I want is to illustrate to you that to my eyes our problems lie on the way we communicate things. There's clearly not lack of love of enjoyment of each other. Also not to mention how gratifying is to know we share many interests, which makes the relationship always exciting.

I would love to hear your experiences, opinions, perspectives and even more knowledge about the compatibility between ENFP and ISFP.",1579194303

&gt;Michael Kelland John Hutchence was born on January 22, 1960 at Mater Misericordiae Hospital in North Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. His mother Patricia Kennedy, was a former successful Melbourne model turned makeup artist and mother of eleven-year-old Tina when she married Sydney businessman Kelland Hutchence on January 31, 1959.  
&gt;  
&gt;Michael was a very happy child with a big smile for everyone. He just seemed so excited to be alive. Soon after he was born the family moved to Brisbane where his brother Rhett was born. The family returned to Sydney when Michael was three years-old and just days before Michael's 5th birthday in January, 1965, the family departed for Hong Kong where Kell had accepted a position with a company which imported beef from Australia and wines and spirits from France.  
&gt;  
&gt;Michael attended pre-school, Kindergarten and elementary, eventually going on to King George the 5th High in Hong Kong. During those formative years in Hong Kong, Michael proved to be an excellent athlete at certain sports, namely those, which did not involve a ‚Äòteam' or running. He was a superior swimmer and also won several trophies for diving.  
&gt;  
&gt;The music played in the Hutchence household ranged from his parents' tastes; Ella Fitzgerald and Frank Sinatra to his teenage sisters' the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. He studied classical guitar for a short time and the violin which, the way he played it, was excruciating to the ears. At other times he would sit around with his friends singing folk songs when he wasn't involved in Boy Scouts, fencing, judo, or kick boxing. Although he was interested in music, he dreamed of becoming an airline pilot.  
&gt;  
&gt;One of his favourite past-times was visiting his mother and sister on movie sets at Shaw Brothers Studio. He started this at a very young age and instinctively knew to sit very quietly while the actors were doing a ‚Äòtake'. He watched everyone intently, interested in every aspect of movie making.  
&gt;  
&gt;At the age of eleven, he made a recording of Christmas carols for a toy manufacturer. The recording was made to a small disc which was encased by a Santa Clause and sold quite well that Holiday Season.  
&gt;  
&gt;When Michael was 12 the family returned to Sydney and settled into a home in Belrose, New South Wales. Michael used to call it ‚ÄòSausage Hill' because of the weekend barbeques in the neighbourhood. This was a huge culture shock for Michael. His first day at Davidson High was eventful but not very pleasant ‚Äì as the students did not take kindly to his slightly British accent. It was a blessing in disguise however when he met Andrew Farriss who was to become his lifelong friend and business partner.  
&gt;  
&gt;Over a 25 year friendship and a writing partnership that spanned 20 years, together they wrote and performed with the other members of INXS some powerful music that is still heard in motion pictures, on commercials, in clubs and on the radio today.  
&gt;  
&gt;At the age of 15 Michael and his mother left for California. He has said that with the breakup of his parents' marriage he felt that she needed someone and it pained him to think of her alone. He and his mother joined his sister Tina, and her son Brent in a house in Studio City. While his mother continued her work in motion pictures, Michael enrolled into North Hollywood High where he found the student population and instructor/student relationship liberating. He was quite introspective and began to write poetry with a passion. He continued to visit his mother on sets and soaked in the down to earth basics of movie making which possibly helped him later on when it came time to make videos with INXS.  
&gt;  
&gt;Michael and his mother returned to Australia where he continued his friendship with Andrew who was seriously edging toward a career in the music industry. With Andrews' band ‚ÄòDoctor Dolphin' together, there was no place apart from vocals for Michael who did not play an instrument. Gary Beers was playing bass guitar in this first band. Slowly Michael began to expose his poetry to Andrew who was already an accomplished musician.  
&gt;  
&gt;All three Farriss brothers played an instrument. Eldest brother Tim, a guitar player was already performing in a band with Kirk Pengilly. Youngest brother Jon was learning the drums. They eventually formed the line-up that would endure for more than 20 years. After some rehearsals in the Farriss or Hutchence garage, they debuted their band the ‚ÄòFarriss Brothers' on August 16, 1977 ‚Äì Tim's 20th birthday and the day Elvis Presley passed away.  
&gt;  
&gt;The day after Michael completed high school, he and Kirk Pengilly drove across the Nullabour Plains to join the Farriss family and Gary Beers in Perth to give their dream of becoming a band a chance.  
&gt;  
&gt;After a tough ride in and around Perth, playing covers the band made their way back to Sydney. By this time Michael was getting his stage legs. He had a presence that only a select few performers exhibit; a certain something that was a combination of his natural charisma and instinct. The band was spotted by Garry Morris the manager of Midnight Oil who, was too busy to manage them himself but called another manager who was searching for a band. Not only did they get a manager, they changed their name at the same time. Their stage persona was so excessive it seemed appropriate that they should call themselves ‚ÄòINXS'.  
&gt;  
&gt;Chris Murphy's managerial savvy combined with the musical talent of INXS members, with Michael as front man took them to international stardom. Chris, no stranger himself to hard work, had Michael working on his craft constantly. Gig after gig on the road 300 days out of the first year was very humbling. Michael never forgot those days of sharing one order of fish and chips between two people and one hotel room for 6.  
&gt;  
&gt;That same year 1980, they released their first two singles ‚ÄòWe Are The Vegetables' and‚ÄòSimple Simon' and began work on their first album-music by Andrew and lyrics by Michael. Every night after performing in and around Sydney pubs, they would drive to the studio and record. It was a gruelling but satisfying time for the band. Michael and Andrew barely felt the pressure of writing and performing and recording and continued on the same routine throughout most of their careers. With every tour they were writing songs for the next album.  
&gt;  
&gt;Michael's performances began to get noticed by the media and his stage persona was likened to Mick Jagger and Jim Morrison. Their self-titled debut album included their first hit, ‚ÄòJust Keep Walking'. They continued to work hard and just six months later they released a cover of a sixties hit, ‚ÄòThe Loved One' which truly proved to be the perfect set of tempo and lyrics to showcase Michael's sensual phrasing and erotic stage persona.  
&gt;  
&gt;The music journalists lavished praise on the band. One journalist, Jenny Hunter Brown described him thus: ‚ÄúHe stares quite fearlessly, slightly surlily, out at the milling pub crowd. And for a moment Michael Hutchence echoes the late Jim Morrison. ‚Äù She continues; ‚ÄúHe's twenty, fit a fine dancer. He swings side to side with the mike stand as access in a mutant, Austral skank. A great mat of damp curls flopping over one angry eye, he shoots out each rounded word like a rocket off a pad.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;In no time at all INXS were on their way to the international scene in a short leap. In 1984 they embarked on their first world tour. This would mark the beginning of years of constant touring, writing and recording for Michael. In 1985 INXS played to 50,000 fans over three sold out shows in their homeland and dominated the music award shows ‚Äìsomething they continued to do for the next 5 years. In the same year Michael and the band performed for Prince Charles and Lady Diana in a charity concert called‚ÄòRocking with the Royals'.  
&gt;  
&gt;In March of 1986 Michael made his movie debut in Richard Lowenstein's Dogs In Space. Michael played Sam Sejavka, real life punk rock singer from Melbourne in the late seventies who had struggled unsuccessfully with heroin addiction. Richard had written the movie with Michael in mind, positive that he could carry it off. Michael did not let him down receiving admirable reviews for his performance and entering the top ten with a single titled Rooms For The Memory .  
&gt;  
&gt;By the mid eighties Michael was no longer residing in Australia, he had moved back to Hong Kong. This began a habit of Andrew and Michael writing on separate continents. Michael had a habit of writing on anything available as he often misplaced his notebook and rarely was it around when the creative thought reared. It was not unusual for Andrew to send Michael 25 pieces of music.  
&gt;  
&gt;By late 1986 INXS was breaking out in North America with ‚ÄòWhat You Need' on heavy MTV rotation. Michael was becoming a ‚Äòvideo' star as he was a natural in front of a camera.  
&gt;  
&gt;In 1987 INXS recorded ‚ÄòKick' which was to become their most successful album. In September 1988 they swept the MTV Music Awards with ‚ÄòKick'.  
&gt;  
&gt;In 1989 Michael teamed with Melbourne musician Ollie Olsen to record ‚ÄòMax Q'. For the first time  
&gt;  
&gt;Michael explored life in and out of the studio without INXS. It was a critically acclaimed album and a personal success for Michael.  
&gt;  
&gt;Michael then accepted a call from Roger Corman to co-star in his movie ‚ÄòFrankenstein Unbound' starring John Hurt and Brigit Fonda. It was shot in Lake Como, Italy . It was not a commercial success and the critics hated it, but as Michael said, ‚ÄúYou really don't know what the end result is going to be with a movie. You just do your best and trust your director.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;By 1989 Michael's private life was taking a front seat with romantic partners such as Kylie Minogue and Helena Christensen. Although he was taking time off from INXS, he continued to write and listen to new music and absorb ‚Äòlife'. He didn't understand the pre-occupation the press had with his personal life.  
&gt;  
&gt;During this time INXS played the big stage at Wembley, arriving by helicopter to a screaming, throbbing audience of approximately 75,000 and a recorded live performance ""Live Baby Live"".  
&gt;  
&gt;Although future album sales would never hit the heights of Kick, the bands' live performances were still at a premium. They were always known as an exciting live band and INXS always delivered.  
&gt;  
&gt;Michael's base was in the South of France but he also spent a lot of time in the U.S. and London. He was known for taking exotic vacations and was often photographed with celebrities though never sought the limelight. He was proud of the fact that he could walk around unrecognized.  
&gt;  
&gt;That all changed when he became involved with British television personality Paula Yates with whom he had a daughter, Heavenly Hiraani Tiger Lily Hutchence on the 22th July, 1996. The press would not leave him alone and he was placed in the unenviable position of defending himself when the British press dubbed him the man Paula had left Bob Geldof for. He was swept up in the Yates/Geldof child custody wars ‚Äìa position he should never have been placed in. After 18 years of a love affair with the media, he was no match for the onslaught of mud slinging and nastiness from the tabloids.  
&gt;  
&gt;In 1997 he embarked on his last tour with INXS for the very personal album, ‚ÄòElegantly Wasted'; taking a large amount of Prozac to keep on an even keel; he was not being monitored and had only seen a therapist twice. His last shows on the east coast of the U.S. were not his best by far. He had recently signed with a U.S. agent for his acting and his manager had been negotiating with Quentin Tarrantino about a movie beginning in early 1998. But personal problems plagued him. On November 22, 1997, just 4 days prior to beginning the Australian leg of the tour, seemingly despondent over his personal life, Michael took his life in a hotel room in Sydney.  
&gt;  
&gt;Hutchence's long-in-the-works solo album, Michael Hutchence, was finally released in 1999.",1579075217

I'm worried about him so we have long talked through the night for many times. His anxiety developed to panic attack during night and he chose to call me every times it happens. Some nights, I picked up the call and it ended up distracting him by talking random stuff until morning. Some nights I didn't pick up even I was still awake and he told me it's ok and he understood I have my life too. (But it made me guilty not helping him at the same time) 

He texts me all day, maybe the only time he was in silence because I chose to not reply so he doesn't want to bother me but he would text me back immediately after I texted him like he has waiting for me. He always want to make video calls for hours because he needs someone to accompany, I feel super weird since I am a girl who feel so uncomfortable with making long video call, like just set the phone on table or bed and keep doing out things. I feel I need my privacy too. 

He has no other friends and live in different city to me so I can't go see him face to face. He went to therapist already but it doesnt help.

isfp,"Like, all we do is pet cats, chase butterflies or whatever the fuck they say we do. 

Like we're incapable of being aggressive for what we believe in. Guys, Fi is aggressive, it's Fe that is the harmonizing function. And Fi Se is even more confrontational when the time requires it.

And then there's those that say we're adrenaline junkies and are incapable of being introspective because Se=sex or whatever. No, Se means being attentive, and coupled with Fi it means immersing yourself fully into a world of beauty that is materially objective but emotionally subjective.

We can be deep too, just that we don't *intentionally* make it that way. No, not every single piece of music with something that makes you think just slightly is written by an intuitive. There are a lot of ISxP musicians that tapped into tertiary Ni and used the Se/Ni axis to create a sense of realism with traces of absurdity and bitterness.

ISTPs get it a bit better since they have this ""silent badass"" image, but apparently we with a different dominant function are supposed to be all light and fluffy. We can do the same things they do, can be rebellious. Only that whatever we do it comes from a more emotional place than ISTPs, perhaps the need to stand out, or just as an emotional outlet. I don't deny some of us are ""fluffy"", but I know ISFPs (not me, I'm fine) who are very dark and even their brand of hedonism is motivated by an intense need for release.

Context: I've met 2 ISFPs girls recently, the first one was throught a night with mutual friends, she was slightly younger than me but we had clicked so well that even her friends encouraged me to pursue her further, we started texting each other and it was incredible how we operated so differently but had so many things in common but then she ghosted me out of nowhere and then some weeks later when we met in person throught mutual friends again she started to try and get my attention back and said she was sorry for ignoring me and that i should get back to talk to her. Fast forward we were talking for some weeks and i thought we really had a sort of connection lol at least i did, i called her to go out with me but she made some excuses, i kept the contact and the talking was always fine i thought maybe she wanted to make a friendship first and now she is ignoring me again.

The other was the same age as me and i met her throught my work, she was kinda more agressive in her advances towards me. For a girl like her that was so quiet and timid it was almost a surreal experience. Started to tease and play with me in a very physical way and the fact it made me uncomfortable just made it even funnier to her. Again i knew something was off but being the idiot that i am and influenced by my women colleagues who were sure that she was into me i started to fall for her advances. And again the same pattern of behavior of the previous girl, she invites me to do some work activities together just to ignore me completely during it and afterwards stop replying my texts and so on. But then after some time passes she goes back to try to get my attention and be near close to me. Then she get colds again when i try to be more assertive and it keeps repeating again and again.




It's so maddening. I heard a theory from socionics that explains this dynamic and is illustrated by this history of the Heron and the Crane.

isfp,"Lately I've been stuck in some sort of existential crisis, and it seems to be triggered most often when I encounter Ti arguments. Like, people often say that you just have to do what is right and stuff, but Ti users (especially xNTPs) seem to constantly poke holes in everything, to the point where I feel like I can't trust or value anything anymore. A while ago I remember seeing an INTP talking about stuff like justice, morality and other stuff simply being human inventions and not the truth.

I've also seen a bunch of others saying stuff like ""nobody wants to be the bad guy, so they put up their own beliefs and justify their actions and thoughts with them so they don't feel bad"", and some other stuff like saying art is objective (so basically for example some music is supposedly inherently lesser than other music), and that subjective observations are irrelevant since they're all grounded in basis animal instincts. Some argue that feelings and values are all redundant and fake, and that logic is the explanation for everything and the truth.

After receiving over 1,650 responses nearly overnight, I got a ton of data to go through. This updated form will give a bit more information on some additional questions that were created from the previous form.

A few years ago I fell in love with a friend who was an ENFJ. The circumstances became very complicated and we ended up having a massive, painful misunderstanding that led to us parting ways.

For example, I‚Äôm a photographer and doing photography during events literally drains me to death. I also need some time alone to sort my thoughts out after I‚Äôve had a deep conversation with someone but this isn‚Äôt because deep conversations drain me, it‚Äôs just that I‚Äôm able to think better without Se distractions. 

However, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm someone who knows how to feel ‚Äúenough‚Äù when I‚Äôm spending time alone. It‚Äôs not like I run away from alone time. In fact, I do a lot of things on my own. I go to the park to chill on my own, I go to the mosque (I‚Äôm Muslim) and love spending hours there on my own. I can sit in my basement for hours and just think. But I have a burning desire to spend time with friends. If I‚Äôm honest, I have one friend in particular that I‚Äôm pretty attached to and I think my attachment to her is what probably makes me feel like I‚Äôm not enough when I‚Äôm on my own. We‚Äôre close friends but we don‚Äôt get to spend a lot of time together. Other than her, I also gain a lot of energy when I spend time with a group of good friends. It makes me feel so hyped and happy spending time with people I click with and I would say this is actually much more enjoyable to me than spending time on my own even if I‚Äôm doing something I enjoy. 

It just makes me sad that I can‚Äôt describe my alone time as fun. Maybe I should consciously remind myself that I‚Äôm enjoying my time when I do activities on my own. Because I don‚Äôt hate it. Maybe it just requires a bit of a mental push for it to feel like that.

I rejected my own feelings. Anyone else who saw me would've known I was innately creative and morally-driven. In my darkest times, I over-analyze everything and hyperfocus on the future- and how it could go wrong. I criticize everything. The shadow, I guess? When I saw all these people saying, ""N types are more intelligent and thoughtful,"" I thought, ""Well, aren't I smart? Don't I analyze things like crazy? I look into the future and past with dedication!! I plan everything out. I can't be a sensor."" I adopted these close-minded beliefs.

The ISFPs I've known throughout my life don't seem to have any deep moral values or any deep sense of meaning or purpose, they seem to just focus on enjoying life in the moment. For example, this ISFP I know talks a lot about meeting women and getting laid, that seems to be his main goal in life. When we do go out and meet women and talk about them afterwards, he strictly talks about their looks. He reads about pickup artistry and would love to be able to date multiple women at the same time without telling them, he's a typical jock/dudebro in that respect. This is consistent with other ISFPs I've known, another ISFP was totally fine with cheating or sleeping with another man's girlfriend, another one told me only cared about his girlfriend's looks, etc. It's possible that I only met immature ISFPs but I just can't detect their emotional or spiritual depth. The only thing I detect is a certain sensitivity/innocence that shows up occasionally, as well as a desire to take care of their friends, nothing beyond that.

Is this something you hear a lot from other types? Did I meet the wrong ISFPs? Am I not looking close enough? Do I need to look for a different kind of Fi?

Im into like journaling and capturing memories, socializing, makeup and fashion, organizing and planning my life for pretty useless reasons, i always make rules for myself that i never end up following,. so this is me: shaved my head once when i was crazy, people used to say im confusing but that ive matured alot (i still get it), i develop crushes quick quick quick, love everyone, get called too nice which i realize now that its more that im THOUGHTFUL..i buy lots of books and end up reading half of one. lazy, cant stay in school cause its hard, used to be the most insecure girl in the world, people say i talk alot and im weird and i stare at everyone in public and wave at [children.im](https://children.im/) a loser at home, but i also have a big long mind of memories and have done alot have been in lots of relationships and friendships so many groups and suspensions and funnnnnnnnnnnnnn. oh im high, also many people think i have add/adhdh. I wonder if I am an intuitive because of the stereotype being in their heads, clumsy, creative, terrible with diretions. thats so me like people alwyas call me ""scatterbrained"" and interesting and the best person for conversation, but at the same time i feel so basic and shallow and poetry. im more creative now but i just mkae it up, i cant read poetry and understand the meaning so easily. i make this wondering about my typing style and stuff, like youll know right? everyone compares me to my father and hes most lilkely enfp. oh i l approach people allll the time cause i die if i dont act on those urges:/ k thanks for your time!

ALSO, i am truly nice and open id hang out with you and your parents in this moment. like some people, i swear to god, can be so judgmental and self focused itsmindblowing, all that attitude, but i also love it at the same time cause its add more character to my life. but im fun and ppl tell me i should be an interviwer or reporter or actress or youtube star. lmfao thinking back they were all boys probably trying to get me to feel good. lmao. k thanks.

isfp,"How Does Personality Type Affect Feelings of Loneliness? 

I recently conducted some research on loneliness via a survey, and the responses I got from people blew me away. 

I knew that it was a problem, but I didn‚Äôt realize how MUCH of a problem it was until the survey blew up, got over a thousand responses overnight, and people kept messaging me asking about the results. 

As promised, I‚Äôd like to share the results of the survey for everyone to benefit from. 

Note: on this post I will be sharing the ‚ÄúPersonality Type‚Äù insights from the survey. For the non-personality type insights, read my post in another sub [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeNewFriendsHere/comments/eesy16/results_from_the_survey_about_loneliness_for_a/). 

The goal with the survey was to use the data to determine how big of a problem loneliness really is, and then eventually create a program that aims to ‚Äúcure‚Äù loneliness. 

By ‚Äúcure,‚Äù I mean take someone that struggles with loneliness at 7/10 or higher and bring that down to 3/10 or lower by improving their situation or mental state. 

The survey was quite barebones, but that was intentional. It ended up giving a ton more data than I could‚Äôve predicted. 

Here are the fascinating ‚ÄúPersonality Type vs. Loneliness‚Äù insights uncovered, thanks to all of your help: 

‚ÄúDoes Personality Type affect susceptibility to high feelings of loneliness?‚Äù Yes, it does. 

Why that is, I‚Äôm not exactly sure‚Ä¶ So let me share with you the data, and together we can talk about it. 

The LEAST LONELY personality type on average is the ESTJ, with average feelings of loneliness reported at 4.86/10. 

The MOST LONELY personality type on average is the INFP, with average feelings of loneliness reported at 6.9/10. 

Note that the ESTJ &amp; INFP do not share any similar letters- and each letter compared with each other had consistently different levels of loneliness. 

E‚Äôs average feelings of loneliness is 5.54, whereas I‚Äôs have 6.26. 

S‚Äôs average feelings of loneliness is 5.49, whereas N‚Äôs have 6.27. 
T‚Äôs average feelings of loneliness is 5.74, whereas F‚Äôs have 6.12. 

J‚Äôs average feelings of loneliness is 5.87, whereas P‚Äôs have 6.01. 

This trend held true between all other personality types. For example, the INFJ was the second most lonely personality type, at 6.8 average feelings of loneliness. 

The more INFP letters you have, the more likely you are to feel lonely, and vice versa for the ESTJ letters. 

The top three least lonely personality types are ESTJ (4.86), ESFJ (5), and ESTP (5). 

The top three most lonely personality types are INFP (6.9), INFJ (6.8), and ENFJ (6.54). 

That is all for personality type- for all other insights about this project, review the full report [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeNewFriendsHere/comments/eesy16/results_from_the_survey_about_loneliness_for_a/).

&amp;#x200B;

* How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.

21 years old. Male. I'm very quiet, but I tend to be very playful and naughty, a little impulsive, and I also love to tease others as a way of showing affection, I can also be extremely loyal and very naive to trusted people, which for me is an imminent problem.

I can be very paranoid about close people, I can distrust their trust, if they really care about me, if they want to use me, and so on. and because of this whole process I end up distancing myself from others from time to time to invest in my dearest autonomy.

I am also a little fickle, if something stops looking new or interesting automatically I get bored and go after something better. because of this I always end up looking for instant pleasures

* Is there a medical diagnosis that impact your mental/comportamental stability somehow?

Some people have already told me that I may have ADHD, but for now I have nothing diagnosed.

* Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?

I didn't have a rigid upbringing. My mother always attended the Christian church and even took me to church when I was younger. but it was never something she made me do, so much so that one day I just stopped attending church and she said nothing much. ok, she tried to get me back, had some fights, but honestly there was nothing exaggerated.

Like every mother she always tried to impose orders like ""clean your room"", ""do the dishes"" and so on, but a lot of those things I just didn't do for being a lazy motherfucker, so she fought me, and it was just that.

* What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?

I'm currently a stockist just as a temporary job. I do not like and also do not dislike, honestly is much better than being unemployed.

* If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?

refreshed for sure.

* What is your relation with movement and your surroundings? For instance do you prefer a sport or outdoors event? If an outdoors event what is it? And why? If not what type of activities do you tend to engage i?

I love moving my body and I am very interested in activities related to it. I even usually dance alone in my room and stuff, but nonetheless I don't have a very good motor coordination, stamina to perform these activities and i'm kinda lazy, so most of the time I stay inactive in my room.

Regarding the environment I think I even have a good perception of it, I am almost always one of the first to notice a change in it.

* How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?

I'm very curious but I don't usually be ""the ideas guy"". From time to time something usually catches my eye, so I look for and consume as much information as I can find on the internet until I get some ""mastery"" on that subject. of course with no intention other than learning about that subject.

* Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?

I run away from leadership positions. I used to be the lone wolf in the groups, so you can imagine I'm the type that ""I make mine and you make yours"". I'm not the best person to be giving orders and honestly I don't even want to be because i always end up being pretty soft/ indifferent or tyrant.

* Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?

I have the motor coordination of a door. I get the feeling that every time I try to control my body it seems like I'm trying to control a giant robot or even trying to hold the tip of a broom in one hand while trying to balance a bucket of water over my head. but despite of that I even like to use my hands and my body as it energizes me in an unparalleled way.

* Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.

I even play the guitar and I have a certain ease with music and its instruments but I don't consider myself artistic at all.

every once in a while I write some songs but it sucks SO MUCH that I give up finishing it.

* What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?

**Past** \- I think a lot about the past: the good things, the bad things, the things I miss, what I should do differently and so on. I think I think more of the past when I'm in a negative state.

**Present** \- Living in the present seems to be my natural state. I almost always try to fill my time with something that is stimulating and exciting because I usually get bored very easily.

**Future** \- I don't think much about the future, and when I think about it, it's only a glance. when I get excited about a future situation I usually have flashes of that situation, it always happens naturally to me. But apart from that, I don't usually think consciously about the future, I don't plan or do anything, I just follow the flow.

isfp," I believe myself to be an ISFJ.  I'm 14, not sure if you can be typed this young?  Here is some information about me:

* I   often find myself downtrodden and depressed over what is currently   going on in my life. When I return home from school, I will start   thinking about cringeworthy/bad things that happened during my day and   fretting over them. I often try to reassure myself that things will not   always be the way they are today... that they can, and hopefully will,   get better.
* I have a lot of trouble truly *living in the moment.*    I was very good at it when I was little, but I spend most of my time   in my head.  I usually think too much about the past, or too much about   the future.  Both stress me out - when I'm thinking about the past,  I'm  either thinking about something that once was and isn't anymore, or  I'm  thinking too much about the future.  Now, sometimes when I think  about  the future, I envision something great - I think of all the  discoveries  that may come to humankind, about what the world might be  like in  2040... but at other points, I'm simply afraid.  I love and  hate  thinking about the unknown.  I fear that I'll end up without a  job.  I  fear that things will not be as I'd like them to be.  I fear  that I  cannot plan out every single thing... I fear this, and yet I  love it.
* I   have a tough time adapting to new situations.  I hated the change to   middle school.  I hated going from pre-school to kindergarten.  My first   few days of high school were rough.  I hate having to handle a bunch  of  new people all at once... it gives me anxiety.
* I   always feel like I'm on my way to some kind of great eventual   discovery.  I feel like there's something I'm missing in life right now,   an ultimate truth that I'll have to come to myself.
* I am great at memorizing lists and things of sort if necessary.
* I   have a hard time visualizing shapes - for example, in Geometry, I'm   having a difficult time with rotations and reflections because I simply   cannot envision it in the way that some of my peers can.  This is why I   prefer Algebra.
* I   feel that my main goal in life is to learn as much as I can about the   world around me.  I want to make a great discovery.  I want to be   remembered for something, anything, before I die.
* I always like having a plan.  I hate improvising and going into things unprepared.
* I   do not pay a lot of attention to my physical appearance, though I   believe that I should.  I haven't been brought up to care as much in the   way that some people have - I honestly just wear what I find   comfortable.  I never feel a need to dress up.  I can easily pick out   flaws in my physical appearance, but I don't actually spend a lot of   time working toward any improvements.
* I'm never 100% comfortable, unless I am asleep.  I can come *off* as a calm, but my mind is often floating with negative possibilities when I have time to sit down and think about things.
* I   am incredibly sensitive.  I can sometimes bottle up my feelings for a   few days, but I'll eventually break out crying when I'm alone.  I don't   like discussing my feelings with other people.  It embarrasses me,  even  though I'm comfortable with others venting to me.",1576970269

isfp,"*  How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself. 

21. Male. I'm very quiet, but nonetheless I look a lot like a dog or even a child with people I have some appreciation for or things that interest me. I tend to be very playful and naughty, a little impulsive, and I also love to tease others as a way of showing affection, I can also be extremely loyal and very naive to trusted people, which for me is an imminent problem.

I can be very paranoid about close people, I can distrust their trust, if they really care about me, if they want to use me, and so on. and because of this whole process I end up distancing myself from others from time to time to invest in my dearest autonomy.

I am also a little fickle, if something stops looking new or interesting automatically I get bored and go after something better. because of this I always end up looking for instant pleasures

&amp;#x200B;

*  Is there a medical diagnosis that impact your mental/comportamental stability somehow? 

 Some people have already told me that I may have ADHD, but for now I have nothing diagnosed.

*  Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it? 

 I didn't have a rigid upbringing. My mother always attended the Christian church and even took me to church when I was younger. but it was never something she made me do, so much so that one day I just stopped attending church and she said nothing much. ok, she tried to get me back, had some fights, but honestly there was nothing exaggerated.

Like every mother she always tried to impose orders like ""clean your room"", ""do the dishes"" and so on, but a lot of those things I just didn't do for being a lazy motherfucker, so she fought me, and it was just that.

&amp;#x200B;

*  What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not? 

 I'm currently a stockist just as a temporary job. I do not like and also do not dislike, honestly is much better than being unemployed.

&amp;#x200B;

*  If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed? 

 refreshed for sure.

&amp;#x200B;

*  What is your relation with movement and your surroundings? For instance do you prefer a sport or outdoors event? If an outdoors event what is it? And why? If not what type of activities do you tend to engage i? 

 I love moving my body and I am very interested in activities related to it. I even usually dance alone in my room and stuff, but nonetheless I don't have a very good motor coordination, stamina to perform these activities and i'm kinda lazy, so most of the time I stay inactive in my room.

Regarding the environment I think I even have a good perception of it, I am almost always one of the first to notice a change in it.

&amp;#x200B;

*  How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate? 

 I'm very curious but I don't usually be ""the ideas guy"". From time to time something usually catches my eye, so I look for and consume as much information as I can find on the internet until I get some ""mastery"" on that subject. of course with no intention other than learning about that subject.

&amp;#x200B;

*  Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be? 

 I run away from leadership positions. I used to be the lone wolf in the groups, so you can imagine I'm the type that ""I make mine and you make yours"". I'm not the best person to be giving orders and honestly I don't even want to be because i always end up being pretty soft and indifferent or tyrant and adamant.

&amp;#x200B;

*  Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity? 

 I have the motor coordination of a door. I get the feeling that every time I try to control my body it seems like I'm trying to control a giant robot or even trying to hold the tip of a broom in one hand while trying to balance a bucket of water over my head. but despite of that I even like to use my hands and my body as it energizes me in an unparalleled way.

&amp;#x200B;

*  Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer. 

 I even play the guitar and I have a certain ease with music and its instruments but I don't consider myself artistic at all.

On the surface, he's a great guy. He's easy to get along with, friendly, sociable, and extremely hard working.




He also seems to enjoy making other people happy. He's always telling jokes, and has this very innocent, goofy, sense of humor.




As I started paying more attention though, I began to wonder if this is just a facade to cover a lot of inner turmoil.




He comes off as far more serious when he's by himself, and sometimes just avoids everyone, and doesn't talk at all. He has also made offhand comments such a saying that he doesn't have any real life friends, and that ""Laughter is a good way to forget how angry I feel inside.""




There are also these very brief moments of anger that will flash across his face. Such as on some days someone will ask him to do something, and he will have a brief look of just disgust, and hate, before immediately burying it under his ""nice guy"" personality.




He has even straight up said to me before when I asked him if he was upset that he does not get mad.

And then here's the really weird one - he'll say he has a stomach ache, and then a few minutes later says he just thought he had a stomach ache but really didn't, or the same for a few other things.

isfp,"Been together for 6 months, I'm 24, he is 22. INFP bf and I are long distance. He is in another country. We get along GREAT with everything.. except the dilemma of video chatting and a little communication. I don't really like being on my phone all day, while he waits on Whatsapp all day to see if I message him. He just ended his old job about a week ago and so he has been wanting to video chat everyday and he wants to do it for an hour+. I have video chatted with him almost everyday, but I cut it short because I want to or I need to go do something else. Some days I just don't feel like talking. Messaging is enough for me. I feel like we have more to talk about if we're not constantly talking all day. Same with voice calls-- I'm perfectly good with 15 min, 30 min max and then getting on with my day. Also, we tell eachother what we do through message usually, and on video call we tend to ask eachother the same questions again... I don't really like that. Like there isn't much to talk about in that moment because we already discussed everything.. if that makes sense? Again, it would be better to talk sparingly throughout the day IMO, rather than constantly all day. 

But he needs long calls. He says he is trying to connect with me more by video chatting and to him it seems like I am not putting in effort regarding video calls.. I really think the 15-30 mins is enough. But not to him. .. In my past relationships, I spent a lot of time by myself, and I would come to my exes for quality time much like a cat would. Then after quality time I would go by myself again. My boyfriend is more like a dog and always wants to see me. Which is good yes... but it's starting to push me away a little bit. I feel like the relationship was at it's best when he was busy working, and I was busy with school, and we would wait until the end of our busy days to talk. 

Sometimes during our arguments I shut down and ignore my phone. I ignore all calls and messages, and I go outside to de-stress. He will call and call and message, practically having a damn near mental breakdown. A lot of the time I just ignore it and continue on focusing on myself to become calm/content again. I have talked to my mother about this, who is a real tough ESTJ, and she thinks I am handling it right. She also agrees with me it is better to stay busy and communicate at the end of the day, and that 15-30 minute phone/video calls are enough. (She is from a time where cell phones and instant gratification didn't exist.) 

So we just had an argument earlier today over video calling. He asked me if we could do it later and I said ""yeah maybe, we'll see"" and he got real upset.. I don't want to say ""yes"" and then not be able to cause I left my phone in my room and I was busy with something else. He has already chewed me out for making ""false promises"" (even though I don't promise anything) in regards to video call. I explained to him why I said maybe, but he pushed his point and ended up making me upset.. Anyway, my whole point is I don't think this should be that big of an issue, and I am not sure how to resolve this with him. We are meeting in person in 1 MONTH. He is staying with me for 2 weeks. I am pretty hyped, I think he is too, but we're arguing so much all of a sudden. Just about damn video calling. To me it's so stupid and meaningless. It's not worth arguing over.

isfp,"Bit of a long title, sorry about that.  Anyway, I've seen a lot of posts talking about how Fi doms are horrible at conflict, and I'm not. At least I don't think I am. My problem with conflict is that no one I get into an argument with responds in a healthy manner. No one wants to reach a point of agreement, or even agree to disagree. 

&amp;#x200B;

Every time I've had an argument with a \*friend\* suddenly we aren't friends anymore, and it's not because of me, it's because of them. 

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is everyone I've ever stepped into conflict with comes in two types.

&amp;#x200B;

A. People who take it like a competition. I had an unhealthy ENFP friend, who he would get so stubborn in any argument, and start dishing out personal attacks, against my character. Since his stubbornness wore me down he won a lot of arguments simply because I'd run out of energy, and just walk away.

&amp;#x200B;

B. People who take the conflict way too personally. I've had a lot of \*friends\* who after we have a fight, suddenly they'll start talking less, and less to me. Until one day they just stop talking entirely. 

&amp;#x200B;

I try to avoid silly fights, and I don't mind arguing, and I usually don't take it personally. I've just gotten to a point where I feel like it's everyone else who responds negatively because they either want to win really bad, or they take it personally. It's really bad when it's both.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel really lost for example against XSTJ in an argument, because when upset they have relentless stamina, and it becomes really clear that they seem to take being disagreed with as some kind of personal attack.

isfp,"Hello everyone,

I'm a student who is on an exchange program and while I was on it I met an ISFP girl who pretty much caught my attention since the first second I saw her. After a few hours of being around her and talking to her I knew I liked her a lot and had to ask her out. Anyway, we saw each other a few times and I really fell for her. But what I didn't know is that she had a boyfriend she never told me about. I was pretty pissed about it but I kept on flirting (maybe because I was pissed, Idk). Either way, she later explained to me (since I opened up to her) that her feelings take time to come and that she wouldn't want anything romantic during this time because when we left it would end in tears, and that she really didn't feel anything for me romantically, also that she would never cheat on her bf, etc. 

I understood that she was loyal to her bf both emotionally and physically, so I didn't want to disrespect her by keeping on flirting like a fuckboy, specially because I'm not one. Either way, I feel like that's the impression that I've left on her. I like to move pretty fast when it comes to romance, specially because the time was tight, and I might have sounded a bit like the typical fuckboy.

Even though I still like her a lot I'm going to move on, since I don't have much time left here anyway. We still have a plan to go somewhere together (not sure if someone else is coming, but I think not for now) but I pretty much realized that she would never fall for me this fast, specially when she recently has a bf. But I guess that she still likes being with me, since we're going to this place together. Maybe I'm getting friendzoned but I don't care at this point.

**My question here though is:** I know that she has a boyfriend now and I'm not planning to get in the middle of that. But both of us are pretty young (early 20s) and I really liked her, so should I keep in touch with her after this ends? I'm going to enjoy my time as a single fella to go out with other girls and explore what's around, but still, should I have any hopes on this becoming something else if I'm there talking to her and maybe supporting here even when we're far? I honestly dgaf about distance, if something happened between us I would have caught a plane to her country as soon as I could without thinking twice either way. So I guess I need the insight of my ISFP half-siblings (it's yo boy ESFP here) to help me out with this one ;D

isfp,"This is something that always keeps me thinking for a while.

Like (this is going to be blown out of proportions, but eh), imagine the following:

You (the IxFP) are the main character in a fantasy story. You're the typical guy/girl with a sword and a shield, you come from a small poor town and you're the chosen one who has to defeat a demon (the ExTP) in order to destroy the poverty from the town and the evil from your world, etc. So you embark on a journey, experience a lot of things, etc, and at long last, you're in front of the demon you're sworn to slay! So, you fight and eventually you defeat it, but before dying it still talks to you for a bit. 

And this is where it gets painful, because he's suddenly dropping his joking mannerisms and having a serious conversation with you. With a serious look he asks you something in the effect of ""is what you're fighting for really *right*?"". ""In a way, you're much more evil than me. You're a total moralistic hypocrite. That iron sword you're carrying? It was made by young children in third world countries who had to work on it under dire circumstances, causing many of them to die in the process. Those villagers you cherish so much? They've committed many sins themselves. But you love them you say, and they love you? You're wrong. You only love them because they've aided you, been nice to you. But that was a front, too. All they've done is build you into their little problem solving machine by making you believe they care about you. You blame me for everything, but in the end you've done at least as many evil deeds as me. Throughout your journey you've killed, killed and killed, and as a response to my deeds, you've done the same as I. Kill. And why *do* you hate me in the first place? Because I spread evil and kill. And now you've done the same as me. You're the very thing you swore to destroy. Everything and everyone you've believed in until now is basically just trash with a pretty disguise on. But you're probably going to wave away all what I just said, believing me to be just another evil guy with evil ideas and evil words. You're afraid of the truth. All of you people are like that. Well, obviously I'm about to die so... enjoy your happy jolly illusion while it lasts, fool.""

..so, after all that, he grins once more at you and dies. You leave the place, and you're... actually the one who got defeated. Psychologically, at least. You basically sink into a deep spiral of self-doubt after that, and you're not quite the same you were anymore.

(The story might be a bit rough, but I hope this gets the point across that I'm trying to make)

This is the sort of stuff that always gets me, definitely one of the most disturbing problems I can imagine. What are we supposed to do in situations like these? It seems like this only really happens to IxFPs, TJs for example seem to be rather immune to this (INTJs would probably just wave this sort of stuff away and disregard is as irrelevant mutterings of a sore loser, but there's always a small part of me which is afraid for the scenario wherein the ExTP is actually right and the INTJ (and us, by extension) are basically the ignorant ones who're afraid of the truth, so we just act like it doesn't affect us because otherwise we'd lose completely). It's like some sort of logical counterpoint against everything we as Fi users believe in, and since their arguments typically have a lot of thought into them, they're correct, in a way. But to what extent? As Fi doms we're also typically rather weak with our reasoning skills, so we have trouble asserting our viewpoints in a logical manner. Basically, this mindfucks us completely (or at least me). The possibility that they *might* be right is extremely scary. But they could also just be messing with us. You just can't know.

When I was younger it would make me feel so ashamed, like I‚Äôm incapable of true happiness and I don‚Äôt appreciate the people in my life. 

Whenever I‚Äôm in a long-term relationship, that person starts to gradually annoy me until I become this shitty-resentment-guy who has to remind myself every day that I should be grateful for everything I have and stop ‚Äúmoving the goalposts‚Äù when it comes to the standards I have for my partner.

And then they go on to list all the reasons I should be thankful for them, and how nobody is perfect, and they don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm perfect so who do I think I am to be so judgmental...

And the worst is when they rationalize their shitty behavior by saying, ‚ÄúYeah, and I stopped smoking, you‚Äôd still find something ELSE to bitch about!‚Äù

And what can I say?? Would I? Probably, yeah. Because I can think of ten other things off the top of my head, that I‚Äôve grown to hate about them during our time together.

isfp,"I‚Äôve been seeing a meme going around that triggers mixed feelings in me. It looks like one of those inspirational platitude quote-things that ESFPs litter their pages with, except the quote itself seems xNTJ in nature.

It says something to the effect of: ‚ÄúI wanna be with someone emotionally mature enough not to project the trauma of their past relationships onto me‚Äù or some shit.

On one hand, I‚Äôm ISFP and celebrate uniqueness among individuals. People who are both real and reactionary (dominant Fi authenticity + auxiliary Se reactions = ISFP) can‚Äôt be ‚Äúboxed in‚Äù, are unpredictable, and can‚Äôt accurately be assigned to a label. 

And I think every ISFP reading this has experienced the annoyance of being prematurely judged (by someone socially presumptuous) based on that person‚Äôs past experiences with a volatile ESFP, or a calculating ISTP, rigid ISFJ, clingy INFP, or whatever type they think you resemble at that moment because we ISFPs are adaptable, spontaneous, social chameleons.

It sucks to be judged anyway, but especially for something you‚Äôre NOT. And when someone does that to me, I often don‚Äôt even bother trying to change their mind bc fuck them. They don‚Äôt recognize my value and aren‚Äôt worth my time.

BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, constantly ignoring my (incredibly accurate) intuition about people has led me to make terrible decisions and regret not ‚Äúlistening to my gut‚Äù. I wind up in shitty situations with shitty people and I can tell that outsiders wonder how I ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt see this coming‚Äù or ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt spot the red flags.‚Äù

But the truth is, I did. Every time. Often before anyone else ever would have. I size people up within moments of meeting them and I‚Äôm never, ever surprised by what transpires after that. Disappointed? Yes. Surprised? No.

And yet I do not trust my Ni. I‚Äôm slowly starting to, as I get older. Because I feel stupid investing my time and energy into someone who ends up being the EXACT type I identified them as within five seconds of meeting them...yet I proceeded to ‚Äúgive a chance‚Äù bc ‚Äúmaybe this will be the one who surprises me....‚Äù

But they never do. They‚Äôre always predictable and disappointing and I get mad at myself for being perpetually optimistic and giving it a shot anyway.

It sucks that my most reliable function in this regard is my undeveloped ‚Äúchild-like‚Äù tertiary Ni that acts up in other ways (paranoia, suspicion, etc.)

So how do you avoid ‚Äúblack and white‚Äù thinking and walk that fine line between recognizing obvious behavioral patterns among people while still seeing the potential of each individual to be different than the others/more compatible with you?

It seems like you either have to be smart and selective (see: dismissive, potentially miss opportunities for deep connection like xNTJs do) or a dumbass optimist who jumps in head first and ‚Äúwings it‚Äù until everything inevitable explodes in your face (see:ExFPs) and leaves you feeling stupid for ever proceeding in the first place, despite your better judgment...???

Despite graduating with a high GPA, attending a 4 year degree after high school made me beyond miserable; having my head stuffed into books 24/7 rather than hands-on activities, and being surrounded by people always talking about detailed planning for the future (like those applying for PhD/med school/law school) was my personal version of hell. I can‚Äôt plan more than 5 minutes in advance tbh and have no clue how 18 year old ISFP is supposed to plan your entire life with majors/academic tracks.

If I could go back in time and do life again, I‚Äôd go to a trade school (plumber, HVAC, mechanic) or jump into working full time doing something hands on/arts oriented.

isfp,"Hey there,

I'm not sure wether this should be posted here or not, but I feel like I'll get better advice here than anywhere else, so I'll just do it here.

**So, for context:** So I've been talking/sometimes meeting up with an ISFP girl and I don't know wether she has feelings for me or not.. And I also don't know how to deal with the situation.

To start with I should say that I'm currently in a relationship. But it's a relationship that has made me very unhappy and that is hanging by a string. I wish I broke up before I met this girl but you don't get to pick when things like these happen. I've never told her about my girlfriend because I knew it would ruin things, but she knows that I have one. Also I don't know if she has a boyfriend and I'm not sure wether I should ask or not. The only sign I've ever heard of her having one was a joke I overheard, but she seemed pretty upset about it.

**The actual thing:** Sometimes I think that she doesn't have interest in me , but maybe that's just my perception of things. Like the fact that sometimes she comes online and doesn't reply to my messages. Or the fact that she doesn't seem as eager as me to meet up. But once again I'm an extrovert and I just want stuff to happen as quickly as possible to avoid being stuck in my own thoughts and feelings, so yeah, maybe I'm just going a bit crazy. Plus, I know that the fact that I'm still in a relationship is not helping me out. I know that I should take this slowly, but I can't avoid rushing things like these, since overthinking them makes me overthink them and I go a bit crazy. 

On the other hand, some stuff happens that makes me think otherwise. Sometimes she starts texting me and keeps the conversation going. We're playful and when I tease her she teases me back (nothing too NSFW). When we're together we're generally having a good time and always talking (sometimes deeper stuff, sometimes joking). Plus, she seems interested in meeting me again, alone.

Another thing that happened was that I went out a few nights ago with a group (inc. her). I like to fool around with people and joke a lot, and in that day she did the same to me. I even danced with some other girls in a club (just casually) and eventually she told me to go back to my ''chick'' lol. Also, sometime later she sent me a text apologizing for joking with me like that, but I didn't even get upset about it tbh.

Anyway, by now most of you either think that I'm an asshole or you're wondering why I don't chill the fuck out and wait for things to happen. Well, that's because neither of us are in our city right now and I feel like I don't have enough time to make it happen. So whenever I'm alone I find myself thinking of it, and honestly I hate it, but my brain makes me do it.

So I just need some advice on what to do.. I know that I have to break up my current relationship first. I should have done that long ago. Wether this will work or not I can't be unhappy and drag someone with me along just because, things need to move on. But asides from that, wtf should I do?

Should I wait up until I meet her again and ask her if she has an SO or should I just I ask her by text before I meet her? Should I not ask at all? Should I tell her when I breakup with my SO or should I not? Should I be worried she ignores my texts sometimes? Should I ask her what are we, really? And, I mean... Do I even have a chance? I have so many questions, I can't even list them all, I was hoping you could help me. Another thing that's in my mind is that she probably knows it won't work because of distance. My feelings about this have always been different, I feel like if we want it, we do it, no second thoughts.

When it comes to conflict, I am often able to quickly think of holes that I can poke in my opponent's logic. The problem is I don't feel like escalating the fight and so I just back down.

I'm actually able to be quite articulate as long as the person in conflict with me is keeping a cool head and not going off on me.

It's like a few weeks ago not my boss, but a supervisor sort of yelled at me. I thought of three things I could have said that would not only be a rebuttal of what she said, but also prove her wrong, and instead I was just like okay yeah you're right.

Whenever my step dad goes off on me, there are plenty of things that I can think of saying back that would be completely logical for me to say, but he just has so much anger when he's going off on me that I just decide to keep quiet.

I remember one time he got mad at me because he decided to do something on his own and I was not home to pitch in and help out with it in the first thing I thought of saying to him was;

""You need to back off. You chose to do this project on your own, without informing anyone that you were planning to do it. if I had known, as in you had told me ahead of time that you were planning to do this yeah I would have stayed home and helped out. it is not my fault that you chose to act on your own without telling anyone about it.""

I've felt this way about society as long as I've been aware of the world outside myself (kindergarten) but really didn't have the mental capacity, emotional fortitude or overall clarity to evaluate or understand it until  later in life. Since I've come aware of MBTI more in depth with the cognitive functions. I've since wondered if maybe my thoughts and feelings are also shared with other ISFPs. 

As a disclaimer: I've tested as INTP, ISFP, INFP, INTJ, INFJ. Me being obsessive about understanding in general and especially myself I've come to be mostly convinced that I'm ISFP with highly developed Ti (3rd most developed in my stack.) Mostly due to my relationship with art and how I use it to communicate and express myself honestly with the world. 

To set the stage so to speak: currently it's a cold cloudy day in CO. Listening to Murs-First Love, in my Pjs and sipping some coffee. Waiting to get called to work.

Well now that little background info is out of the way on to the actual point of this post. Being someone that is genuine, honest to a fault but with walls of stoicism in a society that is seemingly prominently superficial and stifling. Someone that sees meaning in even the smallest of gestures. Acknowledging the masks we wear and the mechanisms we use to escape our internal demons. Seeing beauty and growth in the darkness within ourselves. Most oblivious to this or too busy chasing the carrot in the rat race of society. Some of us putting our all into what we enjoy while society and the mainstream mostly favors mass produced soulless objects (quantity over quality so to speak.) Someone that listens to understand rather than to respond. Always finding myself in the gray (both mentally and emotionally) where as to others life is seemingly so white and black. Seeing and visualizing the cause and effects of decisions making me mostly slow but deliberate. In the play of life (""All the world's a stage"" reference) this makes me feel as if I'm in third person watching the world go by. An observer not wanting to influence but purely ""being the change I wish to see in the world."" While simultaneously grateful for and appreciative of the uniqueness of us all. Learning from the past, living in and appreciating the present for what it is and hopeful for the future though unknown.

This is turning more into a subjective tangent ""about me"" than I had liked so I'll wrap it up here. I hope this doesn't come off as condescending as I tend to think of myself as a modest person and expounding myself to people I haven't acclimated myself to makes me uneasy. I'm a loner and these things have been building up for quite some time. Enough so to actually voice them in a direct way and not indirectly purely through my art and music taste. Maybe it's purely what to expect with Fi, Ne, Ti. I'll leave you with some quotes that may give insight. 

""Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail."" -Ralph Waldo Emerson

""Peace cannot be kept by force; it can only be achieved by understanding.‚Äù -Einstein

Fifteen minutes later, I got a phone call from the little town near Bakersfield where he actually lives, which has a population of 15,000.

He hung up after about ten seconds.

I did a reverse phone lookup. It‚Äôs not a spoofed area code, and not a business. (And there are internet stalking laws, so that‚Äôs where I stopped.)

1.) Do you follow people that you know, without telling them?

2.). Why would you call someone and then say nothing?

isfp,"Hi everyone,

Curious to see how many can relate.

I've developed a sort of awareness and bitterness about the ugliness of the world.

As a result, I don't believe any more that hard-work will lead me anywhere. I don't really care any more about giving well-wishes, because I don't have any for myself, on birthdays, new years, etc. I don't really care any more about offering gifts because I know they're mostly a waste of space in already too busy households. As I don't want to consume too much, nor give credit to powerful corporations, I don't care too much about the fancy societal clothing, I don't indulge at all in alcohol parties, and I try to go to fast-food as scarcely as I can.

Actually, I do find my peace in my introverted activities, and I am not at all an all-people pleaser. They exhaust me with their shallow shenanigans.

As a result I end up as the asshole when I don't dress ""properly"" for work (manager position, need to put on some fancy shirt), when I don't offer a gift to my mother (but on the other hand I need to help her sustain her lifestyle, so having her ranting about gifts is fucked up imo), when I don't bother to go the extra mile to attend a boring party, which takes too much of my time and money, etc etc.

I wish I can surround myself with like-minded people but it's nearly impossible at the time being. I don't think I would achieve the peace of mind I desire right now, since so many people expect me to change ""for the better"", so I can get ""out of my shell"", and ""be normal for once"".",1573028048
isfp,"Hi! I‚Äôve come across an ISFP M and have a crush. It‚Äôs a serious one though as in since talking to him he‚Äôs slowed me down and I‚Äôm somehow only focusing on him.

1. How do you want to be approached? (I‚Äôve read multiple things, from making sure we give you your space to continuously trying to give effort to get to know you).

2. What are your dealbreakers?

I am an entp who broke up with my isfp boyfriend about a year ago, but i really felt like we were really compatible down to the detailes. 
I'm a female but i hate doing housework and practical things. I like going out and working, looking into the future, stuff like that. He was like a puzzle piece in life cuz he liked doing household chores, cleaning, doing laundary, everything i hated. But we connected where we both had like artistic souls (?) So like movies, music, being adventurous, making memories, being authentic was all sooo fun. I have commitment issues but i rly wanted to marry him lol.
We ended up having to do long distance though, so he broke up with me just after 4 months of seperating because we were in different countries and neither of us wanted to move to where each other were. We dated last semester of college so in a way we both knew our relationship had an end. Just neither of us plan, so we drifted to our own ways. 
When we broke up, i didnt want to lose him even as a human so i asked to be friends. We kept in touch once a month or so, but fast forward a year, i ended up moving to the same country as him unexpectedly. 
We still talk once a while, we met up even. First time was good, and when we seperated he said lets do this again. Second time, well i was stressed cuz i had an interview that day, and also... well the whole world was telling me not to date him, so i was holding back a bit. Idk if he felt that or not, but that day he didnt talk about meeting again.  

I suck at deciphering emotion when it comes to romantic stuff involving me, but i still think about him and i cant tell if he still has feelings for me. 

Do you guys get over people easily? 
Do you think theres a chance if i asked him again? 

He.. has gotten a girlfriend recently, but for some reason he texted me to tell me this fact, but then later told me that he doesnt think itll last... im so confused please help T.T",1572891607

isfp,"So this ISFP girl whom I was initially only acquaintances with, rebounded onto me after a really bad breakup. Within a week or two we became super close and romantic. However, after another week or two she said that she's lost feelings and only sees me as her best friend now. We have stopped being lovey dovey since then. 

The thing is, we are still very very close emotionally (I'm the only person in her life she has this level of intimacy with - I am that one ""super duper close friend"" to her whom I see so many of you talking about) and we are even still friends with benefits. She is just adamant that she has lost romantic feelings for me, and that she can't get those feelings back, no matter how hurt I am.

I am thus quite confused and am hoping for some perspective here. For instance, is this something you could see yourself doing, and/or can you see where she is coming from? A huge part of me is really hoping that if I continue to be her best and closest friend, she'll ""find"" romantic feelings for me again somewhere down the line.

isfp,"Ok, I have a serious crush on this ISFP girl in my college. I'm almost sure that she likes me back as well. I wish to talk to her and just confess my feelings towards her, clear things up, make it serious etc. but I'm afraid that I'll screw up bad (because of aspirational Ne?). Our interactions are limited to staring at each other and the only real interaction we had was when she wanted to borrow my calculator.  The only bit of confidence that I have is from the idea that ISFJs and ISFPs are supposed to have great compatibility. 

I'd like to know what you would expect, personally, from a love confession. More specifically,

1)  Would it make her uncomfortable if I give a lot of compliments (I think most of them are actually genuine) and in general, just idolise her a lot? 

2)  Would it be awkward and way too direct if I just approach her directly and talk to her, or is it better if I slowly become friends with her and then talk about it?

3) Would talking too much about my own feelings and experiences bore her, because according to some sources, Fi users aren't as interested in listening to other's feelings as they are in sharing their own. 

I know this post reeks of low self-esteem and insecurity and I should probably work on that too.

isfp,"I have not talked to her about this yet, because I am very reserved and don‚Äôt like telling people what to do, but I‚Äôm getting a bit concerned, so I would like to get from other ISFPs some perspective here.

My friend met this guy a few months ago and they have been dating. They seem to get along just fine, but I think that is only due to my friend‚Äôs passive, understanding behavior and her hatred of conflict. This guy however has shown signs that he is not very stable or nice. For example, he has a problem with her being on Instagram and I‚Äôve seen him harshly criticize her for posting a picture or a story (she loves taking photographs of nature etc. and loves posting on Instagram). He constantly asks her if any guys reply to her messages and this has caused many arguments between them. He has a problem with her speaking with male friends. Some people might think is type of jealousy is cute or normal but personally I do not. I have seen them argue and he is very assertive, aggressive and rude, while she is mostly sweet, quiet and understanding. I hate watching that. 

He has wrongly accused her more than once of looking at other men which have caused two really bad fights between them. She felt very offended by that but forgave him very quickly, because she is so understanding always. She makes so many compromises. Last week she left her phone on her bed and he went through her DMs on Instagram and found that some random guy replied to her story one month after they started dating, and then confronted her about it because apparently she had lied and told him no guys had messaged her since they had begun dating. Then he decided she was a liar and made a hugely pathetic drama.

She really likes this guy but I am worried that she is going to feel trapped eventually. If he asks her to do something (stop following this guy, don‚Äôt talk to that guy, why are you posting so much on instagram, whose attention do you want?) she gets a little upset but then concedes. She hates conflict and wants to adapt as much as she can to keep this dude in her life.

See he lied about something, and eventually he confessed to it, and it wasn't anything big, at least not to me, but the thing is it was really big to him. He seems honestly baffled by the fact that I'm not upset about it. I mean he gave his reasoning, and I understood why he did what he did, and it's over, and done with. 

&amp;#x200B;

The lie was about his identity. I met him while he was doing a persona, and after some time he broke down, said he was sorry for it, and gave some pretty strong reasons, for why he RP'd as a crafted persona, rather than himself.

&amp;#x200B;

I think on some level he wanted me to be angry. I think it's almost like he wanted me to be pissed off, but forgive him, and since my reaction was more like; ""Oh? Okay, yeah it's cool man."" He seems to think I'm lying to him. He'll sometimes just randomly ask me if I hate him, or if I'm upset at him. I keep assuring him that I'm not, and he's like; ""but I lied to you.""  


There's a lot of worrying, and projection he's started doing.   


Some days we're fine, and then it's like he'll just randomly start bringing things up like; ""I don't think we should be friends anymore, because I lied to you.""  


We were set to RP, and every time we almost get an RP up he suddenly drops it, because he hates roleplaying as himself. As his persona he feels more confident, but since he came clean to me about who he really is, it's like he feels ashamed, and embarrassed to RP any of his ideas.   


Which in turn makes me feel bad, because I feel like all I'm doing is just stressing him out.  


I just don't know what to do. Was I supposed to lie? Was I supposed to say; ""Okay yeah...I was really pissed off that you lied to me, but I think our friendship is stronger than that."" ?

Big hearts waiting for sunlight to blossom. They're very feminine but don't show it conventionally. They're like ""artists"", a lot of what they do is an expression of how they feel, fluid, passionate.

I explained that the box of items she hadn‚Äôt mailed were partially items that belonged to my now deceased father, and that if she couldn‚Äôt respond by the end of this week with an update, I would need to make other arrangements (the wording was vague but there was subtext referring to filing a small claims suit). I offered her money again, and also explained the logistical reasons why it needed to be sent this week. 

Finally, after 10 days of ghosting it seems she listened to this voicemail ... the next day, she emailed me informing me she sent it via courier and asked for $200 because she used express shipping. Of course, she deviated from the plan of using a cheaper service- if she‚Äôd emailed me and been responsive, she would have saved me a massive amount of money I‚Äôll soon be paying in express, handling and customs fees.

I write this topic, with the purpose of being able to understand a particular situation.

Get to know an ISFP-F28, for about a year, try to summarize as much as possible and list those facts that you consider important:

1.- We met in October 2018 (I was still in a relationship, which culminated in December 2019).

2.- In January 2019, she asks me ""How do I like women?"".

3.- In February, there was an episode, where during a meeting, she said ... ""Let's make our meeting fast, cuz things happen to me"".

4 .- \*\* Here in February, several people have told me that she was looking at me in a different way \*\*

5.- March, we worked in an office, I went to find a coffee and stop seeing information on the computer, when I arrived I had only drawn an emoji with my face and left it as a wallpaper.

6.- April, she told me: ""I have mixed feelings with you""

7.- May, she started drawing hearts while we were together

8.- May, we went to have some beers after work, and she told me: ""I think we have to say everything we have, and most likely our relationship will change""

9.- Usually, we had coffee, went to the movies, had lunch, had breakfast.

10.-October:

I would like to discuss something that involves both of us:

\- ""There are people who think I like you, but it's not like that ... you call my attention""

\- ""I admire you, I find you intelligent, handsome, friendly, cold""

\- She asked me this question ... ""Do you think that two people who are friends can have a relationship and then be friends again?"" ¬ø

isfp,"Please help, INTJ trying to work with an ISFP and after many attempts, I thought this might be the place to ask.

I have a friend who is an ISFP who I just reconnected with after a couple years. Two years ago she agreed to hold a box of items for me in her parents‚Äô house where she lives. I recently have asked her to ship these items to me and she agreed by phone to do so. She asked me when I needed it by and I told her preferably in the next two weeks.

It has now been 5 weeks and once a week for the last month, I email her to check in and see the progress. I have also offered her money but she has not supplied these details for payment. Last week I made it known to her that I have been on a deadline and need her to complete this task soon and to let me know if there‚Äôs anything I can do to help speed things along. Every week she responds with excuses like she‚Äôs ‚Äúout of town‚Äù or ‚Äúhas a stomach bug.‚Äù  For the last 5 weeks.

What can I do to stop this procrastination? These are precious items to me and I don‚Äôt think she is grasping how important this is. I know every person of this type is different but how on earth can I motivate her to please get this done ASAP? 

Many thanks in advance.",1571854895

But they dont say sorry back about their actions. Why?

Now I've taken it multiple times past months and can't get anywhere close to ISTP, only ESTP but lately been feeling some similarities with ENTP too. Also there are some attributes of ESTP's that I have no similarities to.

How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.

21, male. Not too bad looking, personality tends to change quite often based on what I value

Is there a medical diagnosis that impact your mental/comportamental stability somehow?

I've never seen a professional about my mental health so feel free to diagnose me too

Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?

Parents divorced at a young age, was the oldest brother and kind of matured pretty quickly because of that - trying to keep my little siblings out of trouble.

What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?

Studying in college at the moment but my main focus is music. Most of my energy goes to that, I often get pretty addicted to certain artists and like to study everything about them and their music and also trying to recreate that same magic in my own music. These artists tend to change after about a year it seems.

If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?

For a whole weekend I'd probably feel like I'm missing out on something. Going out on a friday, having some fun and spending the next days alone wouldn't bother me much though.

What is your relation with movement and your surroundings? For instance do you prefer a sport or outdoors event? If an outdoors event what is it? And why? If not what type of activities do you tend to engage in?

I've got some sport related hobbies I enjoy during the winter and summer, I like doing them and have a lot of fun too, I've never taken them too seriously though and have never pushed myself to be great at them. Suck at every game that requires throwing or kicking a ball though.

How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?

I'm curious about people mostly - It's very limited to some certain people though. Mostly myself and the musical artists I'm currently focused on. That's why I'm also interested in figuring out what type I am.

Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?

I feel like I can be good at a leadership position but it gets tiring fast for me. I don't like to organize things. I'm much better as an advisor, but I'm not afraid to take the reigns in my own hands for a very short period of time and I consider myself good at that.

Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?

I'm coordinated on my musical instruments, not too much in other things though. I've got no interests in working with my hands beside that either. I pay a lot of attention to my body language so it could look like I'm well coordinated but that usually isn't the truth.

Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.

I used to consider myself hopeless in arts a couple of years ago, but I do feel I've got some artistic qualities now. Right now I'm starting to like art that's surreal and with a vague meaning. I feel that also ties in with the chaotic nature of ENTP's.

What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?

I'm trying to avoid feeling nostalgic so I tend to leave the past behind. Only reasons I think of the future are my own ambitions and plans, everything else seems irrelevant. Aging scares me to death.

How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?

If I see that the request is coming from a genuine place then I'll help them out. I don't put too much thought into if I should or shouldn't. If people get too used to my help or seem ungrateful for my time then I usually stop helping them.

Do you need logical consistency in your life?

I don't think so, no. I try to be as unpredictable to myself as possible.

How important is efficiency and productivity to you?

It comes and goes. I get things done but often on the last minute. I try to be as productive as possible by boring myself. It feels like it's working.

Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?

I used to be pretty controlling on some close people. I'm not aware of doing it anymore though.

What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?

If I get interested in something I research it. If I need to pass an exam I'll read through the things and forget it after the exam. Never did do very good in school though.

How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?

Winging projects and improvising on the go for sure. If It's a group effort then I mostly go along the their strategy though.

What's important to you and why?

Starting to feel like a broken record but getting somewhere with my music lol. Also having a good financial situation so I wouldn't have to work 9-5 when I'm 40. I feel like most other stuff will fall into place.

What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?

Fear of somehow missing out on my youth and getting old. Death doesn't seem so scary but old age is - mostly because it doesn't seem so social

What do the ""highs"" in your life look like?

Traveling seems to be something I remember pretty fondly.

What do the ""lows"" in your life look like?

Losing my direction and my ambitions, getting stuck in my mind too much and being lonely.

How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?

Very focused on reality, it gets tiring in social situations so I try to focus on listening to music when I'm out most of the time. It doesn't really work though,

Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?

I think I'd be pretty confused. Probably would make an attempt to escape lol

How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?

I don't struggle too much with decisions, they happen quick. I'll do what seems right and that will usually still seem right a year later.

How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?

Typing all of this is trying to process my emotions. I'm trying to untangle my mind and understand my emotions.

Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?

Only if I'm trying to be polite to someone I like. Most of the time though I don't talk to find someone to agree with me and if nobody has anything to say then I let the conversation die out.

Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why would you?

Another reason for thinking I might be an ENTP now. Used to be the quiet kid, then the class clown, then a ""rebel"" a couple of years later. I like to challenge authority and break rules if the rule doesn't seem reasonable and I can get away with breaking it. I had a lot of troubles with my teachers in high school because of that but also had the respect of most of the class for speaking their and my own mind too. College seems a little boring since they don't give me much to rebel against.

What is the ideal life, in your opinion?

Right now I'd love to travel and play music. Also having enough passive income that money wouldn't be on my mind.",1571733880

My significant other is an ISFP and I have always wondered if there are little things I can do in particular that make him feel loved and care for. I understand everyone has their own love language and for the most part his seems to be acts of service‚Äî for example, he seems to be happy when I make his favorite lasagna, or surprise him with ice cream, or help him out with a task or errand. 
But sometimes he makes it seem like he doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúneed‚Äù me to do things for him. Without disclosing too much he dealt with some neglect in his childhood and I feel like that‚Äôs one of the reasons why he‚Äôs fiercely independent and tells me he doesn‚Äôt need me to do anything ‚Äúextra‚Äù. On his birthdays, for example, he always wants to do something small or even just stay at home. either way, I want to make him feel like he is cared for and that he can count on me.

Recently I‚Äôve come to conclude that I believe I am actually an ISFP. 

I know I have deep seated values that help decide how I remember certain interactions especially how I feel about certain people. Usually I don‚Äôt realize how I feel about them consciously unless I reflect. If someone rubs me the wrong way I react to it but I‚Äôm not sure if I know that I don‚Äôt like the person after that. When I‚Äôm out at the bars I think this leads me to push peoples buttons after they‚Äôve done something that I found was rude or disrespectful. A lot of times I have interactions I find to be negative, whether it‚Äôs a verbal altercation or someone being passive aggressive towards me. Friends always comment on how this happens to me and how they don‚Äôt understand why people react this way towards me. This makes me believe I lead with FI. I was a sensitive kid, I would cry a lot if people hurt my feelings. As an adult I literally disregard a person who upsets me as a fool etc. 

My passion is songwriting and country music. The beauty and truth of the life I had known growing up in Appalachia. My perfect day is a day alone with nothing to do besides write songs and do whatever it to keep mind content. 

Reasons I believe to be SE :

I love music, nature, coffee, booze, trying new foods, going to new cities, riding motorcycles, driving by myself, I‚Äôm a nit picker about how things look or sound. 

I hate trying to schedule things, over the past year I‚Äôve tried desperately to plan my life and I‚Äôve felt like a zombie, and have been stuck in analysis paralysis. 

I don‚Äôt connect with people too easily. Doesn‚Äôt help things that I don‚Äôt really care to connect with people because I‚Äôd rather be by myself if I can be. In the past month or two, the only conversations that have stimulated my mind are with old men about God and the lack of spirituality in our country at the moment. The path of the sinner and the search for salvation. But don‚Äôt take this as I‚Äôm devoted religious person, I haven‚Äôt went to church since I was a kid and I don‚Äôt read the Bible.

Fun times, but also many boring moments like when I would get bored of playing a certain game on the DS and then switch it to another one, then get bored of that one and keep repeating the cycle. And when I would ride my bike aimlessly around the neighbourhood when none of the kids were able to play. 

Teenager years. I moved into my Dad's house in Seattle. High School was meh, and most of my life consisted of school and League of Legends/Anime. I remember procrastinating so much with homework. I was a ghost. Nobody really talked to me. It's always been that way.

Teenager years continued. I notice signs of Anxiety and Depression. I just ignore them and hope they get better with time. Things aren't going to well at my Dad's house. My Dad notices that I am spending way to much time on the computer and my grades are dropping. I remember my Algebra teacher having a talk with me saying how it is going to be really hard for me to get my failing grade up to a passing grade. My Anxiety and Depression start to get worse. I start skipping classes. I remember becoming best friends with a guy named Benjamyn from my Chemistry class. We would work on Chemistry homework together at his house and sometimes chill at mine. 

I start thinking that Benjamyn is too clingy and ghost him. Back to only having 1 friend. 

I move back in with my Mom which is 3 hours away from Seattle to finish Senior year of High School at another school because I wanted a change. 

Senior year was pretty darn amazing in this small town. Teachers were great, lots of attractive girls and I had 2 really cool bodybuilder friends. I managed to get my 1.4 GPA up to a 2.0 and graduate. I loved being able to walk to school in 15-20 minutes from my house. My Mom didn't have internet at her house, but I somehow survived.

Life after graduation. The Senior Graduation Party was awesome! So much love, thought and effort was put into it all. I loved getting a massage from a professional massager. And getting a glittery tattoo of a koi fish on my arm.

Life after graduation continued. Things don't work out with my Mom and I so I move back in with my Dad in Seattle. My sister and everyone tells me to go to college since I'm not working. After a longgg time of just trying to hide in my room, I finally fill out my FAFSA form with the help of my best buddy. 

College. First day I was so lost and anxious. I came to school 2 hours early and sat in the cafeteria eyeballing my class schedule. Then I listened to some music. 

There was a really attractive girl in my Spanish class. My English professor was also attractive. My math professor was pretty strict. And I struggled so hard in math class.

My Anxiety and Depression show signs again. I start skipping classes and then just stop showing up to college completely. My family finds out and now I have to find a job.

My sister helps me land a job at a Grocery Store as a Courtesy Clerk. It wasn't bad at all. The hardest part was dealing with customers.

My Anxiety and Depression strike again and after 3 months, I quit the job. Become unemployed for like 1 whole year.

Fast forward to now. Just moved back in with my Mom after living with roommates for 5 months. Was struggling to pay rent because I worked an odd job and didn't have many hours. 

I realize that I took many things for granted and I feel so blessed to be able to live with my Mom without having to pay for rent or food. But, I'm not happy. 

I am running from my problems. I have to pay back Financial Aid because I withdrew from college. That is the thing that is stressing me out the most. Also, I have an overdraft fee of $5.00 that keeps adding up everyday on my bank account. 

My Mom is telling me to help clean the house. Going to do that now.

Life can be hard, that's not anything new. I dunno if I can keep going. I am starting to accept the fact that I have to feel the same pain that my family feels once I end my life. I just don't have anything to live for. Well we are all living to survive, but this advanced brain of ours wants more. We aren't cavemen and cavewomen. I don't want to die. I just want the pain to stop. Maybe I should just get a job and pay back my Student Loans and then live a minimalistic life in an apartment and go out in nature on my free time and soak up the sun. I dunno. Life life life. Fudge.

isfp,"I relate a lot to INFPs, so I barely questioned it when I scored as one over and over on your basic personality typing websites. After all, I am very intuitive and emotionally aware. Love spending time alone in self reflection or diving deep into the subjects that interest me the most. I am an artist. I love to write. I strive for authenticity and  have a strong code of ethics that I live by, which is all my own. You know, INFP stuff.

However, I couldn't help but notice some peculiar differences between myself and every other INFP I have ever met. For one, I am bolder. I don't fear being seen for who I am; and I love expressing myself through my art, clothes, my body language, and surroundings in a way that often gets me noticed - for better or worse - and I could care less either way. It seemed to me that other INFPs, while creative and original, tend to prefer not to be noticed at all, and shrink from the spotlight.

Also, I am a risk taker and I thrive off of novelty, thrill, and change. I often make split decisions to do something that most people would be terrified to do if the opportunity presents itself. Things such as moving cross country with only a few dollars to my name; driving a 50cc scooter from Portland, Oregon to the coast and back; spontaneous dancing in public places when a good song comes on; nerf gun wars with my friends while walking through the city; and a myriad of other fun and crazy shit that most INFPs are too busy brooding about their feelings to even consider. I really enjoy thinking on my feet and responding to challenges using whatever resources are available to me - in novel ways - and I am always confident that I will find a way to overcome any obstacles in my path. Not very INFP of me, eh?

Also, I am very sensitive to my surroundings. Being in an aesthetically pleasing environment or listening to music that I enjoy gives me a HUGE mood boost, whereas bad music and ugly surroundings can get me downright cranky. I literally cannot tune it out. Likewise, I do not feel comfortable unless I am dressed in a way I think is aesthetically pleasing as well. It's kind of annoying and ridiculous how enamored I get over pretty things. Most INFPs, however, seem to not give as many shits about that.  

I also tended to feel a little annoyed at how seriously most INFPs take themselves, and how much they tend to dwell on things instead of taking action. I mean, I get it - I really do. I have spent very long periods of time alone in my room, feeling sad and misunderstood. Brooding. Living solely in my head. But I always find pull myself out of it and take action on improving my life and self esteem, leaving my INFP friends in the dust.

Anyway, I am relieved. I love INFPs so much, but knowing that my ""true"" personality type is ISFP, feel a great deal more proud.

isfp,"Current boyfriend, dating since June. Had a few bumps in the road (feel free to read my previous posts). 

Boyfriend is... different...to all other men I've dated in the past. I've been in relationships with: ENFP, INTJ (x2), ENTJ, ESTP. Quite different to ISFP men obvs. 

Main issues have been his reluctance and awkwardness around saying how he feels and emotionally charged conversations. He tends to shut down with conflict, but is definitely trying to be more emotionally open. He is also quite independent, which would probably stress some women out, but he is currently on a business trip and I'm fine because I'm an INFJ and also quite independent. But he is definitely less 'attached' and dominant than previous partners I've had. 

Is this an ISFP thing? Because I'm so hyper aware of how he feels, as an INFJ, I don't push him for emotional disclosure. But do you think I should? Like asking him how he is feeling etc, more regularly? Or do ISFPs prefer not to do that? He does say he looks forward to seeing me when he returns and we've been apart for too long. 

He shows care and affection through actions. For example, buying me my favorite bag or flowers, or making sure I'm not hungry or always having water in the car. Being very flexible if I want to change plans, etc. Never pushing me to do things I am not comfortable with. He tries to please, he really does. But sometimes I feel is he just doing it to please me or because that is how he genuinely expresses affection?

Here's a bit about me (male);

\- I hate structure. I can't think of anything worse than being forced to wake up everyday at the same time, going through the same motions, routines and tasks day in day out, leaving at the same time and then doing it all over again I mean really forced to do it without any flexibility and never missing a day. I really don't like being told what to do either. (I'm self-employed). Having said that, following a similar structure at home is fine - just as long as I have some flexibility and choice in the matter. If I don't feel like working I will struggle to.

\- Always been described as quite laidback and easy going

\- Can get obsessed with a topic I find interesting where I go to bed hours later than I intended. It's not like I'm not aware and completely lose track of time, but I just have to find out as much as I can and can't stop 

\- Find it hard to make decisions. Like to have all the information. For example, when ordering a takeaway from a place I know I may look at other options but almost always end up ordering the same thing. When ordering from a new place I take time choosing something and then doubt if I made the right choice

\- I'm a bit of a perfectionist. While I can be spontaneous I like to know as much as I can about something before I undertake it. This is probably out of fear of not doing it well and feeling embarrassed

\- Very sensitive to criticism, especially from those I'm close to

\- Terrified of rejection and failure

\- Fearful of what others think

\- Generally quite optimistic even if I don't necessarily outwardly display it, thinking (perhaps naively) that everything will work out.

\- Can get addicted to things quite easily. 

\- Feel like I really need hope or some purpose in life. Recently had a business failure and I don't think I've ever felt as bad in my life. I had no hope for the future, negative thoughts etc. I was lost but then finally got out of it when I set plans for the future, although they're nothing too concrete or detailed

\- Very rarely share my feelings 

\- Went though a stage where I really liked reading about philosophy but only philosophers with practical application like how to live a better life

\- Can empathise, especially when those I'm close to share their troubles. I don't tend to give advice but just listen - sometimes thinking afterwards what can help

\- Prefer having a few close friends and hate being the centre of attention

\- I'm loyal and if you tell me a secret I will never tell another soul

\- Feel like I can charm anyone if I really wanted to...but it can take a lot of effort

\- Don't think anyone has ever hated me, at worst they'd be indifferent. I'm quite likeable and easy to get along with

\- I can read people well

\- I find my mind can drift if the conversation isn't something I'm interested in or is boring like small talk

\- I'm a happy drunk - sometimes I feel I'm at my best when I'm a little tipsy and I lose my insecurities and inhibitions

\- I like enhancing things. For example, I'm not much of a smoker but if I'm out with friends, have had a few drinks, I like to have a smoke to enhance the moment. When watching a film I like to get the setting just right

\- I was terrible at Maths in school

\- I don't read books much but when I do it's usually non-fiction

\- I'm a night owl. I go to bed at 2am.

\- I'm usually quiet when around new people.

\- Don't like conflict

\- Don't like it when people bitch about others

\- Feel like I'm bursting with potential that I haven't fulfilled if only I would go out there into the world and really live- I probably don't out of fear of failure and rejection.

\- Starting to think more and more about the past and regret as I'm getting older

\- I like alone time and definitely need to recharge after being social

\- I withdraw way too much

\- Along with music and film/tv I love sport more than anything else. More watching than playing but I liked to play when I was younger

\- I generally like staying fit - lifting weights a couple of times a week, ab workouts, a bit of cardio

\- I'm overly concerned with my appearance

\- I have a simple dress sense but like to think it looks well put together

\- I sometimes daydream, not about impossible things like unicorns but grounded in reality, often about recognition like being a famous musician

\- I play guitar, though nowhere near as much as when I was younger

\- I hate nothing more than a hypocrite 

\- I get all excited about something but actually putting it into action is a different story. I may start off excited but lose interest especially when results aren't immediately apparent

\- I generally stick to the same places, pubs, restaurants etc. but when I'm on holiday I love to explore and try new things

\- I struggle to see in me the positive qualities that everyone else tells me they can see",1570570137

One time I was sitting in a Discord channel talking to a mutual friend, and they came to lurk by sitting there, muted, while they texted their own friends - they've also said that they'd love if it was the other way round, like if they're in a Discord with their friend, playing video games, and if I just came and sat there.

Multipotentialite, for those of you who don't know the word, is, for short, the adjective used to describe a person who has an overly huge amount of hobbies and interests.

I am not sure I can belong to this group, since generally the multipotentialite is not mediocre at his wide range of skills, but can be good to very good. Nevertheless, I like to call myself one, because I do have a lot of hobbies.

I know there's a r/Multipotentialite, unfortunately it's been inactive for a while. I am curious to see how many isfps can relate to this?

Ive been opening up to close friends and really trying to be honest with myself and them when they ask. In efforts To discover who i am again and turn a new leaf. 

5 years ago i got out of a really bad depression that lasted 4 years without human interaction.
Been feeling that depression close by real hard since february of this year and trying all i can to fight it off. 

Well, im feeling really raw and want to cut off communication with everyone ive been talking to these past few months. Like disappear completely. Not for attention, i dont go back. Ive always ended relationships with people this way, i find goodbyes hard and prefer to just disappear.

Something I read said ISFP are very present and hate future oriented things while I do find this true sometimes I will admit I have my whole wedding where I wanna live and what ring I want all planned out and I‚Äôm only 19 and this changes every week it seems I can‚Äôt keep the same plan because I find something better or I second guess myself 

I‚Äôm super dorky and goofy I mean like I sing really obnoxiously on purpose and I love to dance weirdly in public as well as just constantly doing dorky funny things 

I also love fashion I don‚Äôt always love shopping and buying outfits but when I‚Äôm in the mood I ko it I love makeup too not flashy makeup but really simple elegant stuff I love looking expensive but also don‚Äôt like to overdress so if someone I‚Äôm with is dressed casual and I‚Äôm not I feel out of place and weird

I like art but I‚Äôm not really into it drawing is time consuming for me I much more like to look at it not draw it

I listen to music 24/7 and if I‚Äôm not I‚Äôm humming my favorite song I can‚Äôt live without it

I‚Äôm not emotional yet emotional I cry easily if I‚Äôm fussed at or yelled at but also very confident after I have cried so I get depressed if it‚Äôs big but if it‚Äôs small I cry and then talk myself up and turn into a sassy B 

And I also am somewhat organized in things like my work but my room looks like a hurricane flew through you can‚Äôt see my floor because there is too many clothes everywhere basically I keep my phone and computer organized and my life I try and organize but I often don‚Äôt and then my areas are hideously disorganized

I love animals and In a movie If a person dies I usually don‚Äôt cry but if it‚Äôs an animal I cry really bad if I see on the news a person died I feel sorry for them but if someone hurts a animal and it dies or even if it doesn‚Äôt die but gets hurt I like ugly cry really bad and then get enraged after I‚Äôm done crying

I'm going through a bit of a transition right now, trying to figure out what to do next. I worked four years as a data analyst and absolutely disliked that job, all in all I just find it too intangible for me. I'm much more of a practical, hands on person and prefer something where I see direct results. I always thought I should have studied something like engineering, though at some point I also did an internship at a carpentry and absolutely loved that! 

Anyways, so now I've quit my job and am doing a yoga teacher training, among other things. I have two more months to go. I was fascinated by the anatomy module and can't stop thinking about wanting to dive deeper into anatomy and learn more about how our body works. 

Does anyone have experience in physio and what do you like/dislike about it? Better yet, does anyone have a yoga background and is doing physiotherapy? 

What about other manual therapies like massage therapy or osteopathy?

Most people would say I'm pretty organized, I cant stand mess, it almost makes me cry for whatever stupid reason. If I'm going somewhere I like to know what will be there and what I might do. I wont plan in great detail on what to do but I'll think in terms of, ""oh yeah I can go there one day, but I'll see how it works out"".

isfp,"Hello everyone. I did 16personalities' test and according to the test I am ISFP. However there are some features that I can relate myself with INFP,INFJ and ENFJ. Let me tell some of my features.

I am a 22 years old male.

I am a quite and calm person.

I get bored so easily.

I am distracted easily.

I tend to see positive sides in events but also sometimes I worry about future.

Rather than talking, I really enjoy playing games. Both video games and games that are played in real life such as bowling, billiard.

When I take action I always consider will it affect people somehow?

When I speak I tend to form simple sentences. And also it is hard for me to express myself while speaking.

I usually do not share how I feel.

I question reason of human existence and religions but I actually hate it because it is suffering.If I am alone, which is often the case, I think about lots of things but I also hate it. 

When I live in the moment I am happier.

I relate myself with movie characters too much. Especially with Star Wars characters.

I am an introvert but with my friends sometimes I become extrovert.

I play violin.

I am interested in sport.

According to some comments I read, it says ISFP people are charming but I am not.

Unlike most ISFP's I am really good as student. I do a double major. However I do not really enjoy it. The reason why I do a double major is I realized that I do not really like what I study and I decided to study also psychology.

isfp,"i‚Äôve tested as infp for the past couple of years and definitely feel many, if not all of the characteristics of one but it was brought to my attention that i could possibly be isfp. I thought it would be a good idea to ask some isfp pals!!!


1. one of my favorite things to do is talk about/make up  crazy stupid scenarios about my current pet and past pets with my sister. we can go on for a while with it. we‚Äôve decided that our old wirehaired tiny mutt puppy(who was stolen from us years back) is currently a wheelchair restricted sociopath who speaks through a keypad/computer. 
1a. i do something similar with my friends. it‚Äôs more like a ‚Äúwhat if-‚Äú that maybe lasts longer than it should in face of interactions/situations  that we just witnessed. 

2. i find great peace in painting, meditating, giving others massages and making others laugh and or feel at peace. i absolutely love giving massages or being a listening ear because it feels like I can feel the weight lift off of them and their boundaries slowly come down. 

3. i am not religious at all and at an early age I realized this as well. I went to Sunday school as a kid and went to a Christian preschool. I can remember wondering how people came about and how surreal it was that I existed. I can remember asking my mother at a young age if she loved me more or god more which is sooo wild to me. as a kid, I didn‚Äôt see god as a creator but more of a scary observer.
3a. im not religious but i do get into chakra alignments and that type of stuff. 

4. i really don‚Äôt like it when strangers or people that I don‚Äôt know approach me. i get super stressed out but i try my best to appear welcoming and kind because everyone deserves that until proven otherwise!
4a. in small groups class work groups, i feel extremely uncomfortable and want to cry but i find myself trying to speak up more to break the ice because i don‚Äôt want the other group members to feel uncomfortable.

4b. in small friend groups, I am loud with them!! we are loud together!!  people stare and I feel guilty for a moment but then one of us makes a rly funny joke and i can‚Äôt help myself

5. i love seeing nature and often think about how life would be if things were much different than they are now. i find beauty in every season  (but still kinda hate summer but that‚Äôs really just because my car has NO A/C!!!!!)

6. im an extremely private person. once opening up about the simple fact that I have an issue with anxiety almost made me cry.

7. i‚Äôm politically leftwing (leftist to be exact). i generally don‚Äôt like conflict but find myself speaking against those who make terrible statements against marginalized groups. 

7a. though I am an extremely sensitive person, i wouldn‚Äôt be hurt if someone  thought less of me because of my political views. i think i would be a little annoyed or angry though.

8.i have an addictive personality 

9. i envy those who can shrug things off and do what their hearts want so effortlessly. i often get trapped between what i want to do and what I‚Äôm ‚Äúsupposed to do‚Äù or what I  think makes sense.  it often causes me to get sad or stressed.  

10.  i randomly send close friends texts about how proud I am of them and how wonderful  certain parts of their personalities are

isfp,"Dear ISFPs,

I've wondered lately why I don't like having a job and complain all the time (my reddit history is full of this shit tbh), and now I find it comes to self-confidence, obsessiveness about my hobbies, and overall lack of understanding of work organisation.

1/ hobbies : It's pretty clear that I'd prefer engaging in a hobby than in my day-to-day job activities. Every evening, every week-end is spent almost exclusively on hobbies. I can't, I suck it up, all right.

2/ self-confidence and commitment : I have the gut feeling that no one really cares about me and my well-being in the job environment. I often find myself envying job-related series, in particular all those USA police series where all the guys have a crazy, crazy life, but never fail to support each other, even when internal conflicts occur. I don't trust colleagues, I cannot turn them into friends, because they have an expectation : that I do my job correctly. They'd turn up on me if I do job mistake. Which I can do often because basically, slacking around for more than 5 min is a terrible thing.

3/ work organisation : I have the gut-feeling that work organisation does not give a shit about me and my well-being, either. The way I have to file forms for taking vacation, that I need to take days-off (not paid) every time I need to visit a doctor of sorts, heck, even the death of a loved one is constrained by stupid rules! I will never understand it has to be that way. Every time I got personal shit going in my life, it will threaten either my job position or my overall comfort (less vacation, less pay, etc)!

I can't even think of opening my own business because I'm no salesman nor administrative-man, I cannot fathom the SUPERB universe of invoices, taxes, suppliers, service providers, customer service, accounting, etc.

I don't feel like changing to another industry will do the fix, because it's costly to do that (new student status for a while, low-pay starting jobs, etc), and I don't even know whether I would feel any better in another industry, which if I don't, it will be yet another wasted effort.

I need to find strategies to have faith in the future and in myself keeping a steady income, following ""the rules"". Did you ever feel like this? How do you usually do to carry on to the next day without thinking of quitting?

Thanks,",1569397680

I mean people like extremely unhealthy ESTJ's that have a massive power complex and will get ready to throw down over the tiniest thing.

Right now the only solution I have found to dealing with people like them is to just run away.

My stepdad and I and I've made a lot of posts on him so it's not exactly a secret at this point that I don't like him, anyway to say we don't get along would be an understatement. 

So what I do is I avoid him as much as possible. I only work until about 5 at night, but I pretend to work until 7 or sometimes 8 so that when I go home I can pretend like I'm just tired as all get-out and head straight to my room without being bothered. I don't work on Sundays, but I have been pretending that I do for the last several months now. I pretend to have an all-day job on Sunday and then I go home and pretend like I'm just totally worn out from it.

And I mean I would love to just talk to him. I would honestly love that. If I could just sit him down and get him to see things from my point of view and tell him that he just needs to stop being hypercritical, and getting pissed off about literally everything, and most importantly if he's mad at me about something or if I've done something that he thinks it's wrong I would appreciate it if he could just talk to me normally instead of flying into some kind of hypercritical rage mode.

Here's the very brief backstory: after 1 month of dating he said ""I love you"", I didn't believe him bc he had seemed casual abt me (later will elaborate why) and I accused him of being weird by saying it too early, been long siaty for 1 more month. Been dating 2.5 months in total.

No more verbal definitions of the relationship, he's extremely private, won't open up about personal(and even not so personal) things, very dry texter - and it makes me feel like in between the dates we're strangers. In person, he gives me his whole attention and is very considerate. But the fact that he's so private, doesn't share what's on his mind, distances himself when he's down, doesn't confront if I hurt him bothers me a lot and makes me feel like I'm not actually important to him.

He does try to make effort now that I communicated this. I really care abt him and try to give him time and space to feel comfortable with me to be himself, as I really value transparency and sincerity in a relationship. However, part of me gets really frustrated with all this and feels like I'm putting more effort than he is and just getting more and more attached to him just to get very disappointed and heartbroken once. I don't know how to talk abt it bc don't want to force things and scare him away, but we're not having the ""where do we stand"" conversation and this relationship is taking a very weird unknown route.

I have read that it's common for ISFPs to have this trait, but I'm sure some don't really feel affected by it or don't have any issues with being guarded.

I am very good at making friends. I tend to be the sort of person who is chill enough for other people to approach, but friendly enough to where I can keep them engaged.

Now, perhaps I've just had an extremely long string of bad luck...but I feel like pretty much everyone I've been friends with treats me like I'm some kind of new toy that they really like for a while, and then decide that they don't like me anymore somewhere down the road.

I have had one too many friendships just end abruptly. In real life all of my friends have moved away to different states.

My online friends usually stick around for about 3 to 6 months... And then one day out of the blue they decide to just stop interacting with me.

And I understand that people have lives and move on, but most of them make it really apparent that they are not ignoring me because they're busy... It becomes apparent that they literally want nothing to do with me.

Like this one girl and I who honestly if she ever wanted to be friends again I would take her back in a heartbeat...we were friends for about three months and then she blocked me on Discord. I left a message on a story she wrote and her response was to just delete the message.

In any case, I‚Äôve never been able to figure out how to communicate with him effectively.

I would probably describe him as an unhealthy ISFP‚Ä¶ mainly because this guy just does not know how to be responsible or take care of himself (mainly why I broke up with him). He was very sheltered as a kid and has lived a very privileged life‚Ä¶ but that privilege has basically run out (i.e. his parents are no longer paying for everything).

He‚Äôs spiraling into a deep financial hole right now‚Ä¶ and all his decisions seemed to be ‚Äúfeelings‚Äù or ‚Äúemotions‚Äù based. I told him it was a bad idea to put his rent on a credit card; he did it anyway. Basically everything I advised him not to do like that, he did‚Ä¶ and everything I suggested he do, he refused to. Of course, I am not the only one trying to communicate life advice to him.

The thing is, although he is super depressed, he insists on ‚Äústaying positive‚Äù. It seems, to me, a lot of his problems stem from the fact he will not acknowledge there is a problem. He has literally said to me, through tears but smiling and also laughing, ‚ÄúI just gotta stay positive!‚Äù It‚Äôs disturbing.

He won‚Äôt get a normal job for two reasons (we have a web design biz together, but it is faltering‚Ä¶ bc of his bad decisions): one, he is allegedly suffering from debilitating tinnitus; two: he recently bought an RV and some packaged deal that allows him to stay at participating RV parks anywhere in the country for free‚Ä¶ but only for two weeks at a time‚Ä¶ which means he can‚Äôt stay put long enough to make any money.

Anyway‚Ä¶ I suspect he is just so caught in his Fi and Se, and he has no idea how to utilize his Te. Only when he is personally interested in something and it aligns with his own values (Fi) and makes him feel good (Se), will he learn (Ni) something.

isfp,"So to start off HI! I am an ESTP (Males) but was a near miss from ESTJ so as every website tells me it's one hell of a good match for an ISFP and holy shit is it kinda of crazy how things just click. But I am not talking about that. Anyhow I met this ISFP girl and we have been talking and we wanted to take things slow. Things went well we went on a few dates we did end up having sex but that might just be because making out makes me horny and her as well. Not really slow... but we both kind of fucked that up. She told me she felt bad about that and like I get that as it was never my intentions. Anyways we dialed it back a bit and have gone on a few more fun little dates. Things like going to a fair or other fun and or nerdy things (being vague but it doesn't really matter). Anyhow we were talking the other night and I noticed how sometimes her mindset is like being more than a friend almost like we are dating and sometimes it's the exact opposite. For example holding her hand is a 50/50 gamble and either annoys her or she likes it. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I decided to ask what was going on because I don't want to like push her away or whatever.... So she broke the news that she still is in love with her ex and doesn't really want to be. The guy still messages her and she gets annoyed and angered and keeps responding even though she doesn't want to. The kicker is she says she likes everything about me and doesn't have a single complaint. Everything is perfect and she has no reason to not want to progress with things. She said the one thing she had with him that we don't have is a feeling she has when she kisses me is not as powerful as when she kisses him? I kind of understand that but in my head generally that feeling gets bigger overtime so it's confusing me. So ISFP's out there can anyone chime in? Does it takes you guys/gals a long time to get over someone. This girl is pretty much perfect right now and I am always willing to give it a shot. I am not sure if I am going to be wasting my time if this is a really long process for them to get over someone or what.

Huge possibility I just needed to rant. But any advice or good vibes sent my way are appreciated ;)

isfp,"PLEASE HELP! I'm actually confused whether I'm an INFP or ISFP.
0. I think about why am I even alive. I think about my purpose. I'm a 20 year old male college student living in the Philippines.
1. I HATE PEOPLE JOINING BANDWAGON in every single aspect of life. I HATE TRENDY THINGS (and usually consider myself as a ""trend maverick""). But I do love wearing my favorite vest because I ""feel"" cool and confident in it. 
2. I get dangerously angry when I'm constantly told what to do and what not to do especially at home (parents are so control freaks, but I do feel bad afterwards for throwing tantrums and then I feel bad, sad and depressedt AF then cry cry cry myself to sleep. Toxic = me)
3. I suddenly think of ""random wierd moments"" in my head, usually of things I did/said/encountered in the past that makes me either giggle, regret, cry, cringe and perhaps even say something ""unintelligible"". Like ""what no adjjddjd"" sort of stuff.
4. I hate detailed planning but often make ""to-do/bucket list"" when things get crazy hectic. Legit journal writing bores me but i love having notebooks for my random doodles/thoughts.
5. I've always hated poetry because way back in highschool, I viewed it as ""mainstream"", uninteresting and forced. I always hated my classmates for trying hard to be so ""poetic"" to please the language-subject teachers. But I do love other literature like novels and fiction tho.
6. I love daydreaming and imagining stuff I could do or things about fantasy worlds.
7. I'm socially anxious all the time. I'm consicous about the things I say out in public. I'm generally interested in people but am skeptical to some. I sometime try my hardest to relate to others but sometime I can't find myself in their situations (love relationships, NAIVE 100)
8. I go ""procrastinating"" when I'm pressured on work/school projects. But even if I don't have things to do, I still procrastinate. LOL.
9. I saw descriptions for both ISFPs and INFPs, I don't usually like abstract things, but super-detailed things bore the heck out of me either. 
10. I like trying new things, but also scared by bad things that could happen when I do it so I somethings end up not doing it at all. 
11. I question ""traditional"" rules/policies that I think is pure BS like ""no long hair for boys in school"" rule/policy.
12. I love animals but also scared by traumatic experience, I used to ""body worship"" a cat all the time but now I scared to get sick/disease when I touch an animal. So I binge watch animal videos just for fun.
13. I love starting art projects but that depends on the mood i'm in. (which is rare)
14. I hate criticisms down to the core.
15. When I feel betrayed/hurt by a person I consider that person already dead to me. I don't forgive that easy.
16. I love songs with unique meaning/relatable lyrics to me but I can determine/remeber/memorize a song by its tune/melody first rather than the lyrics. (also hate popular songs,I usually like a popular song after it's no longer popular, silly me.)
17. I'm super self-critical most of the time but sometimes thing that I'm unique too. I also think that no one really gets me.
18. I'm always ""pseudo- romatically"" fantasizing about ""that destined bestfriend/partner who will be like a ""hero"" to my whole life (or the next.) I'm super picky on who I trust and am reluctant to easily label people as ""friend"". I hate being given ""physical""  affection (but I fantasize recieving it by ""hero"") I can give physical affection if I'm in the mood.
19. I hate conflicts/injustice and usually don't like to be caught in the middle of two people arguing/fighting but I suport the underdog when I see one.
20. I ABSOLUTELY HATE BULLYING, specially when my ""person"" is disrepected I don't think for a second whether to defend myself. I just do, Either I fight back or I ""reject/ignore/erase"" that person out of my presence by leaving the area.

On a last note I took several personality tests online and I mostly get INFP (sometimes INTP) but when I saw a reddit post on ISFP entitled ""Caring for your ISFP, Handling and Usage Guide"" (gosh, I loved that ""Angry Child mode"") it kinda resonated with how I feel but also not quite fully me(just like INFP guides too. I appreciated those posts. 
Thank you so much for helping me sort myself out. Also, sorry for the wrong grammar and wrong choice for better words, punctuations and spelling errors. english is just my second language next to Filipino. Again, AWESOME THANKS for helping me.

isfp,"I'm always getting these personalities when I do the test, but I don't know which is truly me. I think it's good to know ones personality in order to grow as a person.

Well.. let's talk about how I am.

- I am not a planner at all and I'm not a very clean person. Most of my day go by with me reading manga or sci fi books, anything which has something worthwhile to tell. When I wake up in the morning I don't know what to do at all. My room can be very messy without me even noticing, my twin brother has to tell me to clean, or else i won't do it.
I NEVER plan anything, when I do, I just forget about it anyway.

- I love fantasy, sci fi, post apocalyptic Worlds and horror. I feel as though these have the most beautiful things to say about the world, it's people, hell pretty much anything. When someone says beautiful in a movie, game or book in any of these genres, it's like having the first coffee in the morning.

- I don't think I'm an empath, but I can cry easily over generally weak characters or people because I see myself in them. If you know One Piece, I literally almost fainted from crying over Chopper's past. I can't even watch that part anymore.

- I get so angry over shallow people, who has nothing Interesting to say about anything. It's as though I get angry at them because they won't come out from their shell.

-I'm very passive and abit cowardice to talk to thinking types (especially my former ESTP coworker) because they ruin my theories and dreams

I find that as I'm interacting with other people I sometimes try out different things to see how they react.

So people don't know which me (experiment) they are going to get. I can have vastly different ways of interacting with people depending on where I'm coming from.

isfp,"Mods can feel free to remove if I vialote any rules. I rarely post on reddit if anything so here goes.

Being a non-religious male, I made it a point to not date anyone who is strongly religious because of obvious reasons (fundamentally different beliefs).

Personally I grew up in a Buddhist-oriented family with it being a part of my life. But as I mature in thoughts and read up more on Buddhism (and other religions), I realised that I couldn't accept those beliefs any longer and decided to just rely on myself. I found it to be empowering as you are not relying on a ""greater being"" for what you accomplish and I never looked back again.

Fast forward to present, I recently met with this attractive girl from a group project (I'm an undergraduate) and we kind of hit along pretty well with each other. BUT then I found out that she's actually a devout Christian. Not going to lie in my mind I actually started putting mental barriers against her (had some bad experiences with very religious people in the past not saying all of them are that way but I am just unlucky). 

Without any experiences on dating a religious girl, I looked up the internet to find out how on Christians' opinion on dating non-Christians and the results are not looking good. No offense to any Christians out there but don't mind me being blunt but in my opinion the idea of putting some ""Greater One"" before your sprouse or your family sounds like an absolute bullcrap to me. You should be living for family/loved ones if not yourself not some imaginary being.

Today she invited me to dinner and board game session with her friends. To be honest, I was elated when she asked but then my mind immediately went to the most unpleasant thought: what if all she wanted was to you know to join her church and become a christian.... And as it turns out it was dinner with her church friends and (I found out that) she even invited guys (non-religious) she met a few hours prior. Obvious that she and her friends are looking to add new people to their church.

For real it feels like a hopeless case as it seems like I'm fighting an uphill battle and I'm not gonna win. I know there are cases with marriage of christians with non-believers or even aethists but this really brings me back to my point of having fundamentally different beliefs. Not being able to be there for her when she needs me vice versa.

Life always seem to like to set us up in these tricky situations. Once again I would like to apologise if my thoughts seemed insensitive and offensive to anyone typing this essay at 1:50am...

Then we were long distance for another month and we barely texted bc, like I figured, being a bad texter is typical for ISPFs who like to be in the moment. He told me right away to not overthinking his texts and that he'd rather spend time with me irl.

I read it's common for ISFPs to be bad texters, take a long time to reply, be very brief etc. Last time we facetimed, it was after we texted back and forth for a few min straight (which never happens) so I called him and he said ""I was hoping you'd call""! When I obviously wanted him to call and it looked like if i didn't initiate we wouldn't have spoken lol.

I know ISFPs aren't rly initiative. But sometimes it's hard not to read too much into it. We haven't spoken for a week now and he's about to come back from his trip. I want to know if he's back and if he wants to see me but I feel weird initiating. After that FaceTime call, I was the one who texted first and as soon as I stopped we're not talking! I know he might be traveling and whatever, you guys don't seem to need/want to text your friends much besides making plans if necessary. But he's online at times, watches my stories and keeps quiet.

Can ISFPs be not initiative even if they're interested? Is it common for them to just not feel like texting or to wait for the other person to reach out? Should I reach out and if yes, what would he want me to say? Or should I give him space?",1566965326

- I'm constantly trying to get her to be in touch with her feelings. She asks for advice or talk about things that bother her, but won't acknowledge a root cause or how she actually feels, so she'll spend a long time dancing around a seemingly minor thing without getting to the point. 

- she places a lot of value on the prestige of institutions. Looks up to peers who attended Ivy League schools, has only worked at financial corporations, cares about the ranking of a uni for a potential partner. This way of thinking bothers me a lot, and I don't think it serves any practical purpose except to create fuss about things that don't actually matter.

- we're both frugal, but she takes it further than me. At some point, lining up for a free item that you don't really need is a waste of time. Also I don't get the purpose of her laser focus on every dollar and cent -- for me, I'm thinking about retirement, but for her, it's more the thrill of gaming the system

isfp,"Hey guy! I hope you all are doing well! So I have a question about myself. I can‚Äôt decide if I‚Äôm either more ISFP or INFP. I feel like I‚Äôm more ISFP because I can spot things really well. So here goes a little something about me for you guys to decipher. 

1. I can spot things really quickly and easily. My parents always tell me that I have a good eyes and I can easily see any thing from the corner of my eye. I can also tell if something is off pitch like in music or singing or a chord progression or whatever. Haha. Also when meeting someone...I think I tend to focus on their outer looks before wanting to get to know them (I know...very shallow...but I‚Äôm not!) 

2. I love my own personal space. And I‚Äôve been told that I‚Äôm a good dance and I have a good sense of rhythm (unlike my brother haha he can‚Äôt dance.) I hate it when I‚Äôm in my room by myself and I‚Äôm singing something or dancing and then all of a sudden my parents or anybody walks in and interrupts me. It makes me angry and embarrassed and usually I storm off into a different room or I just look at them highly annoyed. 

3. I tend to care about my looks sometimes. I‚Äôll look in the mirror and make faces and see if I look good...some days I don‚Äôt care but usually I do. 

4. I tend to be more shy and reserved at first but most of my friends be mistaking me for a extrovert because I have a childish energy about me that comes out and I can be goofy as hell haha. Also, when I‚Äôm describing something? I guess I tend to be very descriptive giving details. For instance, if I‚Äôm ‚Äúrole playing‚Äù with someone, I‚Äôll give lots of details (even though it‚Äôs a pain sometimes) and be pretty specific.

5. I tend to have a bit of an imagination...sometimes I like to visualize myself as a singer performing on stage when I‚Äôm at home by myself while singing and dancing (sorry if that sounds repetitive.) But also...my dreams tend to be pretty realistic...idk if that happens to you guys but yeah! I‚Äôm not very artsy...I can imagine something in my head and visualize it but I can‚Äôt draw it because I don‚Äôt have the skills to draw something haha. I also tend to learn better by hands-on. And sometimes....I pick up on bad vibes or energy and I hate arguments for real...until someone‚Äôs tries to control me or micromanage me? That‚Äôs when I get highly annoyed and may go on the offense and become pretty bitter.

First off, I love dating an ISFP... We are so different but have the important internal values in common and we thrive being authentic and silly with each other. This has by far been my favorite relationship and I love him deeply.

We are now approaching a year of dating and have been seeing each other for over a year. We have learnt how to understand and communicate with each other so much more than day one when we met.

BUT..

A key difference I recognize in us  is my desire to think into the future and his desire to only think present.

I will say : ""I want what I choose now to work into my future plans."" --&gt; Meaning, I want someone to want the same future as me and what I want in my future determines the choices I make now.

He will say: ""What is current is what is relevant and I can't promise anything beyond this point."" --&gt; I use to mistaken this as him not committing, but what I believe he means is that things can change so he doesn't want to promise anything that is too far for certainty.

Anyway, this use to be a point of conflict, but I believe we understand each other significantly better now. But is this a big difference that an INFJ (NiFeTiSe) and an ISFP (FiSeNiTe) would face???

We usually talk for hours about random things and we've always been friendly to each other (even tho \*sometimes\* he can be flirty). I'm just really confused cause there's mixed signals everywhere... An example: yesterday I had the courage to follow him on ig and he surprisingly texted me asking me about it after a week that I gave up on him cause he left me on read in the middle of a convo lol. At first he was kinda rude (non intentionally I believe) so I acted kinda hurt cause Im a sensitive ass btch lol (ofc I was subtle about it tho and just said ""um alright"") and he left me on read. BUT! after 15 mins he texts me asking me how I'm doing in a really awkward way?!???! He rarely asks me questions so I was shook. Plus, he insisted on getting me to open up and I did (he's been really sweet and caring about it), which was really strange cause he's always been very reserved and he never talked about very deep stuff with me. So we talk for two hours, but it's late and I tell him that he should go to sleep if he's tired.

Feels like just ignoring these thoughts and focusing on improvement is not a beneficial strategy since these thoughts will re-emerge later.

Looking at stuff objectively that's probably not true, but certain failures in my life have kind of made me feel like I'm stunted in a lot of ways. I could go on and on about these failures, for the most part I try to just improve in other areas for the future, but it's hard to not think about them when I meet new people and they all seem so much better than I am. And I know you aren't supposed to directly compare yourself to other people, we all have our own journey and stuff, but it's like I don't fit in or something in my head tells me that these people will never see me as an equal.

isfp,"He is going to take her out on a date soon. Happy for him. He is the most responsible and the manliest one out of all of us in the house. I love him a lot as well, and am very proud of him. Takes some balls to ask someone that attractive and almost perfect out. 

I can't help but wonder what would have happened if I asked her out? I'm not where I want to be in life so my self esteem and confidence is pretty low. The words that a church institute instructor told the class ring true. I understand the meaning now. It is a good idea to work on yourself every day and to work hard towards becoming a person that someone would want to be with. Aka, being healthy both mentally and physically, having good finances and being passionate about that one thing/having goals. It's good to be ready so when the time comes that you meet the person of your dreams, you have all the qualities that they would be attracted to.

The saying ""there are plenty more fish in the sea"",   can have more than one meaning. Its main meaning is used to tell someone to not be sad about a relationship ending, there are many other people out there. After witnessing and knowing a girl as perfect and amazing as Haley, that saying means something else to me. It means that there are plenty of other potential partners out there for you, but it's just that. Plenty of fish, but none in particular are as special. Not saying that Haley is the only special girl in the world, everybody is special and everybody is a miracle. I just, damn...

I'm feeling what she said this one time. Feeling it a lot. Her crush rejected her and if she couldn't have him, she would have no one. He was the only one, so she thought. This too shall pass for me I think. Haley is the girl that I spend the most time with, so it's natural that I think that she is the only one for me. She is really cool though.

Maybe what my homeboy said will happen to me and I will look back at all of this and laugh. Maybe there will be that one woman that I feel an instant connection to. It just happens. That spark. Soulmate/Twinflame type of feelin'. My homie said it happens when you least expect it. Haven't experienced it yet. I might one day. But damn am I proud of my boy and excited for him. I am a lil envious of him, ain't gonna lie. Dammit Haley, dammit emotions. Why you gotta make me feel this way. This is an important feeling to feel though, so I'm grateful. An importante lesson. She is not the only one for me. Emotions are just really strong. And ideals. It's like when you go through a breakup and are devastated in that moment in time. Then you get over it. This too shall pass.

The reason I think she‚Äôs ISFP is that she is very reserved, appearance is very clean, attended-to, and professional with also some personal flair (tattoos and dyed light gray hair despite being mid 20s), top customer service, merchandising, and listening skills, makes an effort to accommodate everyone‚Äôs preferred schedule, pleasant and nice, and speaks in concrete language, on topic. 

She also hired me on the spot with no reference check as I think we‚Äôre similar personality wise and vibed immediately/value the same things in a workplace based on the interview I had with her. She also cares for others and promotes people from within for key holder and section leader positions and listens to how they like their job and what they need. When the store gets busy she goes with the flow and helps anyone who needs it.

Probably my main clues for ISFP is carefully attended to but unique personal style, reserved and caring nature, and concrete ‚Äúhere and now‚Äù thinking style but I just feel it too. 

I left an emotionally abusive boss with horrible boundaries not too long ago who was ESFJ, and I told my new ISFP manager in the interview that I didn‚Äôt mind lower pay if the work environment is peaceful and supportive/cooperative and the attention is on the work and the store rather than drama and politics. 10/10 love working for another ISFP.

isfp,"I love the ISFP ""thinking out loud"" monologue. I think I'd like to listen to it every day, in fact.

&amp;#x200B;

Technically, I'm an INTP with high-functioning autism. ... Think of me *like* an ISFP who, instead of sometimes having extroverted moments, I instead sometimes have moments of thinking alone about how life works and how to improve it. ... The desire ""gently breathe life in"". The desire to create, perform, be epic and playful. The desire to see something beautiful in every heart, and express something beautiful everyday -- I share these desires.

&amp;#x200B;

Wait -- this post will sound all over the place, because it's me getting me thoughts straight, so hear me out:

&amp;#x200B;

I love dancing, performing, role play (acting), talking with funny accents. And I also love quiet moments of quietly taking in the surroundings with someone I love.

&amp;#x200B;

My dream is to find an awesome female ISFP who wants to share the ""dance of a lifetime"". ... I have been learning how to make vanlife work -- you know -- traveling all over USA in a minivan. And I want to share it with someone who is creative and playful, who is brave enough to ""face the monsters in the closet"" (to the conquer the irrational anxieties that, when challenged, will rear their heads and become terrors, before vanishing forever).

&amp;#x200B;

After establishing some portable work gigs for monthly income (or simply saving up for 3-6 months at a time), we would tour the USA, recording music for our live youtube music channel, and recording for our live dancing gig, as we busk (perform on the street).

&amp;#x200B;

I have a lot of music experience, and I can learn and then teach any musical instrument. And she will probably be better at dancing, physical coordination, drawing in a crowd with her smile.

&amp;#x200B;

Everyday, regardless of whether or not we have a third youtube channel for discussing/reacting to popular videos with funny accents and comedic commentary, we will at least do a tough-love rolpplay, off the air, just for ourselves, of playing ""devil's advocate"" where we go over each's thoughts, plans, and interests while pretending to be hard-knock bosses from Brooklyn and we create a daily environment for each other where we can speak assertively in a safe space (nothing against Brooklyn, it's all for fun and fun-ctionality).

&amp;#x200B;

We will have a multiple ""pet names"" for each other that communicate very specific needs and desires. ... Examples: If I call hear ""sweetheart"" then I want to hug and cuddle. If I call hear call her ""Mamma Bear"", then I want to be child-like for her and let her play with my hair or let me rest in her lap. If I call her ""Princess"", then it's her turn to be child-like and my turn to be protective (and daddy-like). ... If she isn't feeling what I suggest though the pet name, then she responds back with a pet name that tells me what she wants right then, instead. And we also do the opposite (with her initiating through a pet name and me following/accepting, or me counter-offering through a different pet name).

&amp;#x200B;

Most likely problems and solutions, from us both being IxxP's:

(1) We will have times where neither of us wants to make a decision or take the lead ... Solution: we will sometimes role a die, flip a coin, put ideas in a hat, let an arbitrary framework make trivial decisions for us

(2) We will both not like conflict ... Solution: in addition to having an ""openly assertive discussion"" roleplay-like experience every day with the tough-love Brooklyn accent, we will also write down and read aloud, each week, our relationship: non-negotiable boundaries, frustrations/concerns, demands, suggestions, victories, general appreciations for each other

(3) She will probably need more small talk and extroverted experiences then I can provide, and I will probably need to speak analytical ramblings more than she would enjoy hearing ... Solution: we keep channels open to our friends who share those modalities of thought, such as over the phone and facetime (in my case, I chat on my computer with my friends that enjoy heavy analytics, for example, and they respond at their convenience)

So Jaden and Willow Smith are long term obsessions. I find these two to be intellectual powerhouses as well as artistic geniuses. They're a bit odd and eccentric, but very true to themselves.

As they've gotten older, it almost seems like they finally have the freedom to wear their identity on their sleeve. I can really relate because I grew up with two very successful parents who were also really attractive and had an image to protect. So I couldn't really let loose until I was out of my house.

Our parents can be a bit intense sometimes and I know he doesn't like that, and I struggled with it myself when I was younger.

Besides for that he has been very considerate, sweet and caring to me. I thought my actions conveyed that I have feelings for him too, but I didn't verbalize them then.

Originally I thought he wasn't so honest bc it seemed too soon, and now, while we're long distance for a month, he doesn't rly keep in touch (texts once a day, one word answers, no real conversations. This is just not the way I would text someone I like - but I'm an INFP).

Then I realized that it's an ISFP thing to not like texting, and in his language all this might have actually meant he was making effort - am I right?
How easy is it for a male ISFP to say ""I love you""? Do they only say it when they mean it? Or can they be dishonest and say it, like, when they want sex?

So our story started about a week ago where we met through mutual friends in a group night out before a rave that we were going to. We ended up having some nice conversations and me, her and a mutual friend went back to my place after the night out and just chilled. Later that night after the mutual left we ended up hooking up and she stayed over till the next day.

The next day was the rave itself and we ended up being each others ravebaes (basically like a ravedate) the entire night and hugged a lot and kissed, however it is at this point I am not too sure if she is just treating me as a good friend or if she is more interested. 

After the rave we began talking and we met up a few times during the week to study for our finals together, despite the fact that she told me she normally prefers studying by herself due to people being distracting in group study sessions. During these study sessions we ended up planning some fun trips together (I am the really adventurous type) such as overnight hikes and a roadtrip to another city to attend another rave together. 

She seems to also put a lot of effort into talking to me such as always asking me about my day and what I am planning to do for the day. The last interaction we had was yesterday when I accidentally did a little bit too much magic mushrooms and had a bit of a bad trip, but she came out to come and be with me even though I knew she had to be studying that night.

So guys am I reading a little bit too much into it? Am I stupid for thinking she might like me or is she just treating me as a good friend?",1566021279
isfp,"Hi everyone thanks for listening to my worthless talking once again. I only have 3 friends none of them living in the same country I do. Two of them I met in a trip and we meet once a year the other one is an online friend have never met irl probably never will. I consider them very important and I do actively talk to them. However I do live with my parents and I guess parents get concerned about their daughters and so they constantly ask me why I don‚Äôt go out and I don‚Äôt have the heart to tell them it‚Äôs because I‚Äôve no friends to go out with. I have not always been like this but one way or the other I have found myself completely isolated from any irl friends I did have. I had a lot of friends while in school I guess because it was mandatory and I did have loads of fun with them but now that I am uni I am completely isolated but at least I have studying buddies I guess ( people I strictly study with ) 
It‚Äôs not that I feel lonely it‚Äôs just that I feel worthless and like a true horrible awful person who‚Äôs not even worth a birthday message",1566002286

isfp,"I'm trying to break this ISFP habit of not contributing enough/flaking out on replying to this subreddit. So I'm interested in seeing what sort of things make you happy about existing on this planet!

For me - looking at sunsets/ beautiful skies; seeing impressive mountains/ landscapes/ immersed in nature; being next to a body of water where you can catch the Sun's rays bouncing off the ripples and waves and also hearing their sounds; being sat next to an open window with torrential rain pouring down outside; noticing light rays shining through tree leaves; eating amazing food; going to gigs of my favourite artists; looking at cute things (plushies really get to me on a deeper level o.o), etc. 

This is just a small list, but all these things literally create a high in my brain. I feel a rush of seratonin/oxytocin/dopamine (whichever the technical term is) in my brain and my chest swells and feels so uplifted. It's such an incredible feeling; legit inexplicable joy. 

So I'm curious, do you guys experience this feeling also? If so, what drives it?",1565999384

isfp,"My INFJ mother-in-law told me earlier this week she would come over and babysit for us alongside my sister-in-law (her daughter) while my husband and I went to dinner with some elderly neighbors. To be clear, we were supposed to be driving these people and that‚Äôs always the arrangement when we go, so they always call to confirm a couple of days ahead of time to make sure we‚Äôre still on for the dinner date.

Long story, but my mother-in-law, exercising her Fe to its fullest extent, decides that my husband and I should cancel our plans. She tells me so, and gives me her reasoning, then says she will not be coming over after all.

Since I didn‚Äôt see any real reason to cancel the plans, and since our plans never hinged upon her in the first place (the sister-in-law had agreed to this arrangement several days before her mom decided to tag along), her refusing to come over did not compel me to cancel on our neighbors. I just shrugged it off and forgot about it.

The next thing I know, my sister-in-law texts TWO HOURS BEFORE WE ARE SUPPOSED TO PICK THE NEIGHBORS UP to tell us she cannot come babysit. Left is with no options and no window of time within which to find another babysitter. She said her mother had called her and gave her the same reasoning she gave me.

In other words, the INFJ wasn‚Äôt content to passive aggressively suggest I shouldn‚Äôt go by refusing to come over herself, she had to sabotage the entire date and ruin our neighbors night (and she was well aware of the situation) by making it a point to call my sister-in-law and convince her not to babysit for us.

This comes one day after the INFJ mother-in-law accidentally sent me a text meant for someone else, in which she made a rude remark about me. It wasn‚Äôt terribly rude, but it was definitely something she wouldn‚Äôt say to my face and I know she was mortified when she realized she sent it to me instead. 

I used to like INFJs, particularly her, a lot but the more I‚Äôm exposed to her the more she reminds me of my ENFJ mom and every other Fe user I have major problems with.

isfp,"[MBTITypeMe was inconclusive between a few types](https://www.reddit.com/r/MbtiTypeMe/comments/co7jp8/please_type_me_im_so_confused/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app) so I'm trying to find input to see which one fits better :-)

**1) What do you yearn for in life? Why?**

I really just want to have the freedom to live the way I want. If I want to sit on the computer and look at memes until 3am then I'm free to do so, if I want to eat out and eat junk food then I'm free to do so, etc. Large commitment like marriage and having kids and stuff like that makes me extremely uncomfortable and even a bit pissed thinking about it because you can't do anything or hang out with your friends because you're constantly cleaning and fighting and changing diapers etc. I want to be able to get involved in activites and community revolving around my interests and I'll end up skating around anything and everything that prevents me from doing that

**2) Think about a time where you felt like you were at your finest. Tell us what made you feel that way.**

I felt on top of the world when everything seems to be going right, all my favorite online communities are alive, my grades are fine, I'm on my parents' good side and we go out a lot, nobody is 'on my case' and trying to monitor everything I do, my friends invite me out, and I have events to look forward in the coming days. I feel happy when it's like that because I can enjoy myself and not have to worry about anything and have something to look forward to as well. It's a really happy feeling.

**3) What makes you feel inferior?**

When I try to speak up in a group of people and they all just stare at me stoicly and show this contempt that gives off this ""f you"" vibe. This happens especially with random adults that I try to talk to since I'm young. Or when I say something or do something and someone yells a varient of ""who do you think you are"" or ""who do you think you're talking to"" that makes me feel very small too. 

**4) What tends to weigh on your decisions? (Do you think about people, pro-cons, how you feel about it, etc.)**

It depends.. if I'm choosing a short term thing like maybe an area to hang out at, I would probably base it off of ""hey the vending machine actually works there"" or ""yeah that other place has a lot of mesquitos"" or ""they have faster wifi"" etc. But if it's a long term thing like a college, I'd choose based on what they have available, what kind of people I would make friends with there, how close it is to the city, and am I going to be able to do the things I love there etc. 

**5) When working on a project what is normally your emphasis? Do you like to have control of the outcome?**

If it's a school project 99% of the time I'm not even going to want to do it lol. So I'd probably procrastinate a lot and then when I finally start doing it I'll put a lot of emphasis on what's required of me and the specific instructions and what I need to do to not fail and get that done as fast as possible and then if I'm actually remotely interested in it I'll go back and add more quality. If it's a group project, I just sit my booty on my phone until someone tells me what I need to do to contribute and help out and I'll do that and then be done lol. 

**6) Describe us a time where you had a lot of fun. How is your memory of it?**

I went to a large dinner with like 30+ people and I had some margaritas and took a lot of pictures, ordered a ton of desserts, told stories and laughed a lot and those 5-6 hours only felt like a few minutes to me because one funny/cool thing after another kept happening and it was like a non-stop stream of awesomeness and I never wanted to leave. I still remember it very well since it was an extremely significant event in my life. It changed my perspective a lot, it gave me a lot of faith in humanity and showed me that holy crap I didn't know people could be this nice and fun.

**7) When you want to learn something new, what feels more natural for you? (Are you more prone to be hands on, to theorize, to memorize, etc)**

It really depends what I'm learning. If im learning how to cook a meal I remember it better if I watch someone do it in front of me or do it myself. But if I'm learning something like the world maps, I tend to link the country names to something important to me (my friend was from X so now I'll never forget where it is on the map). If im learning how to use a new software then I'll start trying to find the basic features (how do I save? how do I set my profile picture? can I see my friends list?) and then familiarize myself like that. It reaaaaally depends though and I don't learn everything exclusively with one style

**9) How organized do you to think of yourself as?**

I only organize the things that matter to me I've noticed. Like, my locker can look like a landfill and my clothing drawer has no system to it whatsoever, but I also have folders and discord servers and photo albums that I've spend hours designing and making it organized so I can find everything in 1 second and it looks satisfying. But I can only find the energy to do that if its especially personally relevant. Everything else is a tornado

**10) How do you judge new ideas? You try to understand the principles behind it to see if they make sense or do you look for information that supports it?**

I think I tend to figure out how it works first?  like for MBTI I went straight to ok what do these letters stand for, what do they indicate, how do you decode the letters into a cognitive function stack, what do the cognitive functions stands for, how does this add up with me, etc. I really have no idea (I spent like 45 minutes on this question lol üòÇ)

**11) You find harmony by making sure everyone is doing fine and belonging to a given group or by making sure that you follow what you believe and being yourself?**

I think I definitely feel more at peace with the latter, I don't think I really pay attention to if everyone in the group is feeling fine and even if I did notice I wouldn't have the slightest idea what to do :/. On the other hand I feel very at ease when I'm allowed to express my excitement about an interest or a value and if I'm being critised or pushed down for it I consider that to be 0% harmony

**12) Are you the kind that thinks before speaking or do you speak before thinking? Do you prefer one-on-one communication or group discussions?**

I'm absolutely a speak-before-think person. To this day I still get dirty looks after blurting something out and regret it. It's a big issue since my childhood and I barely think things through and I've gotten screwed over many times. As for discussions I find groups to be a ton more fun, I feel like I'm not wasting my time when I speak (((assuming they're listening, and assuming the group didn't just break up and start a bunch of one-on-one micro convos))). And when my mind goes blank, I can rely on other people to prevent the awkward silence, and generally I feel more excited to speak up. Whereas one-on-one can be beneficial depending on the topic or if it's really personal or something, I just think it would be kind of stale if I had the choice between that or the group.

**13) Do you jump into action right away or do you like to know where are you jumping before leaping? Does action speaks more than words?**

This was a tough one for me and I actually had to ask a good friend who knew me very well about this lol. They said I'm definitely more of a leap first person and I don't do much thinking but this could very well just be my age. I'm p young. Also I think words can have a lot of meaning, I know that when I screw up I write apology essays and I know if someone writes one for me, I'll definitely acknowledge it and be touched by it. Actions are important too, I try to make sure I don't contradict my words but when I do and then the other person loses trust in me I dont blame them. They both have weight but just for different purposes. 

**14) It's Saturday. You're at home, and your favourite show is about to start. Your friends call you for a night out. What will you do?**

This actually happened to me the other week lol!!! I was about to binge watch the office with a bowl of cheese balls when my friend called and wanted to go shopping. I was extremely hyped and jumped right out my chair to go meet them. There's no way I'm turning down an invitation to go out. Netflix is always there for me later

**15) How do you act when you're stressed out?**

When something bad is *actively* happening, for example my parents going through my web history or going through my room, during that kind of stress, my stomach physically feels sick and I really just start shutting down yet feel jerked awake at the same time. I can't do anything so I just stand there, actually physically shaking, feeling helpless because there's nothing I can do, and I start thinking bad things like ""Did I forget to clean my history?? They are going to find my X account, and then they're gonna dig around in my email and force the password out of me and go on a tangent and then find everything I've worked for and take it away from me and I'm not going to have a phone or Internet connection ever again and I have to buy a computer in secret somehow and run away and I'll be living life against my own family just to get my crap back"" and just go down that rabbit hole and start thinking what can I do to get out and if I can't get out I'll feel hopelessly trapped. All this turmoil and on the outside I'm simply unmoving, sweating, and have a straight face

**16) What makes you dislike the personalities of some people?**

I really really hate it when people are aloof and judgemental and indifferent especially when I'm being really excited about something or just simply trying to talk to them. I've met people who give off the impression of a snobby cult leader, and every word just seems to be going up their ass and it's a waste of time to talk to them. It's the kind of vibe that would make you feel like saying ""F*** YOU TOO"" even if they didn't say anything. Their body language and responses say it well enough. So stoic and stand offish.

**17) Is there anything you really like talking about with other people?**

I looooooooove talking about funny stories with people. Like I'll tell them about the time I sprayed some random crap and ruined the wall as a child and they'd tell me about another story about their experience or what they did as a child too. Just laughing at situations that weren't funny at the time haha. I also like talking about things that I'm interested in, like cats and what my cat does and what theirs does etc. If Im lucky I'll find someone who heard about MBTI but they're rare and they usually don't even remember their letters 

**18) What kind of things do you pay the least attention to in your life?**

I don't pay attention to how I'm pervievd by others. This applies in a lot of ways. I don't care about my appearance, if I want to wear a T shirt and jeans they are comfortable for me and I don't care if I'm looking formal or impressing anyone. Of course I take care of my hygiene and don't want to smell bad but honestly I'm not a big fasionita either. I also shout blunt stuff sometimes like if someone hands me their business card I was like ""OH this is the company that screwed me over!!"" and then they're kind of offended. Also little things like dropping the entire spoon into the soup bowl and not noticing that the next person has to dig it out etc. I'm kind of a jack ass like that but I'm working on it

**19) How do your friends perceive you? What is wrong about their perception? What would your friends never say about your personality?**

A couple of my friends have said that I was very quiet at first, but then I started being talkative later. I think I was quiet mostly because my parents were closely watching and I was scared to get in trouble or say something that would get me screwed, or because I was face-in-phone and really absorbed in what I'm doing. Another group of friends see me as very vulgar because when there's absolutely no boundaries I start making really dirty jokes lol. One of my friends commented that I see the beauty in everything. Another friend sees me as polite and give more than I take. And my parents see me as outgoing, aware of my surroundings to an extent, and sometimes inappropriate and imposing and interrupt a lot. Somebody called me a lazy sloth too lol. It seems like the different people have different perceptions. But they all never seem to describe me as thoughtful or reserved or authoritian or anything like that.  

Edit: I asked around some more and people said that I was idealistic (like for example I go to an extremely crappy restaurant and somehow still think it's awesome even when it was obviously dirty and customer service was poor lmao)

**20) You got a whole day to do whatever you like. What kind of activities do you feel like doing?**

I would probably go downtown and eat out and sit on a coffee shop's wifi to chat on reddit or something and browse memes, or spend time with my friends and buy a bunch of junk food that I can never finish and use my phone a lot. It depends lol",1565716537

I have big dreams and some of those include him now. But I feel like I will never get to know him on the inside. The things he does on the outside is everything I could ever want. I love him.

But when I ask about his hopes, fears, and dreams, he shares nothing and changes the topic.

He shows his love in thoughtful ways. And while I'm not upset, I feel concerned that I'll never feel full connected.

He shows that he loves me, but going on a year, he has never said it although I do regularly. The topic came up and he said ""it just feels like a lot to say."" I think it is worthy to note that the girl he dated for 4 years before dating me, randomly ended it with him and started dating someone else.

I dare say the biggest reason for that is because I've been 'broken' type (and as you well know, try to _self_ type yourself when you're lost and confused, good luck), definitely Fi-Ni looping, past years not even on the right track and dropping things that I loved, not being allowed to pursue art or passions in general when I was a kid #thxISTJparent, ... yada yada

I actually got mostly typed by tests as an INTJ (which I stereotypically sorta behaved like on the outside, unhappy) or INTP (which I stereotypically behaved like on the outside, at my worst), but I knew it didn't quite sit but y'know, sometimes you just give yourself a few years to (re)grow (lol) and try again. \o/

I blame this dude's video for it (his way of explaining just makes the most sense to me out of all things I've tried to digest), I mostly just watched his vids on the types I was indecisive about and it affirmed me. https://youtu.be/ntcBulfl_IY So yeah, thank you Mr. Joseph (and my attention to stick to it for 30 mins x amount of other videos, oh dear).

It's funny though I never realistically considered being an ISFP (which _is_ stereotypically an artsy type) while I've always been an artsy type. Can I just blame my old friends for linking me too much of a Bob Ross? ""Yeah, not me."" /jk

isfp,"I‚Äôm an INFP but I pretty much lurk on every MBTI subreddit bc i like hearing about how ppl see the world differently :) I also unsubscribes from the INFP subreddit bc I didn‚Äôt like most of the stuff on there. 

I know this isn‚Äôt logical and it‚Äôs basically self pity but I really admire you guys and wish I was more like you. I know three ISFPs in real life and there‚Äôs also SZA the musician who‚Äôs soooooo amazing and also an ISFP. You guys are practical, down-to-earth, and more action oriented people. You care a lot for aesthetics too. Se seems really cool and foreign to me. I would give up Ne for literally three dollars to be honest. The only thing that worries me about Se is that I‚Äôve seen the negative side of it in other people like eating disorders, risky sexual behavior, poor spending habits, etc. 

I just think it would be cool to be closer to real life even though I don‚Äôt find real life all that interesting? Like it‚Äôd be cool to be more in touch with the physical aspect of life. I remember once a book lover was talking about how they love the smell of books and even though I‚Äôm a big reader too, i had absolutely no idea what a book smells like???? I‚Äôm also so uncoordinated and spatially unaware and uncomfortable in my own body and oblivious to the sensory world. As you can probably tell, I kind of hate being an N.

As you can see, I‚Äôm pretending to be happy for you when in reality I just wish I was you. It‚Äôs stupid to wish to have other people‚Äôs problems but it‚Äôs very late as I‚Äôm writing this and I needed to get this out.

I immediately felt my heart sink, as I began to realize I had halfway expected her to be busy or not want to go (she‚Äôs ISFP too, and flakes constantly in favor of staying home.) In fact, I realized, *I* don‚Äôt even want to go. What in the fuck was I thinking?

 I want to get into it again and feel like maybe someone here has had a similar experience with taking time away from it. I am just really inexperienced and find it kind of overwhelming, especially on apps where everyone has such nice pictures of themselves. I noticed today that I'm starting to become a bit of a recluse, and I'm very unhappy with that. I don't have many friends where I live(just moved here) but I'm thinking I could try finding some groups or something. 

Kind of just a late night thought I'm having. Today was a weird day in that I just stayed inside, but I'm starting to realize that I would be better off just going for really long walks, at least I'd be experiencing the outdoors. I guess I'm also realizing that if I wait too long I'll be like 30 without very much relationship experience. It already feels weird and I need to just try or else it'll never happen.

isfp,"Alright, so ISFP here. I have a terrible time with moving past arguments, because I get caught up in an Fi-Ni issue. It tends go like this;  


Me - \*Says something\*  


Other Person - \*Disagrees/misunderstands me, whatever\*  


Me - \*Gets irritated/offended\* 

&amp;#x200B;

(If the disagreement is on something I feel very strongly about, like it's a subject of personal morality, yeah I'm going to get a little upset. I also hate misunderstandings, or people making assumptions about things like my intentions, or thoughts.)

&amp;#x200B;

Then after the argument my mind is all; ""Welp...that was a good friendship while it lasted. Too bad they hate you now, for daring to be anything other than perfect.""  


And that creates tension. After I argue just once with someone, there is a sense of tension in the air, where I'm about 90 percent certain they despise the ground I walk on. 

&amp;#x200B;

I had an argument with an ENFP once, before that we got along alright. Then it was like everything he did started to tick me off. It felt like he was just trying to pick a fight with me. To be fair this particular ENFP is very stubborn, doesn't shy away from conflict, and gets really aggressive when he's arguing. 

&amp;#x200B;

But in general though I don't like ""slipping"". I need to have a sort of image of someone who never gets bothered by anything, so when I do get whiny, or angry, and show people that side of myself, I feel immense guilt. I've broken my facade, and shown that I'm not perfect. And therefore if I go back to my usual peaceful self, they're going to think it's fake...  


And it's not. My usual self really is laid-back, peaceful, unassuming, it's just after I show people that I do have a darker side, I feel like they'll think the whiny, raging, insecure me is the ""real"" one, and the calm, peaceful, me is just an act.

isfp,"I first discovered the MBTI around 6 months ago. I took the test and got ""ISTJ"". I thought to myself that it was kind of fitting, but some things stood out as simply ""definitely not me"". 

I tried looking at all the other types, all the functions, but instantly dismissed the ISFP without genuinely looking into it, because I thought ""wait, me, an artist?"" No fucking way. I can't draw.

And that's where I was wrong.

**ISFPs and the search for beauty**

You know what was the first activity at elementary school that I wanted to do? I wanted to draw. Unfortunately, my art teacher was a person who used to mistreat the children and I quit it, because I couldn't handle poor behavior directed at me. 

**Genuine Empathy**

We are truly empathetic. We care about other people. How often have I been the sponge that has to absorb all the negativity of the people around me? Way too many times. How many of you start feeling anxiety and physical sensations while listening to something that is truly frightening or moving?

I genuinely feel bad if I hurt somebody. It doesn't matter whether it's a family member, a pet or even a random passerby. I want everyone to be treated properly.

**The Awareness Of The World**

We are great at catching details, imitating others, utilizing our senses. A lot of us have a knack for sports, playing music, using practical tools, technology and other various equipment. 

We enjoy being part of this world: the amazing taste of the food, the outdoors activities, the music, the sights, the smells. Everything fascinates us. 

Despite being introverts, we often tend to seek social activities and I think being a somewhat extroverted introvert is a great way to experience life.

**The Artists, But Not Exactly**

The most headscratching thing about the type for me, personally, was the fact that it's often labeled as the artist. I initially thought I wasn't one, but then thought about it deeper.

I enjoy playing music and singing, I love fashion, my presentations are always ""fresh"" and ""captivating"", I enjoy being a host during events and rarely ever follow the script, it's mostly improvization and people love it. I like collecting interesting items, both expensive and not so much.

What is more, sometimes I write stories, but I need to be inspired by someone else's creations first. I rarely ever come up with an entirely new thing. I have a tendency to improve what is already here and make it either more practical or aesthethically pleasing. For instance, I tend to re-write popular songs(both music and lyrics) to fit the vibes that I'm feeling on a certain day.

Which part of this is not technically **artistic**? I think we have to look at this word from many different point of views.

**The Bad**

The worst thing about us is that we're extremely critical of ourselves and need other people's validation.

We often dislike being constrained by schedules and various limitations, but we have a more ""with the flow"" attitude and have a tendency to improvize well on the spot. 

Potentially hard to befriend if we're in our ""quiet and reserved"" mode. But start shining a beautiful and bright blue aura if we hit it off with someone.

Finalizing decisions is one thing that is personally hard for me to do. I'm often not sure how I feel about certain things. For instance, choosing a career, picking my outfit for the day. 

Even a dumb thing like ""should I get this yoghurt which has more proteins and tastes average or the one that has less proteins, but tastes decent"" can stress me out sometimes. Which leads us to our inability to properly deal with stress. It's especially tiring since we imagine that other people have already figured everything out and we're being left behind, whereas we're often times ahead and have our shit together, but don't know it.

I could write so much more about us, but I think I've told you enough about this amazing type of ours.",1564779614

I confronted him by text, which is difficult because we were raised Catholic and repress everything accordingly. Anyhoo, I am instigating all conversations and its driving me crazy that all we talk about is basketball or his scientific field (malaria -- field research PhD). He was not intellectual growing up and didn't read much (maybe some of those paperback lawyer novels) so I assailed him for being a dumb jock a lot when I was young (though we played sports together a lot) and he ignored me as I hit puberty and dismissed me as being just ""an asshole"" when I apologized strategically  last year in an effort to rebuild the relationship so that's why I've strived (strove?) to talk about mutual interests like above (bugs, basketball, though i wouldn't say they are mutual interests as much as I am racking my brain for what I find curious about each to ask him). 

Just frustrating wanting him to be there to talk about daily life stuff, issues, be a part of my life. He said in a defeatist way in a text that he is just ""not  good"" at communicating emotions, and doesn't seem to be making any effort. But I think he does care about me just doesn't know how to show it (which is why no INFJ doorslam) Recently he said he is too busy to talk much, and I said what he uses his spare time on shows his priorities in life.

I'm facing the same struggle, though it's actually between enfp, infp or isfp (laughably, the 72archetypes guy told me I am an ENTJ, aka Time Lord--anyone remember him?). At any rate, I'm definitely a Fi user.

I am absolutely capable of writing a huge novel about myself in hopes of being typed, and have done so on other subs, but I'm trying to keep this shorter, so I'm copy/pasting in a response I made to a ""type me"" thread that never got answered (I've paraphrased the questions because I can't find that thread anymore). I'm wondering if I fit ISFP both in terms of content and writing style (FWIW, I write professionally, but in a freelance communications context, not a literary one). And...as I'm writing this I'm seeing ALL the parentheses and thinking that might be a whole lotta Ne, lol.

**How to you feel about socializing and being part of a social group?**

This is an area I struggle with. I like socializing. I always feel better after I've spent some time with another person or had a conversation with anyone--stranger, friend, anyone. BUT I spend a lot of time alone because I work from home and that's unfortunate because when I'm alone I brood and feel anxious. I'm also married to an extreme introvert and I have allowed his reticence to do social things on the spur of the moment to take precedence, causing me miss out on many social activities over the years. Over the years we've lost couple/family friends to moves away and now we're down to like two other families and it sucks. I want us to have more friends, be invited to things, but I have to do all the work there and then force him to go or just go by myself/with the kids. All of that said, I easily get bored of people that I socialize with, especially if they only talk about superficial things. ""Mom groups"" were both necessary and totally boring to me for this reason when my kids were little. I'm a really terrible group member in general. I have joined lots of groups in my life (sorority in college, churches, social groups, etc.,) and then slowly faded out of them all when I invariably realized that I don't like having a group identity and don't value/won't respect the group's traditions, values, etc. I WANT to belong but REFUSE to. :)

**How do you make decisions, and what life decisions are you proud of?**

I honestly don't know that I've made that many truly monumental decisions, or at least they don't seem that way to me. Deciding to travel to live in a foreign country with some friends right after college and then deciding to break away from the group and do my own thing for a more ""authentic"" experience--that was a ballsy move that I'm still proud of because it affected the course of my life in many ways. The others would I guess be deciding to get married, deciding to have babies, because these decisions obviously wrought big changes. But in terms of career, no big decisions there, and I'm kind of ashamed of that fact. I just stuck with the first career path I fell into out of college because I'm good at it, but I don't actually like it. But it's flexible and I can be home with my kids, so...

**What kinds of things are you passionate about/do you enjoy?**

I love my kids fiercely and take a lot of joy in watching my them grow into amazingly smart, quirky, strong-willed little people (but I dislike kids in general, lol, especially little ones because they are snotty and disgusting, ha ha). I enjoy exploring new places or revisiting places that I like but haven't been to in a while. My ideal weekend would be just hopping in the car and driving north, south, east or west and seeing what cool towns we can find. But of course, this can't happen because my husband is not at all on this wavelength (he's very responsible and just likes to chill at home) and it's difficult with kids at the ages our kids are. Maybe when they're older. But yeah, I definitely like exploring new places, nothing too out there or unusual, just new towns, farmer's markets, museums, that kind of thing. I love walking and hiking and taking in the physical beauty of nature. I DO NOT enjoy loud, crowded places engineered to ""make you have fun,"" aka theme parks, water parks, concerts, Disneyland (shudder), Las Vegas (barf, barf, barf). I like quieter, authentic places. I also like learning random scientific/medical facts and happenings. Ha ha.

**What is your purpose in life?**

Hmm. I suppose I want to live a gentle life where I remember to slow down and enjoy it while also not only accepting surface-level perceptions as true reality, if that makes sense (I think this must be a war between my N and S). I suppose I do see love, charity, kindness as the primary purpose of our existence, even if I am not always very good about enacting these ideals. These ideals are the only thing separating us from the brutal world of natural selection/animals, and I really don't want to be ""just an animal.""

Maybe there is a complicated answer to this question or maybe it's not possible - you just have to sacrifice some peace of mind to be prepared. I feel happier living in the moment and making spontaneous decisions, but it's important to plan in life to make things easier for yourself. Logically, I get that planning is a very helpful mental exercise to meet your goals and meeting goals feels good! It's so ironic - I could make a series of decisions spontaneously and feel like the happiest person but if I made the same series of decisions according to a plan, I would feel trapped.

Do you relate? Have you been able to plan and still be able to live in the moment without a lot of guilt/anxiety?

One second I think ""wait no I'm definitely INFP"", the next I've determined that no, I was wrong, I'm ISFP after all... I finally decided to make an account and ask the dang thing myself (always a last resort hahaha), in the hopes that maybe my language or something might be an utter giveaway to someone more knowledgeable than me. Because it truly feels I'm in the middle? I've researched cognitive functions a bit but I'm still so confused, it all seems very vague with lots of contradicting anecdotes-- and I identify with BOTH most of the time, especially in those ""INFP vs ISFP"" posts that are supposed to give differences. I need concrete examples to understand and identify with but when they're contradictory it's impossible to ""get"".

So I've been on and off obsessing over months before I broke down and decided to ask someone. 

I had a bunch of things I'd planned to say but now it's gone, as usual when I start writing anything I've been planning a while. I guess something that definitely gums up the works is I'm probably not the most healthy person mentally. I tend to hide from people. Its been over a year since I've properly gone anywhere, even the store. Taking the trash out is as social as I get. But such is a problem for another forum. 

I've noticed in the INFP forum the front page is usually a lot more full of pictures, which I like as I'm an artist and visual person, but I can't usually identify with the comments on said pictures. My first thought upon seeing a beautiful picture are to figure out things like composition, value structure, and color scheme, all of things I'm trying to improve on as an artist. So this lends me to believe I'm an ISFP.

But then, then I read about how ISFPs are supposed to be graceful and very in tune to the world whereas our less physically inclined friends the INFPs tend to be clumsy and I think I cannot be an ISFP, I've never been graceful a day in my life, I've been positively klutzy my entire life. Dancing? No. I feel like a stranger in my body, a newly born calf among gazelles Very awkward.

Part of the problem is I want to be an ISFP, for reasons that are entirely alien to me. So in the interest of not skewing my results, I attempt to objectively think about both sides and that turns into a rapid vacillation of identifying alternately with both.

This will be long so thank you if you‚Äôll read it. Also, English isn‚Äôt my first language so sorry for my bad grammar.

Basically, I met this ISFP guy in a random chat like one week ago. We talked for about six hours straight, he was really funny and interesting and asked for my number so we could continue to chat on our phones. So, when we start to chat on our phones, he sees my profile picture and comes up with a lot of flirty jokes about how much he‚Äôs attracted to me. When we are telling each other goodnight, I tell him (jokingly, but not really) that he should text me first later cause I‚Äôm afraid of bothering people, but he told me that i could bother him whenever i wanted, always flirting. 
The next day, I really wanted to talk to him but he didn‚Äôt text me, so I just... didüòÇ
 He wasn‚Äôt flirty at all, and I had to start every conversation we had (same as every conversation we had ever), always making questions which he answered shortly without asking my point of view; the same thing happened the day after, and after. I asked him why he was acting this way (being subtle as always) and he told me he just really likes mangas and I might not be too interested in those.

 I‚Äôve been getting a lot of anxiety because he really doesn‚Äôt sound interested in our conversation and I always feel like I‚Äôm bothering him. I told him that and he told me that he would tell me if I did bother him, but continued with the ‚Äúyes‚Äù and ‚Äúnope‚Äù replies. Today I didn‚Äôt text him because I‚Äôm afraid of coming off as clingy or needy. 

So here are the questions:

isfp,"I'm really sorry for the long post but i just need to find answers now more than ever.

I've always had this feeling of being detached from others. As in, I lack empathy for many people around me but not in the way that I run with logic instead of how I feel. As in, I sometimes feel detached and like I'm not fully in touch with reality. When i was younger this happened a lot more and i could be very cold and insensitive, because I just felt numb a lot and i didnt care about how anyone felt. I could be very envious and I often acted upon it, trying to always get my own way and getting very upset if I didnt. I made my friends friend cry by leaving them out and I was always attention seeking by making myself moody and sad.

I often felt left out because others saw me as being annoying or too moody. Also I've never been able to make proper connections with others!!! Which sucks!! I have friends, but I've never been able to properly form connections with them. If they got up and left me now, I would just be like ""well, whatever."" I've always wanted to make friends but I've never been able to fully get to the proper deep stage of connection. With my family I do have connections though, and it goes very deep with my Mom and I. I've always been very independent and stubborn, wanting to do things my way. I've never had the mindset to blame myself for anything, I tend to put it on others or situations that I've been in, which is good for my mental health but not so good for those around me... 

I've changed a lot from when I was younger but it's been hard. I hide how I feel a lot now and I tend to put on a mask that I care more than I actually do because I know now that being that selfish when I was younger didnt help my relationships at all. It makes me happier being nicer to others anyway and it makes me feel accepted.

isfp,"I'm pretty fond of ISTPs myself, my dad's one, for starters. They're nice to be around, fun to talk to and do stuff together with and they're really helpful. A lot of times when I encounter ISTPs conversations seem to flow pretty natural, and they usually appreciate what I have to say and enjoy my jokes.

ISTP women are usually really attractive as well.

The only thing I kind of struggle with is how their mood seems to fluctuate a lot. Like, sometimes they seem a bit grumpy and they just ""uh-huh"" you when you talk to them, and like an hour later they're suddenly really outgoing and you're like ""uh, what?"".",1563989515
isfp,"I‚Äôve been with my boyfriend for a little over a year and we‚Äôve been friends for a total of 5 years (we work for the same company). No surprise, we often times have communication breakdowns and on top of that are pretty opposite in every way; personally I like that. It makes me see things and feel things differently. 

Please share your thoughts on this specific situation as it‚Äôs similar but different to issues in the past. I leave for a short stint of travel for work and will be gone tomorrow morning and will be getting home late Friday. Normally our date nights are Thursday‚Äôs so we switched date night to Monday (yesterday). No biggie. Tonight I had a mutual work friend over for dinner as she was going through a tough time (trying to act on empathy since it‚Äôs not my strong suit). 

BF texts that he just finished up a run and I asked if he would like to join us. He‚Äôs says no, he wasn‚Äôt feeling the greatest from the heat. I say ok I hope you feel better. Half hour later, he texts says he‚Äôs feeling better and that he‚Äôs meeting up with other mutual coworker friends for drinks around the corner. I felt slighted at this and after a few more catch up from the day texts, ask if he was gonna come by and see me before I left. That triggered him. 

On a normal day, I probably wouldn‚Äôt have cared that much, but with leaving tomorrow I expressed that it just made me feel hurt that I got a no and our other friends got a yes. This quickly escalated into him saying that now he feels like shit and I said that just to make him mad and he hates how direct I am, that he‚Äôs just be a horrible person and it was over something so stupid he wouldn‚Äôt have even brought it up. 

I don‚Äôt do well not expressing how I feel and if I were to sit and wait, I would have prob gotten angry as I have the time to severely over analyze things. I wasn‚Äôt at the time and wasn‚Äôt looking for him to drop what he was doing or anything, just expressing that it made me feel crappy. 

I do go to counseling as a catalyst to help improve myself, especially where my blind spots are and it is hard. It isn‚Äôt natural but I sincerely try. And as a cold hearted INTJ, honestly the last thing I want is to make the person I care about the most feel bad, though I seem to be pretty good at it. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair to ask me to suppress how something made me feel though and I expect and encourage him to make sure he tells me if anything I‚Äôm doing is rubbing him the wrong way. It just seems that if it‚Äôs something he does that makes me feel bad or sad (it really takes a lot to get me angry), he jumps to getting pissed, basically blaming himself and assuming because it‚Äôs something HE did to make me feel that way, he feels like a horrible person üòû",1563933282
isfp,"So I‚Äôve found lately that I‚Äôve been getting frustrated by projects that I have been working on but only able to devout a little bit of time here and there to.

ISFPs are usually very in the moment, right? I think I do much better when I can be in the moment, absorbed, obsessed, and focus on one project until it is completed. 

I find when I do it little by little I spend the majority of time each session trying to get back up to speed and then just as I‚Äôm hitting my stride I have other responsibilities come in and I set the project aside.

isfp,"Hey, guys! Somebody suggested I‚Äôm ISFP (all along I thought I was INTP or INFP) and I thought I‚Äôd see what you guys think. Could I actually be ISFP? 

I'm a 22 year old male. Around trusted friends, I'm goofy yet discerning, thoughtful and enthusiastic, interested in discussions and activities that center around peaceful and relaxing experiences. Around acquaintances, I might come off as formal, concerned with leaving a positive impression and appearing competent, grounded and open-minded. I am passionate about music and style. I love nature, serenity, feelings of harmony between myself and my physical and social environment, and developing myself into a better man. But I still find that I am too full of contradictions. Analyzing myself causes me to feel anxiety.

I like to see myself as a nature person. I love to be in the woods, just wandering, listening to music. But I also can be somewhat of a homebody. All in all, I like activities that are free from stress and pressure, and can teach me about new things or things I'm already interested in. I do have an adventurous streak, and sometimes enjoy immersing myself in a crowd.

I am quietly artistic. I like to draw people, objects, buildings, logos, etc. I also really enjoy painting. I love poetry and writing above all. I don't think I'm that great at art, but I enjoy the feeling of creating. I also don't like to show my art to just anybody. I have to be sure that they won‚Äôt laugh at me.

I am past and future oriented--I place great trust in the future, particularly my ability to eventually work things out, to apply myself and actualize myself in a future role of my own creation. I look forward to the wisdom I will gain from the passing of time. The present is no fun, but I have learned to stay involved and on-the-ball when it comes to practical matters. I enjoy making to-do lists, and challenging myself to maintain a schedule (i.e., wake up early). I am not even close to being consistent in this way, but I am working toward my goal of being more present-oriented.

I like to go on Wikipedia, I love to listen to music by myself or with close friends just at the right moment (the other day, I was happy to see my friends like the song I picked to watch the moonrise with). I like skateboarding, bicycling, making coffee, reading, playing soccer, learning languages, building things, military history, fashion, etc.

I am a visual learner, and I also need specific, concrete examples to understand something new. Logic appeals to me, but I am horrible at math. I am much more humanities-oriented by nature.

I aspire to make the world a slightly better place, contributing something of value to the people around me and in my field, being part of some movement for progress, being financially stable and having a constructive understanding and acceptance of myself. Being able to be fully there for people who trust and rely on me. Being a role model for my future children. Being someone I‚Äôm proud of.

At my best, I am confident, feeling in control of myself, applying my knowledge to the work I'm doing, feeling like what I'm doing is constructive and important, taking care of my body and health, positive interactions with friends.

At my worst, I am anxious, avoidant, bitter, cut-off from my friends and family, self-destructive, feeling inadequate or fradulent, out of control, letting my health deteriorate, thought loops, dark humor.",1563575354
isfp,"Recently realized a character flaw and wondering if any other ISFP‚Äôs relate. 

No matter the setting or scenario I feel the need to be unforgettable. In relationships I‚Äôll be the one to initiate the breakup, but if my ex doesn‚Äôt chase me then I feel like I‚Äôm the one that lost out (even though I‚Äôm usually better off.) I recently resigned from a job and my bosses basically begged me to stay and I felt a great sense of power from that. I still left the job and felt great about it but if I resigned and they had acted indifferent I probably would have regretted quitting. 

Those are just a few examples but I‚Äôm literally like that in all aspects of my life. I know I can‚Äôt be ‚Äúthe one that got away‚Äù in every situation and I‚Äôm honestly getting sick of having this mindset. Any ISFP‚Äôs struggled with this need for validation and have tips for overcoming it?

One example is a dude at a drama class I went in about a year ago, he was very physically toned, athletic, slim muscles. He also seemed very ""rough"" and sporadic in his movements. Now I don't really mind robotic looking people but it can really bother me when people who are aware of their physical awkwardness try to over-compensate for it by acting like a chimpanzee on steroids. Everyone else seemed to enjoy his physical expression though, because it was somehow exotic to them? To me it seemed too cringy and over-the-top to enjoy it though.

isfp,"There's no one in my friend group or family I really click with and can talk about stuff. It's either I'm listening about the other person's life or talking about some topic which bores me. Some of my friends like to debate which is fine but it can be annoying at once as I find it hard to accept the other person's opinions if it doesnt follow my values.

Here are some types of the people I'm close to and a small summary of how I feel about my friendship with them.

ESFP - Good friends with him however he has a girlfriend so he just basically spends time with her. It can be kinda annoying as whenever he asks me to go out I do but whenever I ask he can't be asked or he's doing things with his girl which is fine I guess. However sometimes I ask him to go out and he says he doesn't want to go just in case his girlfriend will be free that day. I enjoy doing activities such as sports with him however our conversations don't get very interesting.

ENFPs - I've got two of these in my life and they're really good people at heart. Sometimes they can be annoying tho as they talk a lot about pointless things. I heard that a lot of ISFPs really get on well with ENFPs but I guess for me it's different. The ENFPs usually say I'm selfish and it annoys me at times just cause I don't do things they command me to do. I know these two are good people but I don't know they just don't click well with me. They never talk about anything deep or something that really interests me.

ENTP - I get on well with them when I'm in a group as we share a similar type of humour. When I'm alone with them they are pretty cool too. They're good at holding conversations but again the conversations don't go deep much.

INTJ - Met them recently, we clicked pretty well straight away. They live quite from me so I can't really visit them often plus they recently got married so I don't want to take much time from them. I also feel like I find them more interesting than they find me. 

ISTP - They're cool and interesting but I feel like their mood can change quick. Like one day they would be willing to go out and do stuff and the next when I invite them they don't want to go out. Our conversations usually tend to focus on other people around the group and what they're doing however because they don't express their feelings about subjects it can get very boring for me. Also they see things in a black and white way which is annoying. 

ISTJ - Again too black and white and they command me to do things too much. I don't mind helping you but it's annoying when you command me to do things, especially things which you can easily do yourself.

ESTP - This one I probably spoke the most about my feelings with. They listen, give good input and help me. But I could tell they find it annoying so I stopped doing it.

I don't know why but I feel like I don't have anyone in my life currently which I can constantly talk to. I have a lot of friends, these are just some that I spend more time with as I see them more often. Although I have a lot of friends I still feel lonely. I don't know wether it's my fault. I was thinking maybe because most of my friends are either thinkers which have Ti as one of their first two functions and feelers which have Fi as one of their main two functions. Anyone got any advice on how to feel less lonely?",1563430240

isfp,So two years ago I cut off my best friend for being passive aggressive towards me.  I never struggle with creating physical distance between myself and people but I really struggle letting go of people emotionally. Once I let someone into my life then I always envision them being a friend for life which is why it's been so hard for me to move on. Even though I cut this person off I still think of them regularly. I guess I kinda want them in my life just because nobody else has been able to fill the hole they've left behind. I hate feeling like I need someone else to replace them because I shouldn't need other people like this but I feel so lonely and sad sometimes. Any advice on how to move on?? I don't think this is healthy.,1563406532

Being opposites I‚Äôd expect differently, but their outward energy is great for communication, they‚Äôre able to piece things together to form a plan for the day and keep me on track when I probably wouldn‚Äôt do so great at that on my own!

isfp,"They're supposed to be one of our ideal matches.

Personally, I'm not quite sure what to say. I've had some good and bad experiences with ESFJs.

Good ones are extremely friendly and supportive (example, Rock Lee from Naruto), while bad ones seem to delight in being a total douchebag and enjoy tormenting others (honestly, these kind of ESFJs kinda seem like unhealthy ESTPs to me, can barely tell the difference). Example: Malty from Shield Hero.

IRL most ESFJs I've met aren't particularly interesting, they're the stereotypical dumb ones who just do whatever it takes to fit and be liked, didn't like them so much. I also suspect that my uncle is one, and while he's okay overall, he does have a really annoying sense of humor (whenever I'm sitting at the table with him for example, he loves to have awkward conversations with me) so I tend to avoid him.

I've also met a few ESFJs who were really nice to me and were pretty cool people.",1563359571
isfp,,1563355561
isfp,"I guess they aren't all that different-- but when I look at the difference I realize that this was probably the correct personality for me all along. Maybe.

I'm emotional, prefer my alone time, overly prideful and would rather struggle than ask for help. I'm easily hurt by others emotionally and critically even if I don't let it on. Patient, daydreamer and a pro for any kind of change. I can be really spontaneous sometimes, which isn't always a good thing. I tend to buy things I shouldn't and I'll take trips on a whim when I feel extra down on myself. I don't mind crowds as long as it's with a group I enjoy. I love my independence and I would rather never have a roommate again unless I absolutely need to. I can come off confident with my stories but deep down I struggle just like everyone else.

Older brother- INTJ. Can't relax around him, we have completely different views on 'sucesess' which leads to us both seeing eachother as losers.

Hi ISFPs! I am currently doing some research on some MBTI correlatives. I want to see if there's a connection between personality type and political preference + university performance.

isfp,"I've noticed that the reason people find us difficult is because they decide we are.

'Why is this ISFP so indecisive?'
Because we don't have a strong enough opinion to feel the need to effect the outcome.

'Why is this ISFP so distant all of a sudden?'
Because.... We're not involved. We're focused on something more interesting. It most likely has nothing to do with you personally, we will probably think 'I don't enjoy hanging out with this person anymore' not 'I don't like this person anymore'

'Why is this ISFP so secretive?'
Because we don't feel like you have a say in our lifes, why should we tell you something that has nothing to with you? It's fear of being controlled/judged.

If an ISFP actually dislikes you its most likely because you tried to put these lables on us.
Don't make up conspiracies about us and think you know us. 
It will makes us feel controlled and we will find you unauthenic and untrustworthy just for making up these distorted versions of us.

We're the least dishonest people, we don't have a secret agenda, we won't fuck people over, we are just living our lives in peace.

isfp,"**""As an ISFP female, how to not feel ""cheap"" after being more physically  intimate?""**

&gt;Generally a question for other ISFP females, but male opinions and insights are welcome. 

In a nutshell, I am an ISFP (F, mid-20s) been spending more time with someone I'm interested in. The last time we saw one another, things got a bit more physical between us. However, we haven't talked about if we're actually dating yet, so that might be playing into why I am feeling this way.

The moment he left, even though it had been such a great day, a heaviness just swallowed me whole. I felt cheap. My thought process was basically, ""Great, nice job, me. Now he probably thinks he doesn't have to define our relationship we are because he'll assume that things will continue to progress until we have sex or something."" 

The thing is that he seems to be one of the most sincere men I've spent time with. When we're cuddling, he's respectful, funny, makes me feel comfortable, and (ironically) is the one who seems to be keeping the pace. Tbh, pretty sure if he'd asked if he could do certain things I probably would've said yes because I am always too eager to please and am terrible at playing hard to get. 

It just seems like, no matter how much I enjoy being physically intimate WHEN it's happening - AFTERWARDS, I always end up feeling cheap and shitty when he leaves. Like I gave up too much of myself, too soon, too openly, and that he'll just use me and eventually dump me.

**Not sure if it's an ISFP thing, or a female thing.** 

**Just need some advice on what I should tell or remind myself to just stop feeling this way?**   


\--

TLDR; I started being more physically intimate with someone I'm interested in. Not sure if we're officially dating. It's always a great time and he is a sincere guy, but after he leaves, I always end up feeling cheap and shitty. Not sure if it's an ISFP thing, or a female thing - just need some advice on how to not keep feeling this way.",1561734294

isfp," 

* I have fun relating objects with other objects that do not seem to relate. I often relate people to color, or animals, or numbers, or anything else that pops into my head.
* I have a slow and monotonous speech, usually with many pauses because I almost always look for the best word to synthesize what I want to express / explain.
* I think I'm very sentimental about things that I care about, if there's something I'm passionate about, I'm capable of sacrificing myself for that. Despite this I am indifferent to almost everything, rarely anything really touches me, it just happened in my most intimate relationships.
* I do not know if this is related to my worst mental states, but sometimes I become obsessed and hypochondriac with some detail of my body, some fault, defect, sensation and so on. Once a purple spot appeared on my finger, I swore that I had been stung by a brown spider, and I just imagined my arm necrosing to the point of no more. In the end it was nothing. Because of this insecurity from time to time I try to be healthier, but I always fail miserably.
* When I stabilize I end up freaking out because I need new things, it's almost a compulsion. In spite of this I am not very active and even I can stagnate in some way, so much that I spent two years looking for a job because I did not want to work because it seems to be exhausting, however much I knew it was necessary.
* I am the friend who seeks to unite the rest of the group, I almost always call my friends to go out and do something.
* I tend to be very quiet but depending on the people, moment, or humor I am a bag of puns and jokes
* When solving problems I usually appeal to leverage, all this because I'm a lazy son of a bitch.
* I always try to walk well dressed, usually I invest a good part of my money in clothes that I find interesting / comfortable
* I usually think so much about the past that it even became a hobby. I often remember the good times of my childhood, my past relationships and so on.
* I hate it when people think they know more about me than I do.
* My memory is horrible, there are moments that I forget things that just happened.

**1. What drives you in life? What do you look for?**

I do not know exactly if there is something that guides me through life, I see that I have completed many of the things I have always dreamed of (intimate relationships, personal goals and so on), so lately I have only lived one day at a time without a specific goal

**2. What do you hope to accomplish in your life?**

I think the only thing I need to complete is to form a band and go out there doing shows

**3. What do you hope to avoid doing or being? What values are important to you?**

My current state of mind is something I never wanted to be, I want to get out of this present state, I want to get rid of this indifference I have for most of things

**4. What are your biggest fears (not including phobias)? Why?**

Maybe feel alone? Not alone like ""your parents are not at home"", but definitely alone with no one else on your side supporting you.

The irony of all this is that in my normal state I just want to be alone

**5. How do you want others to see you? How do you see yourself?**

Others: intelligent, strong, wise and efficient.

Me: incapable, vulnerable, weak and useless (sounds very depressing but I see it all as a certain indifference)

**6. What makes you feel your best? What makes you feel your worst?**

* Best: When I listen to music, when I discuss interesting subjects, I have fun interactions with others and when I am inspired by something
* Worst: When I feel hypochondriac when I argue with someone important to me and when someone betrays my confidence

**7. Describe how you experience each of: a) anger; b) shame; c) anxiety.**

* Anger) I usually repress because I have always believed that showing anger was tantamount to revealing your weakness, but there are times when I just let it flow.
* Shame) I want to hide in a hole if it is something related to public exposure, but if it is something I did and I feel guilty and ashamed, I seek redemption in some way with the person I hurt
* Anxiety) I do not experience anxiety, the anxiety that experiences me. I get paranoid with everything and everyone, if I go do something I think about 500 times before and etc

**8. Describe how you respond to each of: a) stress; b) unexpected change; c) conflict.**

* Stress) I get pissed off with everything and everyone, I do everything my way and I'm intolerant of mistakes and stupidity
* Unexpected) hug like a friend, always read well with unexpected changes, sometimes I even need it
* Conflict) I do not know how to deal with the conflict, when it happens I can not stop thinking about the reason / person, my head keeps turning like a carousel

**9. Describe your orientation to: a) authority; b) power. How do you respond to these?**

I kill authority and fuck with power

**10. What is your overall outlook on life and humanity?**

A bunch of people who have had family issues and end up trying to restore what they lack through others / the world, creating a cycle of chaos and conflict that will never cease

Even talking up on a stage to an audience of strangers is wayyy less nerve wracking to me than being at a group dinner with coworkers/peers that I'm more familiar with. 
It's like, as soon as I start to figure out THEIR individual personalities, I start getting self-conscious about my own.

isfp,"Hello dear ISFPs.

I recently broke a very fulfilling relationship with an INTP. We're in different stages in our lives and he has goals for himself that require him to move away for a while. Painfully so, he also plans to marry in the next 3 years. I am still studying hence I can't make that leap.

He wants us to remain friends, continue to hang out and talk like we used to, but I feel that will make it impossible for me to move on. Nothing I've said to the contrary has changed his mind. 

When prodding further he told me that he needs me, that I can rely on him for anything and that he considers me to be a friend for life. I am confused as to how to proceed knowing this. Ideally I would be able to move on while remaining friends, but I doubt that will happen.

isfp,"As a kid growing up, I was very athletic. I had an abundance of energy, and while I never did any actual sports I was very good at just being coordinated, quick on my feet stuff like that.

I was really skinny kid.

Then I went through puberty, and while all of my chubby friends got really tall and skinny, I stayes the same height but gained a whole bunch of weight and that really wrecked my confidence.

Even after I got all the weight worked off I still just wasn't really as active as I had been.

Then for some reason whole bunch of crap in my life happened all the same time. I'm not going to go into a rant fest/pity party, but from 14 to 18 my life just sucked. 

As a result of mounting issues I kind of stopped being active all together and the most physical thing I started doing was just like playing video games.

I eat well enough, and exercise at home to stay in good shape, but I just don't really have the confidence anymore to have the kind of natural in the moment, ability I did as a kid.

I feel like the only time my Se comes in handy for me nowadays is while I'm driving. There are a number of times where I have managed to avoid an accident because I have very good reflexes.

What I want though is to get my Se back to its prime level. I want to not only be capable of being active, but having the confidence that my kid self did.

 and i know what his type is, he's an ISFP (bc i asked the third person). then, i really want to know who he is, i asked two of my male friends to guess from the third person's circle of friends. they both had an assumption on this guy, both of them had strong insticnt that this guy is the one who's having a crush on me. so one of my friend asked that guy if he has a crush or not but then, he said that he doesn't have any crush. my friend was very shocked bc his instinct wasn't right. then my other male friend said that he might be lying bc he doesnt want to get exposed that he's having a crush on me.

isfp,"I‚Äôve heard other types describe ISFPs as ‚Äúintense‚Äù but it seems to me people just don‚Äôt focus on each other as much as they should.

I hate giving anyone I choose to interact with less than one hundred percent of my attention, and I‚Äôm quickly annoyed if that courtesy isn‚Äôt reciprocated. 

I‚Äôve noticed Fe users frequently and casually engage in insulting behavior like looking at their phone while on a date or in the middle of a conversation, abruptly switching their attention to someone else while you‚Äôre taking to them, walking away/looking away/interrupting while you‚Äôre talking to them, even answering the phone when I‚Äôm mid-sentence.

Even my INFJ best friend, who is very focused on others, ends up trying to please so many people at once that it‚Äôs often like people are vying for her attention. (Her four kids, husband, various friends dropping by on a daily basis, even cat ladies and riff-raff off the streets because she feeds them and donates to charities and stuff...)

Anyway. I really began to notice this a few years ago after I married an ISTP and was suddenly aware of how different our basic expectations are with regards to respectful conversation and just being present. 

I think this is why ISFPs are often solitary and easily overstimulated by social interaction. Fi is focused and perceptive. Se is present, aware. And as introverts we aren‚Äôt looking to acknowledge every person we come across.

## My daily existential trouble:

&amp;#x200B;

I don't even know where to start.Everything is so complicated.Life is so messy.Or maybe i am.

I go to college but i don't see any real future in the field i am to work in,i don't work anywere aside from some side business i start and make a few bucks,but of course that is nothing.I don't have a girlfriend or even many friends,even though i keep in touch with some of them.Most of my daily time is spent browsing the internet and walking my dog.I don't believe in my future anymore.

I mean is this what people are supposed to do in society,get a job,get married,maybe have kids and....work untill someday maybe you can have some time for....i don't even know what.Fuck.

I am horny 24/7 but i don't look for girls,i can't engage with anyone,they are all too boring and plastic.Or maybe i am,who cares anymore.

Maybe i should quit college and go somewhere far away from here,leave everything behind...just breeze and look for some fun...indulge in hedonism for a while but i know that will not last long.

Truth is i am very lost and very confused about everything,nothing about me is exceptional except how exceptionally average i am in everything as it seems.My family is ok i guess,i keep some distant contact with them but i don't want them to bother me too much.Fuck it.Fuck everything.Fuck me.",1560717018

isfp,"We were both deskmates for 6 months, bonded quickly over the same type of humour. I initially had a crush on him (it was at the very beginning of the year) and it was pretty obvious to people around us, but it evolved into a friendship after getting hints he didn't like me back. He's ISFP and I'm ENFP.

At the end of last year, we all had a major exam. During the time leading up to that, we became closer and he would ask me stuff about his crush etc. and we still had a lot of fun, I would encourage him in studies, crack even more jokes, advise about his crush etc. 

However, I wouldn't say we were close one-on-one at all. I thought we were, when one day we were just casually walking back to the classroom alone. Barely 3 minutes into the talk, I could sense it was incredibly awkward (??) and he abruptly said he was going to catch up with his male friends. 

After exam results were released this year, I scored rather well but I noticed him being upset after getting back the results. I didn't want to disturb him then, so I texted him after a while to ask if he was okay. Strangely I intuitively felt that he kept wanting to know my chosen major, as he kept asking about that. I tried to be subtle about it, and even jokingly asked him why he was so curious about it. He kinda backed off a while, and it was obvious the conversation was coming to a close. (He only replied to my messages every 4/5 days :-/) 

However, when I did tell him my chosen major after he asked a little more, he just ghosted me. It was really strange because he didn't even make up any reasons, and was actively asking me other questions, so I didn't really foresee a ghosting incoming. I was just going to wish him all the best and some notes of encouragement when he replied (which he didn't).

Then I remembered in August last year, (way after the crush phase) I overheard one of his friend teasing him about liking me, and he responded: ""No one will ever like [My Name]"" :( 

It's been a couple of months but I just feel so incredibly hurt by all of this. I have tried repeatedly telling myself to just forget it all, (my INFJ friend says he is insecure, my INTP friend says he ""just forgot to reply"", though I doubt so) but I geniunely enjoyed the times we spent together, it was really, really fun, and I really wanted to continue our friendship beyond highschool. 

He's a pretty honest, although non-confrontational person so I don't know why he would do this or even say such a hurting thing about me. I would appreciate if any ISFPs have managed to brave this long wall of text and respond with their views. Man even typing this makes me feel nostalgic and just sad.",1560417470

isfp,"Fi can cause us to make illogical or inefficient choices, get into conflict with others, get hurt way deeper than other types (especially Fe users) and derail our lives, even if we think what we're doing is right.

Se makes us prone to making rash and impulsive decisions, which fuck us up in the long run. I also see us being very prone to getting addicted to things like fast food and drugs. We're a pretty easy target for capitalist strategies, on paper.

Ni is a good thing for us to have, but since it's lower in our stack it doesn't really work out that well for us, usually. It's still a cool thing to have, though. Our PoLR Ne also makes us gullible and naive.

Te is our weak point, which causes us to be lazy, have trouble being assertive and achieving our goals, among other things.

INFPs are possibly even more screwed than ISFPs objectively speaking, since they tend to be even more reclusive and inside their heads.

As for the other types, I think they tend to have more strengths than us.

For example, ExTJs are really tough and get whatever they want done.

ExTPs have great social skills and are pretty much impossible to hurt emotionally so they can live pretty relaxed. 

FJs can easily fit in and use their social skills to thrive.

Etc.

I looked into Ne and Se but I‚Äôm not really sure which they have. I know this post does not give out much information but I am having trouble understanding how the functions present. 

I know my friend likes going outside and traveling but I wouldn‚Äôt say they are physically impulsive or over sensory in that they need to be trying new things. They do seem to have things that make them comfortable, like eating the same food every night which seems more Si. 

Most times they like to be in a relaxed environment, they don‚Äôt like a lot of clutter and live pretty scarcely. They are very withdrawn and seem to take things at face value. They don‚Äôt like to ponder endlessly like I might. They are usually calm and relaxed but even if they‚Äôre not they‚Äôre very subdued emotionally, but they can be pretty fun and off the wall sometimes. They read a ton and they also are a musician. 

Usually things we enjoy doing together are trading books or art, sharing music, going for a walks, or watching a movie. We used to date and they were very physically affectionate but needed a lot of space and alone time, and sometimes even when hanging out mostly they just talked about their day which bored me a bit because I always wanted to know what was in their head..

isfp,"Hi! So I used to get INFP all the time whenever I took any of those personality quizzes, and I've read up on cognitive functions but I'm having a hard time relying on my own self-analysis to decide what's what.

&amp;#x200B;

I like the imaginative, creative, and thoughtful way that INFPs are described, but I don't relate to the futuristic way they're described. I'm very present-minded and tend to only be motivated once I see something directly in front of me; I slacked off all of high school until I physically saw my GPA was a 2.7, and then I kicked in to hyper drive and boosted it up at the last minute. Same with these past two semesters of college now that I'm here. 

&amp;#x200B;

My mom always gets frustrated with me because I tend to miss the ""big picture"" when she's lecturing me, as I will usually take whatever she's confronting me about at face value. For example, she's visibly frustrated while asking me why I didn't clean my room, so I assume she's mad about that, when usually she's mad that I'm not being intentionally organized as a whole in life.

&amp;#x200B;

I do relate to the sensitivity of INFPs and ISFPs, for sure. I shut down really hard when it comes to criticism, and usually what does it for me is someone's tone. I could care less about what they're saying, because usually criticism has a lot of merit if you analyze it; but an overly harsh, condescending, or deceitful tone will make it really hard for me to think about it rationally. In cases like that I can get a little retaliatory--for example, ""But you do X too, why are you criticizing me about it?"" or defending myself in some way, and in the worst cases I'll become very stubborn and do the opposite of whatever someone is critiquing me to change. Generally, I try to stay calm outwardly, but inwardly I match mood for mood. An agitated or angry person makes me feel stressed, a sad person makes me feel contemplative, and a happy person makes me feel relaxed.

&amp;#x200B;

If this helps any, I'm a big fan of anime, but I tend to avoid most fandoms, because I don't usually get that serious about it. I'm not talking about like, waifus or little stuff like that, I'm saying when people get really in-depth about headcanons, ships, and alternate universes that don't actually exist within the series itself. Everyone's free to like what they like, I'd personally much rather just enjoy the show, and all that super in-depth stuff really takes the joy out of it for me. I'm fine with a great character analysis, especially if it's well-presented, but for the most part I take the characters for however they're presented and just like them as such--that's when the series is most enjoyable to me.

&amp;#x200B;

One thing I've never been able to tell is if I'm a sensor or an intuitive. I get the impression that sensors don't really care about MBTI as much, and up until a month ago with this random identity crisis I had never cared for it either. I'd taken it before, some years back or something, and got my result (which I can't remember); I was like, ""Nice. Kinda sounds like me!"" Then completely forgot about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Apart from this MBTI thing, I've generally never been deeply invested in any type of personality system, I'd take it because I was bored or because it was clearly presented as a fun joke. Same with stuff like the Zodiac symbols; figured out I was apparently a Pisces... my response? ""Cool!"" It's been that way since elementary school, which was when someone told me my sign! I always get disinterested when someone starts asking me about my sign, because I feel like that's such an unreliable and inauthentic to get to know me as an individual... just ask me whatever you want to know, that Zodiac symbol probably tells very little about who I actually am.

&amp;#x200B;

I love learning languages and writing, which seem to be an INFP thing for some reason. I learn languages by immersion, though; it's never my favorite thing to sit in class talking about the big ideas with a language, like when to use this word or which vowels cause X pattern, although that is important. I prefer to learn by playing video games, listening to music, and watching Youtube + anime in my target language, which I'd guess is more how a sensor would prefer to learn. My other hobbies include dancing, singing, drawing, and playing the drums. I prefer drawing by hand because I love the way everything smells... pencil shavings, fresh ink, thick paint... even the smell of sharpie on a chalkboard is soothing to me, haha.

&amp;#x200B;

I've broken a lot of glass in my life, but I'm not really clumsy or uncoordinated at all. I just get absent-minded easily or forget what I was doing... I've also done stuff like leaving the oven on, leaving the stove top on, leaving cabinets open, generally any sort of annoying and habitually forgetful thing you can think of. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been told I have a great fashion sense, and I love to go on websites like Pinterest and get ideas from the crazy stuff there. When I shop, I'm never thinking about a certain look, I just see something and either think ""Yes"" or ""No"". My closet is a weird mismatched collection of random pieces as a result, and I usually mix something nice for an outfit depending on my mood. My taste in pretty much everything tends to be fairly expensive, also.

&amp;#x200B;

isfp,"Has there ever been a time where you felt so constrained in your own place that you compulsively change? I'm somewhat of an example of this. For the longest time (from since I first discovered MBTI) I have identified as an ISFJ, a high Si user with a need for meticulous order just like any other ISFJ. Recently, I began a sort of self-examination with the help of an INFJ friend. Her ability to understand people and her drive to leave her mark on the world made me feel perhaps like a passive, unhealthy Si user with no grasp on my own life, surroundings, or future as well as someone who just wouldn't let myself be me. I desired so badly for change: a change in how I think that would let me understand myself, my surroundings, etc. I just wanted to wipe the slate and start clean with a new mindset. Well, I eventually got so fed up and became so angered with my own way of thinking that I did change... I think?

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I re-took that personality test, the one I'm sure everyone knows (16 Personalities). And I get my results back saying I match the ISFP personality. I thought maybe it was wishful thinking, so after a while I take the test again, this time with slightly more pronounced ISFP traits. I think part of what catalyzed this is where I am in life; I'll be going off to college this fall. And it seems like what I did was a very ISFP thing, changing myself. Currently, my story at large is really one of self-understanding and I find I'm doing that through seeking new experiences and analyzing where they fit into my world of thinking. Correct me if this is more of a Si thing to do, and maybe if I don't seem like an ISFP personality. I recognize that Fi and Si seem similar but that Si focuses more on personal meaning in experiences vs. personal morals? Something like that?

Background: im a 25 year old female isfp in a relationship with my 27 year old boyfriend who is an ISTP. We've been together for 3 ish years. Im happy in this relationship and have no plans on acting on this crush.


The main part of the attraction stems from the fact that the crush is more conventionally attractive, so its mostly an infatuation type crush.

I also think its an infatuation because I've only known my crush for like 4 days (but we've been working together so we've spent like 4hrs a day together every day. )

However, ive found we have a lot in common in terms of movie interests, speech patterns, and personality. Which is why is a crush and not just an attraction.

I cant avoid him and i dont want to either obsess about the attraction or try and block out because its just gonna get worse if i do.

I feel bad that a large part of why im attracted to the infj is shallow. Is there anyone else that has moved on ( or even didnt move on) from something like this in their relationship, who can give me some advice on how to move on from this situation?




(( optional but helpful info:
-while i love my boyfriend he's not been the best at keeping up his health. 

--He has a skin condition ive been helping him with. but other than the basics ive taught him he continues certain habits (Like scratching) that worsen his condition. 

    (This is especially frustrating because this condition is slightly contagious)
--hes also gained about 10 pounds since we started dating putting him at a BMI of 29 (i know the bmi has its limitations but hes at the over weight section of the bmi and it is getting close to the obese bmi which is 30 or greater)
--im still attracted to him and we have a v. healthy sex life though))

I cant bring up this crush with my boyfriend because i know it will make him worried and jealous. Hes also insecure because there is a large difference in attraction between us so i think this makes him a little paranoid about cheating as well.",1560119574

isfp,"I hate making a big scene and don't feel the need to whine about whatever I'm feeling. I usually just say what I'm feeling in a normal tone once and if no one picks it up - that's that. 

I once feel down a staircase and later that same day I met up with a friend and told him what happened and that I think I might have broken a rib. He said 'Nah, I've broken a rib and you would be in much more pain'.... turns out I broke a rib lol 

My friend got put in a mental institution the other day because she always ranted about her emotional state and people got worried. Our entire friendship group is worried about her but no one even flinched when I calmly expressed my suicidal thoughts months back, I even told them I took a bunch of pills once within that same time period.

isfp,"Please add a little descriptor or something with your reply.. I am curious what type of man I would mesh well with.

My ex was an INTP and all we did was argue. He was kind of a know-it-all, which annoyed the crap out of me, because he was always correcting me and he never apologized for frustrating me. I am conservative and he didn't agree with many of my right wing traditionalist opinions (it is just how I was raised). He did not like my carefree ""oh well"" attitude. I'm pretty spontaneous and indecisive, he hated that LOL complained about it pretty often. He described me as flighty and said he could never imagine having a child with me :( which led to our breakup, because I want to get married and have kids one day. 

I'd say I did not like his laziness (he was not outdoorsy, I am) and his lack of romance, chivalry. I like protective men, he was not protective at all. He wasn't traditional at all and disagreed with my political opinions. I just say things without sugarcoating much, he would correct me if I said something politically incorrect. He had troubles with masculinity so he would get very offended when I told him to ""man up"" or ""be a man"". He was verrrry lazy, liked to spend his free time playing video games or watching movies. I like doing stuff (I guess that is the sensor in me) and being in bed with him so much made me feel trapped. It took him months to get a job. And yes, I communicated this to him. I communicated A LOT with him, eventually he withdrew and would take forever to get back to me. We lived 2 hours apart so it made me upset that he couldn't take 2 mins out of his day to send me a text telling me how he is doing. I need a guy who will communicate. I'd prefer someone who is buzzing my phone ready to chat with me, eager to chat with me (outside of his work and schedule ofc).

I would ideally want a man with conservative values, will want to do stuff with me; like go to the gym with me, go on drives, camping, walking, hiking, beach trips, fun stuff you know? One day when I have a family I would like to do fun stuff with the kids as well, so I need a guy who is on the same page. (My parents travelled with me very often and I have no complaints.) Family oriented, old fashioned, has a good sense of dress (my ex was very lazy about his appearance, he seemingly did not care about his appearance), a man who likes to keep busy with hobbies that are in a garage or outside, protective, health oriented, a guy who works hard at his job and would want to come home to a hot meal and a hot wife.

isfp,Thankyou all Those who participate on this Sub.,1559869788
isfp,"Disclaimer: I totally understand that we are all unique individuals and don‚Äôt fit in cut and dry of a four-letter type., and that I may be over-analyzing it, but I am only curious what others think my MBTI type could be...

So, I am very sure I am Fi-Te, just not sure if my axis(?) functions is Se-Ni or Ne-Si. 

Considerations:

I identify myself as a HSP and tend to avoid external stimulus (I wonder if that could have stunted the growth of my underdeveloped aux-Se. 

I could be an extremely unhealthy ISFP looping in Fi-Ni for some time now and appearing like my intuitive counterpart (I go through several existential crisis/angst due to my high tendency towards self-(re)examination, gets extremely disappointed/depressed my ideals that do not fit into reality, haunted by my past and hopeless of the future in general..and spiral downwards into the vortex that is the nihilistic outlook in life) 

I am on the edge of hitting my thirties mark and should be at the stage in which my tert. function is/want to start developing and seeking out Ni stuff. (again, this could be me mistaking for as an intuitive).

I am an enneagram 4w5 (or so I think). Maybe being having type 5 traits could influence my MBTI type and may explain why I often gravitate towards the cerebral (or lack of better word) stuff. 

I feel more of an intuitive with most sensors but more of a sensor with intuitives if that makes any sense (read that ISFP falls in this grey area). In conversations, I can get very impatient with the little details, regarding conversations with my ISFJ and ESTJ friends, but at lost when it gets too abstract with my INTJ and ENTP friends (with the latter, I get gist of their concepts, but it is incredible fuzzy...takes extra mental work) and can be difficult to grasp without having them break it down for me in a way that I can understand. 

Relationships; 

I feel most at home with introverts but tend to gravitate towards extroverts (could take them in small doses though) for the novelty when meeting new people. I try to treat everyone with the same respect and see them as an individual, and just share a small part of my real self with them (although I do play favorites and prioritize people I really like to share/sacrifice my social energy with) I conceal some of my personality traits due to social anxiety, and try to blend in as much as I can. Only the people that I have established a real connection gets to see all sides to my personality and beyond. 

I tend to get along very well with feelers.The healthy feelers with higher empathy are the bee knees! I noticed how we feelers (probably unconsciously) would often get super consideration of each other emotions/how we feel, and attentive to how we are feeling, which is like a double edge sword. I really like matured Fe-users; I feel like they are more emotionally open/expressive which I find very attractive as a high Fi user. 

Being a heavy feeler, I usually clash with the rationals/thinkers, depending on their emotional maturity and how forgiving they are with my inferior Te. They could help balance/ground my emotions and offer me the rationality in the alternatives. I noticed that I am more blunt/direct with thinkers, as oppose to feelers much as the latter imitate me. I enjoy the freedom to be as straight-forward as I like with thinkers and know that I won‚Äôt completely hurt their feelings (with feelers, I have to a bit more tactful). There seems to be a magnetic attraction towards the TJs. 

In theory, I am drawn to EXFPs for ideal friendships (don‚Äôt think I have met any irl yet, but I feel/imagine we could click right away and be some sort of partners in crime dynamic-duo thing with lots of nonsensicalness/inside jokes/memes). ENXJs would probably be my ideal mate. ENTXs are intriguing to me; I see them as enigmas and want to figure out how they tick-tock, but once the novelty wears off...we pretty much hate each other‚Äôs guts.

‚Äî‚Äî

Disclaimer 0.2: I am not very familiar with all the functions and just putting things that associate my understanding of what I think the each of the function means...

Se; 

I have an okay awareness of my immediate surroundings; know what‚Äôs going on given from the overall feel/vibe of the environment. I do not thrive in chaos like the SP temperaturement descriptions  claims...I completely shut down. 

I like to point out almost everything that I've notice in my surroundings in a very child-like way. I am most carefree when in the present moment.  

I do not prioritize my Se very much and have no real interest in chasing after sensory stimulation/experiences. I think my Fi kind of devalues Se. I don‚Äôt really care about missing out on new experiences all that much. I stay indoors for lengthy period of time and I never ""do"" anything, but I really like the idea of doing things...and never really following through them. 

I do fall into my bouts of self-indulgence due to high stress/impulsiveness/excitability (when my emotions are in a ‚Äòmania mode‚Äô), but I notice it is as mean of escapism rather than a life satisfactory/fulfillment thing. I do not have bipolar disorder, I don‚Äôt think so. 


Si;

Honestly, I do not have a full understanding of what Si is and taking a wild guess on this one...

I have the worst memory and cannot recall the small details at all, seriously. I mix up the order word of sentences and totally off with quoting famous people. High Si users would probably deem me as unintelligent/forgetful. 

I very often tend to overlook details and hard facts a lot. But when I am planning/studying, I get super nitpicky with the minor details and write out a step-by-step guide. This is how I try to be more organized. I stresses me out like no other having to follow rigid rules and being very detail-oriented. 

I went through phases of obsession with various historic eras and romanticized how it would be like living in that period. I invented my own fantasy friends instead of going out there in the real world and make real friends. I still do that. 

I am extremely nostalgic and sentimental. Very prone up bring up things/stories of the past from the present. Call talk lengthy hours on everything related to my childhood. May have add embellishment here and there...


Ne; 

I am absolutely terrible considering the possibilities/not good at seeing situations from all angles. I usually draw a completely blank when I have to provide examples of something, specially to elaborate my point; absolutely terrible with explaining things. 

But I can see the other side of an argument and tend to debate against it, just for the mental exploration/speculation. 

I really enjoy word play/puns (cannot say I very witty though--I make up my own logic and get a laugh at how absurd/illogical it is). I tend to be easily amused of the mundane of daily life. I make these vague connection to things that seems like it may have a double meaning. Sometimes I read too much into things when there is none. I make a lot of assumptions and projection. 

I enjoy novelty a lot and like to change up on things. I cannot stick with a consistent routine and pretty flexible it plans changes (depends). 

I am not sure if I get off tangents. Maybe I do but not very aware of it if I do because it feels like I my conversations/discussions are pretty linear. I often catch myself when being very preachy. 

I say a lot of random nonsensical things to see how much bullshit I can get away with, and to provoke for a reaction from people in a non-direct way (more playful/softcore-trolling than hardcore-trolling... if that‚Äôs a thing). I find it amusing to deliberately confuse/mislead people with my paradoxical word play and such. I like to do this with my Ne-Ti/Ti-Ne users friends because they don‚Äôt take it all too seriously and we can play off our humor/goofiness...until they decide it‚Äôs becoming too much of a jester fest and they go full-on/cut me off with their Ti, and Ti-lecture me why it doesn‚Äôt make sense in any given  context. 

Ni; 

I am drawn to the curiosities and oddities of life. I also am very interested in philosophy, psychology and spirituality. Can get very obsessed with the whys, and discovering the 'truths' of the universe. When I find a topic of interest, I can get addicted to hoarding information because my mind is weird and wants to take these side-projects of solving some on missing link to whatever theory I had in the moment that probably was just me falling out of reality and descending into some sort of madness as an coping mechanism of some sort. probably. I get into these long-winded rambles/rants and try to make things into some sort of philosophical discussions. 

Probably just human; I dislike having to do small talk with a passion. I get very drained having to talk about and listen to people talk in details/hard facts and the superficial . I bear with it out of politeness but to be honest, I am either daydreaming or timing for my escape to opt out of the conversation.


Te; 

Next to Si, I have not the faintest clue what Te is really is either... my weakest function and most insecure of all insecurities, I fall short on efficiency and it hurts so much. 

I am more familiar with Ti (I feel it‚Äôs very similar to Fi) and seem to understand how Ti users process their thoughts. I am nowhere as natural but I do try to create my own framework by destructing an idea with the whole ‚Äòasking the same question but in different forms‚Äô critical thinking thing (not really sure what I‚Äôm talking about here, to be honest) 


Fi Rambles (feel free to skip this section);

I have a theory that high Fi are more likely to feel misunderstood//different/broken at their core due to their Fi. Because Fi is very individualistic and our experiences are generally unique as a whole, it can make be extra difficult for us connect with others (even with other Fi users), especially if our values do not align... does that mean we are likely to be forever alone...?


So, thoughts? Any ISFPs or INFPs find any of this related at all? Side note: I‚Äôm starting to doubt my insanity a bit --with writing out all this on paper, realized it was pretty much a complete waste of time just wanting to figure things out...but pretty proud of how I neatly I kinda got this all sorted out. Okay, I gotta cut off my rambling here now...

isfp,"I dont know if its just me or an ispf thing but people, at times, don't notice when I'm joking. 

My day-to-day humor is usually repeating what others say if they use strange wording in a completely normal tone. 

Two exemples: 
1. A stranger asked me if he could 'borrow a smoke' and I said 'yeah you can borrow one' 
(Really fucking boring I know haha but just a quick comment that went unnoticed) 

2.A few years ago a 30+ guy was flirting with me at my older brothers birthday party and he asked me age and I said 'I'm only 18' and he replied 'wow' and I just repeated his 'wow' and he didn't catch on but another dude who was with us let out a chuckle. 

Stuff like this and also just saying stuff like 'that's cool/funny' when someone tells me about something horrible. Usually I just get taken by the word.

isfp,"I'm an INTP girl having crush on a guy with ISFP personality. I saw his profile in a dating app, and pinged him.

A few things about us:

1. He's a very text-oriented person, whereas I'm more of a conversational person.
2. We live quite far away (we actually need to take flight to see each other)

We started texting and it seemed like he was interested talking to me (and the feeling is mutual) - he would ask more about me, my characteristics, etc. But he just wouldn't call (even if I wanted to initiate the call), and would just say some or the other reasons - watching a football match and forgot about our call, etc.

But the problem is, he gives me mixed signals - like he's not a believer of MBTI, but takes MBTI and tells me just because I asked. After that, I tried to ask about what would make him realize that he's found THE one and then, the strange thing happened - he stopped messaging / being curious about me altogether.

Ok, to be fair, he said he was busy with his work - like he needed to juggle two works. But I'm not sure if people can be that busy.. If someone's interested in another, at least some efforts need to be taken right?

But, he doesn't NOT reply me back. Like if I message him, he'll definitely reply. And finally he called me and we spoke for like an hour and I felt that the conversations were not forced (while I was a little nervous). He seemed quite comfortable over the call. And when he was about to hang up, he said it's really nice talking to me and that he would call me back.

And then, BAM no message again. What should I do? I don't want to text him again and make it feel like I'm clingy, yet I really can't stop thinking about our conversations. Help please!!! What should I do?

isfp," A family member highly recommended *The Outlander* series to me and I‚Äôm on the second book (they‚Äôre all pretty long) in like, an eight-book saga or some shit. And I‚Äôve already decided it will be my last.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong - there‚Äôs a lot of adventure and swashbuckling and espionage, etc. But a substantially large part of the story is devoted to this intense romance between the two main characters akin those from those old timey bodice-ripper westerns. 

And the author just keeps droning on about it and focusing how much these two love each other. Reminds me of *Twilight* or *The Vampire Diaries*...so much potential for action and adventure bogged down by sappy ass romance.

Are all ISFPs like that? Do you find yourself rolling your eyes at the idea of candle-lit dinners and over-the-top gestures (like people proposing to you in public or having a fancy wedding and stuff?)

I am romantic, but it‚Äôs my own ideas of romance. Like being surprised with a cool outing or vacation or even a small gesture, like flowers brought home for no reason.

For example, when my classmate were cheated, i make a joke about him literally everday. Although, he punched me pretty brutal, i didnot stop and continueing joking him. I even make my parody about him, i have no intent to offend him or make him angry, i joke him just for fun. Sometimes, i open up to a person that have the same interest as me. Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow? Nope Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it? Nope, but sometimes, especially chinese new year, my family go to the pagoda to wish a lucky new year. Although it is pretty short, i donot like it. If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed? I felt pretty relaxed, i enjoyed it. What is your relation with movement and your surroundings? For instance do you prefer a sport or outdoors event? If an outdoors event what is it? And why? If not what type of activities do you tend to engage i? I like indoor event. I like playing games, that involves action and Spontaneous, there is no need for long term planning. For example, fps games. And recently, i like watching movies too. To analyze the quotes, the character's mood, and striving for a deeper meaning. Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be? Honestly, i donot like being a leader at all. I see there is no need to controlling people. Even if i become a leader, i donot lead them very well, they just do it their way, i donot care about them, i am kind of apathy toward it. I am an analytical leader. What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them? Past is a great lesson that can apply into the present and the future. Present is the moment that we are living now, we should appreciate it.Future isnot something that should be worried. How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so? I will try to help them if i amnot busy. Do you need logical consistency in your life? Of course, because everything exist for a reasonable purpose. Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that? Nope, only if they bugging my life, then i will have to outlist them by myself. What are your hobbies? Why do you like them? Playing fps, and minecraft. Because i want to kill ppl in games, and sometimes builing house which apply the most modern technology from the version. What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses? my learning style is visual. My weakness is audio, because i donot good at keep attention for a long time.

isfp,"Have you ever picked up an object (a movie ticket, for example) and been taken back to the feelings you experienced at the time you watched the film? I'm not saying that you remember a lot about the film/who you were with/details/etc., but that you remember how you felt in that moment? I would think that Fi combined with Si or Ni could do this.

Another example of Fi tied to memory might be that someone mentions taking you to a car dealership and you have an immediate emotional response to this. Maybe that response is irritation because you remember hating the salesperson the last time you went to the dealership. 

Some describe Ni as more present and future focused whereas Si is more present and past focused. However, I've heard that Ni is simply a ""wide"" and less definted focus whereas Si is a ""clear"" focus and/or higher definition. I'm thus curious if this emotion-tied-to-memory resonates with other IxFPs.",1558898973

This means I fall into relationships quickly, regardless of how right we are for each other. If someone shows me attention, I'm hooked. Then, no matter how wrong we are, I'll make it work until it kills me and convince myself that we're a good match.

isfp,"Can't speak from a Fe perspective, but I'll share my Fi one:

* Regarding people, I initially am neutral towards people. I'll just be friendly and polite towards them. If I get close to them, I start valuing them as if they're an extension of me, or even a part of me. I'll be extremely loyal to them, as well. If I dislike someone, I won't go out of my way to do anything to them, but I'll always have them on some sort of mental blacklist where I'll just ignore them and completely distrust them. They're simply an obstackle, and if someone asks me what I think of them, I'll just tell them that these people suck. With people I'm neutral about, I just don't really think much about those. So basically, it's often very strong like, or very strong dislike.

* As for things like hobbies and interests, I tend to have a similar attachment, and this is also one of my weak points as a Fi dom: I can get really angry when people openly mock or hate on these, and it's a really easy way to get a permanent entry on my blacklist in no time. I simply deeply value these things, and if someone goes out of their way to attack or criticize these, I won't stand for that. I'm not going to return the favor or anything, live and let live and all, but don't expect me to ever help you out, be nice to you or anything else. I'll do the absolute bare minimum.

So, about Fe, I haven't the slightest idea how this works for Fe users. Obviously Fe users have friends, family, hobbies and interests as well, but I'm not exactly sure how they see these. To my observation from outside it seems like Fe for the most part is very circumstancial. They get less attached to things, they seem fine with mocking or criticizing their own interests and hobbies if the people around them dislike these things, they seem fine with lying to people to maintain harmony instead of keeping a friendship pure and honest, when someone close to them dies a Fi user will be highly hurt by it and stay sad for a long time but Fe users seem to forget about it relatively quickly, and I've heard of and noticed that ExTPs (PoLR Fi, tert Fe) have trouble with getting close to people, and only really seem to act affectionately when in close proximity. They also move on disturbingly quick.

Now, while I did note the negative things about Fe users here, I don't mean to roast them, just pointing out what it seems like to me. I'm curious how this aspect exactly works for both Fi and Fe users, and what the differences are.",1558527063

isfp,"Ok, so I know this may be controversial, but I've noticed that my Myers-Briggs has changed a lot in the past 5-6 years (I'm currently 19), especially with I'd say the biggest change in my life. However, even more recent changes have occurred in the extent of each metric: E/I, S/N, F/T, P/J, while I have stayed ISFP consistently for the past at least year (according to my tests on 16personalities.) What are your thoughts on this?

I think psychology says your personality type is supposed to describe what you do most of the time. I suppose right now, I'm most concerned about my introversion. I'm close to being extroverted, maybe closer than I have ever scored on a 16personalities test, and I'm honestly confused as to how this metric reflects how I act. I seem to enjoy being with people more because I'm more relaxed; however, I seem to want to be around people less. Maybe it's because I finally learned how to be alone after discovering what hobbies I really enjoyed after working as cashier in fast food tired me out and gave me less time to study.",1558418833

isfp,"Me, INTJ, and my ISFP girlfriend have been together for about 2 months now.  We always have a great time together and enjoy each other‚Äôs company when ever we are together. But when ever I ask her what she wants to do, where she wants to go, where she wants to eat, she always responds with something like ‚ÄúOh I don‚Äôt care, I‚Äôm not picky‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhat ever you want to do‚Äù or maybe a cute ‚ÄúAs long as you are there I don‚Äôt care.‚Äù But it‚Äôs kind of frustrating because I don‚Äôt think in 2 months she has ever picked a date idea, which restaurant we eat at, ect.

I don‚Äôt mind making the decisions but I want to know what she would like to do. I want to know what she wants so I can make that happen for her and make her happy.  She always seems happy and I think I‚Äôm doing a pretty good job so far but I have to rack my brain for things that she would like because she will never ask. 

I don‚Äôt know if she is just too shy, has confidence issues, or just hates making decisions and plans. I was wondering if this was a normal thing for y‚Äôall, and if there was anything I could do to idk break her out of her bubble or be a little more expressive to me. Any advice?",1558131248

isfp,"Hii, reason I posted here was because there were types I considered to be when looking into cognitive functions, if i posted in the wrong place or I'm not supposed to, please let me know. Anyways I will try to be as descriptive as possible, so I certainly do hope this doesn't go to waste. Anyways to introduce myself, I'm a 19 year old guy who seems to be your average dude (or at least I think so?). Everyone views me as Cool-headed, calm, hardworking and just behind the scenes. I'm also seen as mild-mannered and relaxed at all times, mostly because Its just who I am. I try my best to be honest and blunt about things, because genuinely I don't like beating around the bush with most things in life. Don't waste my time and I won't waste yours. I'm not as controlling as I used to be, but I still desire to be a clean person with everything in place. 

In terms of personal issues, I have plenty. I tend to be seen as incredibly no-nonsense and clean-cut when it comes to solving problems. I usually go out of my way to advise others on what to do, and if they don't listen, I can't help but to think what's on your mind that you aren't doing anything about it. I struggle with expressing my own emotions frequently, because I tend to try to focus on being logical above all else. But in the end I end up depressed and sulking over my own thoughts and feelings. Not to mention I am incredibly short-tempered but will most of the time contain it. I can be super vengeful and vindictive at my worst, but at my best I'm probably the most efficent and cool-headed person you will ever meet. What offends me deeply and personally is if there is dishonesty, incompetence, or disrespect towards me.

In a way, I kinda think logically and far into the future, to the point of depressing myself. I always ask ""will this be here forever with the next 10+ years?"" ""Will I live long enough to see everything go well?"" ""Am I losing time in finding a purpose in life??"" These questions come into mind often. Not to mention I am not the most creative person there is...like at all. I find it a flaw to brainstorm multiple things and all of them being useless or not in depth. What I look for is depth and purpose in life. I don't like trying out new things that are unecessary. I don't really see the past as a big thing in my life at all. I see it as a lesson and if it was something good, a nice part of my life I can be proud of. But I'm always looking foward and ahead, because drowning in the past will only slow me down. Its easy for me to get over things, and I can sometimes not place an importance on small details.

I'll be honest, I sometimes do like hands-on work. Mostly because I'm in control of it and I know I am capable of getting things done. One of my biggest fears is not having enough experience and knowledge to continue my goals of being a Police Officer or being appointed in a position of authority. I dont have financial aid nor do I have much help or support. So I really I want to learn anything that involves my goals. I rarely ever deviate from anything useful or revelant to my interests. 

I'm not a materialistic person, I don't really value money, status, rank, or anything of the sort. I value simply having a purpose to life and finding out what I am meant for. I don't really care about society or people at all if I'm sincere. I mostly care about myself and those very close that I love. I think I'm an introvert because most of the time I genuinely don't like being around people and it can drain me. I especially hate being polite and having manners because it's all bullshit. I like things to be straightforward, not to have to pretend to be someone I dont like. 

If this helps, most people that come across in my life has always considered me a bit cruel when it comes to being blunt about things (even though I feel like I'm not blunt enough). My sibling thinks that certain characters that he sees in movies/games that relate to being calm and collected is me lol. My ex who I am close with now considers me to be someone who doesn't spare anyone's feelings, and can be short tempered when things don't go the way I want them to. I'm considered fair and kind-hearted, but cross me and I make no qualms about cutting you off from my life. I try not to let hatred become a motivation, but merely having common sense and being down to earth. 

I tend to notice I never feel anything genuine with people, or at least sympathize with anyone. Not sure if that has to do with anything. I don't really care about having a bunch of friends, I only care about having a close group of people, and beyond that are merely distant. Even though I'm super introspective and self-aware, I can't help but to feel conflicted with my personal feelings compared to what is logically the best thing for me and others. I assume that's normal for my age, but I feel the more I wait and do nothing, the less of a chance I have to do something significant. I want to have that drive that I will stop at nothing to accomplish w.e purpose or goal is in store for me. Everyone has a place in life, but I want to make sure I'm fulfilling mines and forging it myself. 

Good luck typing me ig. I just had a certain thought to it all, and I don't think I'm an INTJ, mostly because I feel like the stereotype kinda ruined my perception of it all. I don't enjoy being a smart-ass, because honestly I'm just someone with common sense and a rational mind, I'm not a genius. But the only types I've come to see a bit with me is ISTJ, ISFP, INTJ, ISTP, and the really improbable but still a possibility is INTP or INFJ. You guys determine that based on w.e proof you have. I'd just like to know why you believe it. Ask me things to clarify if you are unsure about what I meant on something.

MY PERSONAL OBSERVATION:
If there is one thing I struggle with knowing, is whether I'm a sensor or intuitive. I've had this struggle for a while because I value both. While I'm not very good at being creative or dreaming up completely different worlds, I am very interested at understanding subjects that are practical and can be impactful in my surroundings. I'm known for being physically clumsy at times, but I nevertheless am known for being on my feet and understanding what's going on around me and beyond the curtain. 

I struggle also with knowing whether I use Te or Ti because both seem to apply to what I use. I am not a controlling person at all, but I do like things to go according to how I want it. I definitely believe I'm a Fi user over Fe because Fi describes exactly how i feel on the inside, though I struggle with emotions in general. If I understood these functions a bit better, I might make a better observation, but I'm going with my guts with this.",1558118135

- Agree
- Small Agree
- Medium
- Small Disagree
- Disagree

For me, I would choose, small disagree because, I  prefer smaller groups, most of all I like talking 1 on 1, however I feel like it is interesting and fun to meet new people at times although I am not that good at it.

I don't really care about society or people at all if I'm sincere. I mostly care about myself and those very close that I love. I think I'm an introvert because most of the time I genuinely don't like being around people and it can drain me. I especially hate being polite and having manners because it's all bullshit. I like things to be straightforward, not to have to pretend to be someone I dont like. 

If this helps, most people that come across in my life has always considered me a bit cruel when it comes to being blunt about things (even though I feel like I'm not blunt enough). My sibling thinks that certain characters that he sees in movies/games that relate to being calm and collected is me lol. My ex who I am close with now considers me to be someone who doesn't spare anyone's feelings, and can be short tempered when things don't go the way I want them to. I'm considered fair and kind-hearted, but cross me and I make no qualms about cutting you off from my life. I try not to let hatred become a motivation, but merely having common sense and being down to earth. 

I tend to notice I never feel anything genuine with people, or at least sympathize with anyone. Not sure if that has to do with anything. I don't really care about having a bunch of friends, I only care about having a close group of people, and beyond that are merely distant. Even though I'm super introspective and self-aware, I can't help but to feel conflicted with my personal feelings compared to what is logically the best thing for me and others. I assume that's normal for my age, but I feel the more I wait and do nothing, the less of a chance I have to do something significant. I want to have that drive that I will stop at nothing to accomplish w.e purpose or goal is in store for me. Everyone has a place in life, but I want to make sure I'm fulfilling mines and forging it myself. 

Good luck typing me ig. I just had a certain thought to it all, and I don't think I'm an INTJ, mostly because I feel like the stereotype kinda ruined my perception of it all. I don't enjoy being a smart-ass, because honestly I'm just someone with common sense and a rational mind, I'm not a genius. But the only types I've come to see a bit with me is ISTJ, ISFP, INTJ, ISTP, and the really improbable but still a possibility is INTP or INFJ. You guys determine that based on w.e proof you have. I'd just like to know why you believe it. Ask me things to clarify if you are unsure about what I meant on something.

MY PERSONAL OBSERVATION:
If there is one thing I struggle with knowing, is whether I'm a sensor or intuitive. I've had this struggle for a while because I value both. While I'm not very good at being creative or dreaming up completely different worlds, I am very interested at understanding subjects that are practical and can be impactful in my surroundings. I'm known for being physically clumsy at times, but I nevertheless am known for being on my feet and understanding what's going on around me and beyond the curtain. 

I struggle also with knowing whether I use Te or Ti because both seem to apply to what I use. I am not a controlling person at all, but I do like things to go according to how I want it. I definitely believe I'm a Fi user over Fe because Fi describes exactly how i feel on the inside, though I struggle with emotions in general. If I understood these functions a bit better, I might make a better observation, but I'm going with my guts with this.",1557978769

isfp,"Eyo, I'm looking around and can hardly find anything on people's experiences or thoughts on ISFP/ISTP relationships. I've been long distance with and ISTP for about a year and a half and would love to hear how this works for others? I'm wondering what it could potentially be like when we're actually living closer together and see each other more than fortnightly/monthly. SO I'm about to blab, anyone with experience with an ISFP/ISTP relationship relate to these things, and anyone who's interested got some thoughts?   


About us:  
\- We're never bored when we're together, and my ISTP always wants to be doing something (when he goes quiet his mind's often racing a few hours or days ahead about what could be happening, something I can't relate to). (kinda zooms into Ni/Ti)   
\- He likes to be pushed a little to do certain things that he hasn't made a habit of yet. But he's waaay better at keeping things as habits than me. (Fe? Ni?) (why would an ISTP be better at making habits than an ISFP? He is in his 30s and I'm in my 20s though so maybe that impacts it and his Ni's more developed)  
\-While he's ""practical"" if he's never done something he'll be extremely impractical and can't necessarily see repercussions of certain things unless he's experienced those firsthand. As an ISFP when I can see these potential faults coming I have to pull up my boot straps and tell him, and try my best to explain in a ""Ti""ish way, reasoning and shit. Can you imagine an ISFP telling an ISTP what he's planning is irrational? Lmao. (tertiary Ni... Again not sure why an ISFP would see the impracticalness in an ISTP of all people... Could just be how Ti works)   
\- Also it's a very physical relationship, over a conversational one (not something I personally mind, we still have entertaining conversations especially now I've relaxed around him. (Se, and my lack of Te to balance it out) He can take up my physical space up a bit much, very cuddly lol.   


\- It took me months to ""open up"" to him, like, around a year, and he was a bit oblivious to that. At this stage I can be my dorky self around him though and be honest when I'm uncomfortable. Physically was no issue :pp Talking about sex I would say the Fi/Fe difference isn't sooo great. Hahaha (sorry dude). (My Fi/ his inferior Fe)   


\- My ISTP thank the lords is kinda in touch with his Fe. He's a total sweetie. Very supportive. Wants me to think about myself in crucial big decisions first which is great 'cause I'm shit at that. We both try and understand and support each other's interests, he supports my art, and I try and understand when he talks about his mechanically hobbies.",1557957608
isfp,"Hey ISFP‚Äôs! INFJ here!

First a little appreciation. As an INFJ it is extremely rare for someone to take the time and effort to get to actually know me. ISFP‚Äôs gentle love is wonderful at that.

Second I‚Äôm in need of a little insight. I, INFJ male, met an ISFP female in January. Long story short we hit it off, I asked her out, she just started dating another guy so couldn‚Äôt. We‚Äôre in the same friend group so I couldn‚Äôt cut ties and she was hurt when I put some distance between us. We hang out a few times a month just the two of us, and we get along extremely well. I mentioned last week I was moving out of my place and she asked me to move in with her. My INFJ heart is very confused. We are so clearly compatible, I asked her out only a few months ago so she knows I have feelings for her, we spend a lot of time alone together even though she‚Äôs with someone else, and now she wants to move in together.

isfp,"Hello everyone, true blue ISFP male here. I have identified my strengths and weaknesses - doing physical activities, being carefree, being slightly dreamy and mostly lazy, can't plan ahead for my life, etc. - typical ISFP personality. 

I am in late 20s. I have tried many solo sports. Only things that have stuck is tennis and powerlifting. Activity wise I have tried many things - cooking, woodworking, fishing, shooting, writing, listening to music, etc - I like most of them and keep switching back and forth. Career wise it sucks that after 1-2 years, I get bored and have to look for something new (have done it twice now). Currently trying my hand at startups but nearing my 2 year mark, so losing steam. Even though its going good but it will take another 2 years of hard work to earn any kind of real money.

I need to fill my day with activities proactively, otherwise I feel life is too slow and boring. Even though I am lazy, I hate sitting around. Day full of activities makes me engaged in the moment, but there is no unifying purpose to the whole thing.

 So my question to you all - Do anybody else feel the same thing? How do we find a larger purpose &amp; meaning in life when we find all tasks mundane after sometime? Will we be always hopping from one activity to another? 

Really looking for some good suggestions.
P.S. I am not depressed.",1557669611
isfp,"(If too long, skip to italicized part.)

Can somebody please provide me with some insight? I (female INTP) have been talking with the guy (male ISFP) for three months. In that time we have only met on three occasions due to our busy schedules.

When I first tried to gage his interest, he told me that he was serious and that he could see something more between us. Then he disappeared for five days, and when we next spoke, he told me he didn‚Äôt think he had the time to put into a relationship between his demanding job and building his own house.

Fair enough. Except we continued to talk...and we went on another date. It was great, but a couple days later (after especially flirtatious texting) he disappeared again...another week goes by.

Then, two weeks ago, he sends me this:

*You‚Äôre a super kind hearted girl, i really appreciate that from you. 
I feel like you dont open up to most guys, so i consider myself fortunate :) Im terrible at having these serious conversations with girls, just like how flirting through text can sometimes be awkward haha. But i just dont want to lead you on or make you feel that ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù feeling, as it would be unfair to you. 
You mentioned intimacy and companionship, im glad we could hang out and be comfortable with each other (at least i think so!) 
For sure i was interested in you, still am! You‚Äôre an interesting girl, difficult to figure out, super good looking and i kinda find you fascinating haha. Im just not looking to pursue a relationship. You mentioned you‚Äôre on the same page as that?*

I thought that was the end of it, and didn‚Äôt want to disrespect him by continuing to pursue him, but he has very much continued to show interest in me, albeit not explicitly.

I really like this guy, a lot, and I have no problem being patient and taking things slow...so long as I know that there is the *possibility* it may become something down the line.

Should I be taking him more seriously and walk away? Or does it seem like there‚Äôs a chance? Should I let him know how I feel? If so, how could I do so without scaring him away?

isfp,"So just to anonymize this a bit, let's say I belong to an artist's union, and me (INTJ) and ISFP friend joined up about the same time. We hang out and talk about art supplies a lot, and really enjoy it.

Well, it turns out that this friend has an extra set of homemade brushes and some equipment and wants to bring it over for me to try out. 

Lately he's kind of taking me under his wing, talking like, ""I'll help you out, show you how this stuff works, etc. Let's get you all set up!""

Normally this is kind of the INTJ approach, to be the didactic half of the relationship :D, so I'm kind of wondering if I should just play ISFP and let him teach me and be really sweet. I feel like it would be pretty easy to do that BUT I worry that the truth will come out!

And that hard truth is that I have done a metric ton of this shit in a previous career. lol. Like I've done for huge paychecks what he has done as a hobby, and I'm SO AFRAID he's going to find out and feel bad about that, and feel like he's embarrassed and then not want to hang out.

I worry because every time I admit something little that I know, that he doesn't know how to do, he's like :O and then tells his friends, ""guys, this dude knows how to X"". I'm like, ""anyway I'm not a big deal, I have a lot to learn"" because I really like this guy and I don't want to come off like a douche and I think it's so cool that he wants to share what he's good at.

Basically, I‚Äôm talking to an ESFP rn. Classic ESFP. Super flirty, absolute party animal. Which at first really bothered me as I was like ‚Äúyehh this won‚Äôt really work as anything more than friends‚Äù. However; I‚Äôve felt myself really falling for her and I can tell she‚Äôs interested in me, by the looks of it more than she is in other people. She‚Äôs actively cut things down with people, became much less flirty with others and tried to gain my attention much more.

One of the things which drew me in was her making a super nice personalised birthday gift for a friend. It made me so happy that someone who on the outside may seem superficial and flirty, had such a genuine core and wanted to make someone close so happy. 

My only real worry is of course; them being unable to truly commit and that she‚Äôll get bored and move on. Stereotypically it‚Äôs apparently what they do and even personally, I can kinda see it in her.

Which is why I‚Äôm stuck. In my head I‚Äôm like ‚Äúwhat if this is just some superficial relationship which won‚Äôt truly mean anything or last‚Äù.

isfp,"This is a bit long, but it feels wrong not to explain my perspective. Fi run amuck again. Feel free to skip to the questions below. 

&amp;#x200B;

PROFESSIONAL: 

Do you worry that you are not a ""professional"" enough person? Professional as in a person/employee/etc. with knowledge they can confidently give people eloquently. I think about professionalism in terms of being the go-to person for assistance. There is a sort of friendliness associated with the term for me in that people approach professionals with the confidence that they will know how to direct them. Great sales people, teachers, public speakers, and so on are typically seen as the caricature of ""professional"" that I often attribute to what I lack. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fi BLAH BLAH &amp; THE ASPIRING FUNCTION: 

I personally don't inhabit this sense of professional and it heavily bothers me as it tends to make employment extremely difficult (INFP). I'm often highly aware of how much I don't know and how jumbled my explainations can be. I often say ""I hate working with people,"" but only mean it in terms of strangers. I typically like to chat with coworkers as I do not have to ""perform"" being ""professional"" for them once we are friendly. **However**, I've often considered that I would be my most highly evolved person once I reached ""professionalism."" I've read that given the 4th slot is the ""aspirational function,"" we may live our lives trying to feed it. To our growth or to our detriment. 

&amp;#x200B;

I grew up thinking I would become a Professor, but once given the opportunity to be a teaching assistant in graduate school, I almost passed out from the presentation anxiety several times. Everytime I got up to teach it was a strange mix of fear, empowerment, curiousity, and absolute hate. Naturally, I seriously started doubting my life course to become a Professor, but looking back now I still imagine myself ""evolving"" if I can just white knuckle my anxiety into that ""professional"" career that puts me into the spotlight that INFPs most often hate. In my case, I consider several careers until I find my way back to wanting to be a historian again, which seems like some kind of Si-Te wish fulfillment, although my Fi-Ne is often fired up with the research projects I choose to dive into and thus being a historian isn't *just* to serve some kind of Pokemon upgrade. (The fact that academic jobs are somewhat unicorns themselves is besides the point. The revolving desire of this professional career from an unprofessional person is what interests me.) 

&amp;#x200B;

QUESTIONS:

I'm wondering if this ""professional"" issue has to do with Te in the 4th slot? Maybe 4th slot Fe could bring this on for someone too? I'm not sure whether shadow functions apply here as the ""I'm not professional enough"" is a conscious assertion. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any other INFPs or other types with a similar issue? If it's a Te worry, I'd assume maybe ISFPs know the feeling as well? 

&amp;#x200B;

For people who do consider themselves professional: What's your type and do you attribute it to a particular function?

isfp,"Hey, INTJ man dating an ISFP woman.

&amp;#x200B;

It's become an increasing pattern that many times, my girlfriend will just seem to drop off the radar for me-time without a heads up. She lives separate from me. This will happen during a period when she'll just normally go home, but then, it'll be a day or two before she even makes a move to talk to me. When I ask what she's been up to, ""just chores, housework, watching TV"". I'll notice she's been active on other social media.

&amp;#x200B;

Being a stressed INTJ, I'll begin to look for patterns. I feel like because I didn't get a notice she needed me-time, something else is amiss. Is she losing interest in me? Is she talking to someone else on social media? Do I not mean enough to her to let me know? I'll ask sometimes in ways that can seem accusatory.

&amp;#x200B;

Do other ISFPs have a problem communicating when they need alone time? I wish she'd understand that just letting me know will prevent my mind from trending toward cynical scenarios based on forced patterns that I'll make up in my brain. It's like chicken before the egg. If she gives me a polite notice, I'd not feel so insecure and probe her in ways that want her feel the need for more space.

&amp;#x200B;

I know I'm at fault here for allowing myself to think stupid thoughts. This woman chose me, and I love her. But is it too much to ask that I'm made aware of when she needs breathing space from the world? Otherwise, I just feel like I'm not important enough.",1556558814

I prefer INTJ since they think and make a decision. My best friend is INTJ and said I have no intuition, too emotional, and too extrovert. He said I might be ESFP or ESFJ. What do you think?

So here are a few things about me:

1. I am not logical at all.
2. I have no intution.
3. I react emotionally.
4. I take things personally.
5. I lack tact.
6. I dont understand emotions yet my reactions are emotional.
7. I want others to get to the point as I cant process whatever they say.
8. I am not big of details. Even at work either I cannot grasp the details or they dont interest me.
9. I cannot process playing games even at work to dating. I dont understand them.
10. I react vs think.
11. I like socializing but pick on peoples vibe at times for example if they are they type of person who are passive aggressive I just avoid them or play dumb.
12. I love fashion.
13. I am too emotional.
14. I am too open book where strangers have told me dont be too open.
15. I make friends easily but my emotions sabotage them.
16. I take jokes very personally.
17. I lash out when someone makes fun of me.
18. I do not get people being sarcastic or bantering. I take it personally.
19. I want to be myself and at work it is hard since everyone has an angle at corporate america.
20. I am an Aries.
21. I get my feelings hurt very very easily.
22. I take everything very personally.
23. My family says I am annoying while to me Im just messing with them since they are so quiet.
24. I prefer women that are logical and details so I dont have to worry about details.
25. I cannot have facebook, twitter, or social media since I am too open and too emotional.
26. I like socializing but with everyone playing an angle I just keep to myself. This is where my emotions kick in and I start thinking everyone is planning against me.
27. I cannot stand the heat or beach. I prefer air conditioned.

I used to get ISTJ. My INFP childhood friend said I am ISTJ, like good will hunting matt damon. Problem is I hate details. I want someone else to have responsibility of following rules. I thought I was an INTJ. My INTJ best friend is very patient and his mind is like 50 cent. I react emotionally to things and take things very very personally.

I can not be with estp for too long, bc if they like you, they bust ur balls. When that happens, I take it as a personal threat. Most times I dont get the joke.

Even in dating, women at times will start busting balls, when they like the guy. They begin to notice I am taking it personally. I just walk away. To me, if I am not busting ur balls than why are you busting my balls.

I relate a lot to Ne but people have told me I'm very good at noticing details in my environment which they don't usually notice.

I'm always up for discussing weird hypothetical scenarios though, unlike how stereo-typically sensors are portrayed. &lt;-- my major reason I think I'm an INFP - could be wrong tho.

I love going on spontaneous adventures, but I've seen the same in most INFPs I know. My main hobby is photography, so travelling gives me chance to take pictures of so many different landscapes.

He just asked that fucking questions for literally every fucking day, my parents and relatives answered patiently like:"" he have studied abroad"", and it repeated every day.Despite of living in a different house for a fucking decade, he still told the same to ask my parents to eat dinner for every fucking nights. I used to answered very impolite like:"" he have already gone"" ""That is none of your business"" Moreover, he just interrupted things.

isfp,"So for the past few months we've been training for a tournament for a sport called ""captain ball"". And on our most recent training I had a mental breakdown. I'm the captain of the team and for the past few months I was handling all the stress that comes from being a captain pretty well. It has never passed by limit but I always been so close to exploding due to amount of times I've been hurt emotionally by my teammates not caring or fully relying on me to give them the support or motivation. On that recent training, my girlfriend and I had a heated argument before it and because of that I couldnt get my mind off it during training. I couldn't focus on the game at all and as a team captain, I couldn't do my job to guide my team. I passed my emotionally limit and I exploded (exploded internally :( ofc). I ran off from the field to one far corner behind a bush and I sat their for around 2 hours crying non-stop and couldn't stop but just feel so helpless. I wanted to be alone for as long as I could and I didn't want anyone to see how useless and emotional I was being.

But I really wanted some sort of support, some sort of understanding from my team that the job I've been doing has come with so much sacrifices. I wanted some kind of return or just someone to tell me I did a good job. In the end a few or them messaged me after the training and it did really help make me feel better but not entirely. The fact that only 2 out of 13 really seemed like they cared about how I feel, I start to question myself if this even worth it ? Giving my blood, sweat and tears for people. Just being there for each of them and trying my best to make them feel their best so they can give it their all for each training we have. I feel like I have just been stepped over and been taken advantage of. Doing so much for people that barely care for how I feel and think I'm overreacting. It just feels unfair and worthless. The tournament is in a week and we will have our last training in 2 days. 

How do I go back to them after me being their team captain ran off and left them during training, feeling so demotivated to play the game and just feel confident as the team captain again ? I just don't feel like I'm capable anymore. I feel like just running away from all of this and not face it. The fear of being emotionally hurt again is stopping me from doing it.

isfp,"TL DR; my ISFP husband of 13 years is extremely depressed about his situation. How can I help him through his depression and help him find happiness for him?

Hi all. I'm desperate. I've been married to my ISFP husband for 13 years (I'm an INFP). He's amazing. He's funny as hell, he's cute, he's smart, our sex life is spot on, he's creative and I love being around him. 

Through the years we've both been through a lot. Our first child was stillborn, we've had two since then and they both have severe special needs (they're both on the autism spectrum. Both have severe communication issues). I think this has broken him. Our kids are work, that's no lie. It is a hard, and sometimes sleepless, job. I'm a SAHM and he is a dentist and has started his own business recently. It has been an understandably stressful time for him and it has put a strain on our marriage. 

Details of our marriage would take an eternity, so I'll skip it. We've both fucked up plenty of times. At this point I'm done with he said/she said details. My husband is so extremely depressed that he's gained 100lbs, smokes weed and plays video games any chance he can get and if he's not doing that then he's trying to have endless sex with me. He also avoids the children as much as he can and he resents them heavily (especially my oldest son who is completely non-verbal and a bit more of a challenge at times). I want my husband to be happy. He blames me and the kids for his lack of happiness and I've been killing myself to fix our marriage. 

I confronted him about his depression. I don't know if that was the right move, but I've been a verbal punching bag for years and he recently told me to just deal with it, and I don't want to stand for that, but I also want to help him. He's such a wonderful person and I've seen this depression consume him. He has expressed feeling trapped and wanting more freedom, but when I suggest he go out, he finds reasons to stay home and do more of the same and then blames me for being a homebody. He has also said he doesn't want to leave me with the kids and I have told him over and over to not worry about me and that I can handle the children if it means he can have time for himself to be human. 

How can I help him get out and be a human? I have signed him up for therapy and he only went once. I have found info on hobbies he's interested in and he won't do them. He knows he's depressed. He knows he has to do something about it. His anxiety is intense and he's very self conscious about his weight in regards to doing some of the hobbies he would normally like to do, which is a feeling I understand. 

Help me. I can't get him to do anything without basically making it an ultimatum, which is a terrible thing to do! I know people will say counseling, but what else can I do? I have basically thrown myself off a cliff trying to tell him that I love him and I want him to feel free and to do things for him and be happy, etc. I've ordered him to go take breaks, etc. I have supported him in all of this, but this depression is mind numbing and confusing and I don't want to fuck up anymore and quite honestly my kids don't deserve this. My oldest is 9 years old, this is a resentment that has not let up or gone away. I want him to get over it and love our kids.

isfp,"Do you find ISFPs have difficulty apologizing for something they did wrong? 

As an ISFP I often have that difficulty, but not because I think I never do anything wrong or that I'm not sorry for doing something wrong, but because I'm so in the moment that I have a hard time putting myself in the mindset of when I committed the fault in question. And this matters because I am also oriented towards authenticity and if I'm not in that mindset I can't feel the wrong I did to apologize and authentically mean it. 

However if the wrongdoing is caught right away when I'm still in the mindset that was behind the wrongdoing, I can fairly easily apologize.

Reading articles about Introverts, it dawned on me he's most likely an ISFP. I never try to type people, it just kinda happened as I read the info about the ISFP (you guys are totally precious, btw). 

Anyway, our meetings were going great. Hanging out was cool with no pressure, sex and making out were like whoa. But a few times I would bring up doing stuff out and about - going to a gallery crawl, drinks off the beaten path. Things I thought might interest him (he's into art). He'd say yes, however plans fell through every time, usually the day of.

Being a mature adult, I took a hint. It wasn't the end of the world for me if he wanted to keep it purely casual. But I wanted to be sure and he's one worth trying. I also thought maybe he did really like me, but maybe this is an ISFP thing that I totally misrepresented. It's just when he kisses me I feel like he's really into me (I can't kiss someone I feel ""meh"" about, much less make out with them for hours). I can tell he's genuinely thoughtful and kind. He's comforted me when I felt bad about something even if it was something small. Like how could I not fall for this guy.

Anyway, I needed to know if I should maybe try to keep some emotional distance because I realized I was falling for him. I asked, over text, if I should stop asking about doing something (besides hanging out at his place). I said either way was fine, just didn't want to keep bothering him with invites if he just wasn't into it. He answered ""we'll talk later"".

I don't know what to make of this. I was trying to not put him on the spot, thus texting instead of asking him face-to-face. But the ambiguous response is baffling me. I can't tell if he means it and we will hang out again or if he's just letting me down softly to try to spare my feelings. 

I haven't answered, it's been about 5 days. Usually we only text if we're making plans to see each other, but at this point I don't know what to do.

I'm having a hard time finding good summer pants, but regular cotton chinos are fine and I wear those a lot. during the colder months I basically wear the same stuff, just long sleeved shirts and don't wear shorts much. for shoes I like leather/suede boots a lot, but when I wear shorts I usually go with more minimal sneakers(like converse, white leather sneakers) or new balance(the designs definitely grew on me and the comfort is great) if the rest of the outfit is more plain

I don't know if I'd say my fashion sense is super bold, but sometimes it can be different. it's fun to wear more unusual stuff like light pink pants and interesting prints rather than going for more normal colors and designs. at the same time though i still appreciate minimalism and like wearing very simple stuff too, depends what I'm doing I guess. especially at home or the gym I'm usually just wearing t-shirts or tank tops and sweatpants/shorts or something, but I usually try to keep the color coordination in order(unless my clothes are all dirty, then I'll just wear whatever's clean). 

Just curious what other people like to wear and what they think about fashion in general. I'll be honest growing up I just wore whatever, then a few years ago I decided I should start wearing stuff I like and have found it really fun since then. I would love to design my own stuff at some point",1555380618

I wrote, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take it by the library today, no big deal.‚Äù and hit send as my husband (ISTP) is in the background telling me to write ‚Äúno problem, thank you.‚Äù I figured my response was close enough to what he said anyway, who cares right?

She almost immediately responds ‚ÄúGreat, I'll return his extra jersey to his coach for you.‚Äù

But the ISTP jumps out of bed screaming about how I‚Äôve pissed this girl off and now she‚Äôs going to mistreat our kids based on my ‚Äúbitchy‚Äù reaction to her.

isfp,"Imo ExTJs are in a way some of the weirdest types to me, in terms of my relation to them. Very much a love/hate thing. 

To start off, I generally get along very well with IxTJs. However, ExTJs generally have a completely different vibe to them, and in many cases they come across as pretty intimidating (however in a different way than ExTPs). When they're healthy people I generally find them pretty cool, but when they're not they usually (ENTJs in particular) seem to subscribe to a rather narcissistic and elitist way of thinking, like ""man the world would be better off without dumb feelers and sensors, thinkers and intuitives, I salute you"", and they can be pretty crass.

The inferior Fi is also a bit of a bait and switch, initially I'm like ""oh neat, Fi users"", but irl it's kinda absent in them. From what I've read it's very similar to Fi in ExTPs, although still seems different from outside. The healthy ones are more skilled at it, though.

I've also seen quite a few ExTJs irl, and they've always been extremes. One (ESTJ) was a bit of a smooth, narcissistic, manipulating jerk, another (ESTJ teacher) was a total psychopath who imposed almost rules in an almost fascist way, and I know I've seen other ExTJs who were really cool and nice, basically behaved more like socially confident IxTJs.",1555079073

My answers to it changed three times in my life, and I know I'm more likely to sacrifice myself in real life situation. [Study result](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797617752640) show that responses to hypothetical dilemmas are not predictive of real-life dilemma behavior, so feel free to give away your opinion and reasons. I list core values and stuff, but you could replace them(but tell me what you replace them with) since it's your answer. And I apologize if I worded some sentence awkwardly, and for all the grammar errors. Feel free to ask me to clarify if you're unsure of anything. I hope you enjoy playing with this. 

&amp;#x200B;

Your core value prerequisites: 

* Honesty
* Sincerity
* Justice
* Acceptance
* Commitment
* Order

&amp;#x200B;

Some of your core values:

* Discretion and Diligence.
* Independence and Camaraderie.
* Reasonable and Contribution.

&amp;#x200B;

Your beliefs:

YOLO, live the life you won't regret. Always put on your own mask first to help others. 

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone's a defect in their own way at a different level. If y'all are crystals, you and your friends are all intrinsic defects(sometimes it's a vacancy, and sometimes it's interstitials). There's this one entity that you and your friend wanted to be a part of since y'all are in kindergarten. This entity hates your kind of defect and disallows y'all to be a part of it. You just found out your friend broke the rule of this entity in order to be a part of this entity by omitting his defect. It's not his fault he has this certain kind of defect. You know he doesn't have any malicious intention in breaking the rule, and he either had to break the rule or give up his dream. You don't question his moral decision because you know his reasons and circumstances *(camaraderie, reasonable, YOLO)*. Knowing you could get serious punishment, you decided to keep his secret because you believe that he did well for this entity *(Discretion, contribution, camaraderie)*, and you believed him when he opens up to you about how much he put extra efforts to make up for his lie*(diligence, reasonable, camaraderie)*. Luckily, your friend has completed his dream and has since moved on to the next chapter of his life. 

&amp;#x200B;

The problem now is, you want to do just like your friend. No excuse, but you learned that there are many different defects(even your kind!) lied their way into the network of the entity, and most of them never got caught/perform well. You already have a 6 years plan and 10 years plan for personal and professional goals. But you're willing to postpone your plans for this because of YOLO, and you're sure you will regret not trying this first. You're okay with lying this entity because you only have two options and you know which one you will be choosing. You're confident you will perform well just like your friend and other defects who lied their way into the network of this entity. Keeping a secret is one of your natural talents, but you will never keep secret with your loved ones. And you know you don't want to put your loved ones in an ethical dilemma situation because they have to report you to the entity if they find out. What would you do, ad why?",1555044978

&amp;#x200B;

Reading and thinking about MBTI gives me the feeling that I'm consuming my time. Constantly analyzing myself and thinking about my personality and that of others.

&amp;#x200B;

I always had a problem trying to find out what's my type. Lately, I wrote some articles about cognitive functions, and I had to read many articles to be able to explain the functions with my own words, but almost none of the descriptions that I read said something specific and conclusive of cognitives functions.

&amp;#x200B;

For that same reason, the descriptions of the 16 types become kinda futile. I still don't know for sure what my type is. INFP, ISFP, could even be ISFJ. Enneagram 461, 641, or some other.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't like my article, nor anyone else's. I realized that none leaves you with something in your hands. There is nothing you can grab. There are many people in this community who can't find their type either. This is only possible with a bad system. There are people who profit from this, but even among professionals there are disagreements.

isfp,"I‚Äôm adding this here because I realised this kinda turned into a rant about my ex lmao. Promise I‚Äôm alright, I just kinda rambled on a bit :) feel free to ignore and write your answers below!

I ask the second question specifically because I‚Äôm pretty sure my most recent ex was an ExTP. More likely ENTP. I‚Äôm not entirely sure, but I‚Äôm pretty sure. I‚Äôm trying to type off of my vague memory since the last time we spoke over half a year ago haha. 

Reasons I think she is - she had a very unique, slightly dark sense of humour. I weirdly liked that about her. I would even class her as ‚Äúquirky‚Äù - but the hot kind. You know what I mean.. it‚Äôs like she had this unique personality no one else really did. I‚Äôve still never found anyone similar to her. She was very bubbly and loud; which did slightly annoy me. She also didn‚Äôt seem that open with her feelings. I (kind of..) felt loved for the most part, but she didn‚Äôt really show that. She was affectionate, but mainly physically. Infact the way she showed love was usually playfully. Teasing jokes perhaps. I found it enjoyable. She was also generally super attractive. We never really shared any feelings. Our conversations didn‚Äôt particularly have that tone.

She talked a lottt, particularly about herself. I was fairly happy to listen though. But it did get on my nerves when she went on. Especially if she was super loud and obnoxious in public. I‚Äôd silently cringe as I knew everyone around us was probably annoyed. She is also an aspiring lawyer; which I think is a fitting career. 

Anyway, we spent a year and a half together. To this day my best relationship and I‚Äôm extremely grateful for the time I spent with her. It ended fairly smoothly; however she didn‚Äôt really seem bothered when I ended it. Infact; it was me who was doing all the missing and wanting her back even tho I ended it lmao. But I just didn‚Äôt feel as loved, and I didn‚Äôt feel as much meaning. 

I still don‚Äôt quite know why I ended it. It‚Äôs like - the relationship was conventionally great. Never argued. But I just wasn‚Äôt happy enough. I wasn‚Äôt unhappy, it just didn‚Äôt feel, right. The only reason I could give for ending it was a gut feeling I had. Turns out right after breaking up she moved onto someone else pretty quickly so hey, perhaps I was right!

Works well enough. Online they're a bigger problem, but I find that just ignoring them is for the best, since from what I understand they thrive on attention (tert Fe).

Unhealthy ESTPs are the opposite. Online they're relatively easy to deal with since they don't bite as hard with words as ENTPs do, but damn irl they're easily the worst kind of organism you can encounter. You know them, for example the group of high school kids who bike past you, shout ""faggot"" or something similar at you and then laugh like a total douchebag. Very aggressive, confrontational people. They're really hard to ignore, because if you do they tend to resort to physical acts, like blocking your way, throwing stuff at you, shouting, etc. Really, is there anything you can do with them? I haven't figured it out.

For things like minimalism, exercise, sleep, personality type, I always seem to go on these research binges where I'll learn a whole bunch about a topic then whittle it down to what practically suits me best. I'm about to start this journey with food now. I see a lot of contradictory information and a lot of warning and caution on foods to eat, how to cook, what to cook in, etc, and it's all such a mess I can't just take anyone's word for it.

Is this Ti? Or is this: I'm about to gather a lot of Se data from Te sources and will hopefully Ni narrow it down to find what Fi suits me best. 

These information binges always confuse me regarding me type. The thing is I don't care so much about how the biology of all these minerals etc work, I trust the Te to tell me that, but I will take lots of sources and kind of average them out. If an issue is very popular (e.g. aluminium being toxic) and practical enough for me to adjust my lifestyle to, I'll trust it. But if there's only a few sources for it I'll just think it's some nutjob catastrophising shit and move on. Once I have a broad picture of all the stuff that people are saying, I will select what suits me practically, based on what I know I enjoy and wouldn't mind doing or can make something nice out of (even just getting new minimalist cookware which excites me). I know I already prefer healthy foods but it's also a source of stress because I don't want to put bad stuff in my body which is why I've been putting off learning about it.

However, like an ITP/IJ even, I have systems for everything, from the way my room is organised to the way I plan my week or deal with new information, although these things are usually very flexible and based on how I feel at the time. I try to discard anything I don't need straight away. My room never gets messy now, save for a few clothes when I'm distracted by my Ni world. It used to be a nightmare but it's taken years to whittle it all down to a system that ensures I never have to deal with P messes anymore and I can spend more time on what I really Fi value (like being out in nature, spending time with others, trying new things, etc).",1554509075

Recently I found a low key way to relax, which was doing these intricate, highly detailed coloring books with paint pens while listening to the BBC. I could also do it while killing time in other places: doctors‚Äô office waiting rooms, long car rides, while watching my kids in the playroom, etc.

So this girl, who is an ISFP, doesn't talk to anyone at work and only talks to me even when other guys are there. We hit it off and go real deep in conversations every single time. She opens up to me about secrets going on in her family and I open up about mine to hers. However, I did notice her mood does change when ever she brings up her real thoughts and feelings and she doesn't like talking about them.

However, all of this is in person. She never texts me after work, unless its about a shift or if its me texting her, then she'll take a while to reply. And when she does reply its never to carry on the conversation, but rather only answers the question.

I am so confused now, at work we talk all day, talk about real deep shit like our feelings and what troubles us, but once work is over she goes home and its all forgotten.  

So is she into me? I'm worred about asking her out because I'm afraid the feelings aren't mutual. I do like her, but I am so confused. I am an ENFP male.",1553752139

She blows up at me in the restaurant, ""what do you think is wrong?"" Wtf?

This is often the case with many of my relationships (my siblings being almost the only exception), I get along with them super well, have fun and then get pulled into a long term thing where things happen and it becomes complicated and takes a lot of time to solve, and there's never enough time for just enjoying things in the moment. I just wish my friendships were... simpler. At least a bit. At least right now. I don't even know why I keep attracting these kind of relationships, I just like the people I guess. But ultimately, I feel like my life goal at this point is to settle in a somewhat remote residence with beautiful surroundings where I can find peace and and some time to myself, and to act somewhat like a 'lone wanderer': doing freelance work maybe, creating artworks in places, helping people etc. This would be the ideal life in my vision.

TL;DR I hate being tied down in my relationships. 

I guess this isn't really a DAE, as I don't know whether other ISFPs relate, nor do I think it matters if they (you guys) do. I think everyone here may want different things from their lives. Thanks for reading anyways. ",1553728001

isfp,"I took the test about two or so years ago. I got ISFP. So I brewed on it for a while, and eventually decided I would see what the deal with MBTI was on Reddit. That was a few months back. I had been posting and lurking and whatnot for about a month when I had my doubts that I fit in with you guys. So naturally I retook the test. ISFP again. I decided to read through the entire passage the website has. It was fairly accurate about how I see myself.

I put an end to the doubts, and just continued on as normal. About another month passed, and I realized again I didn't seem to fit in naturally here. I can't really put my finger on what seemed off either. Another thing that got my mind on it was seeing what people from anime were typed as. I would see characters typed ISFP that I thought weren't anything like me. I assumed it to be mistyping the character. So I continued to look into it. The typing appeared consistent on most of the characters I came across. So I decided the only thing that made sense was that I was mistyped.

I decided to take the test through a different source. I got ISTP with this source. I thought it wasn't too weird that a letter would change, and I decided to go read the passage on the ISTP. I am flabbergasted how accurate it sounded. I had heard so many accounts of people being surprised just how accurate their MBTI profile was, and I never really saw the hype. It was because I was reading the wrong one.

I went back to tumblr and pinterest to see those things where it lists every type with some stupid statement. I had never thought those were accurate. I had also been skimming them for ISFP and INTJ (My two best friends are INTJ's) So I decided to go through and see what those had written for ISTP's. Once again was a little surprised how accurate some of it was. It was still trashy like I expected, but it was much much more accurate.

I went on to read the ISTP subreddit for a few days now, and like wow. It is so much more relatable. Honestly I feel stupid. I had been performing some mental gymnastics to draw similarities in everything I read here and myself. I didn't have to stretch too far, but I did have to stretch. The main difference is that I am not artistic in the slightest. I can mimic what other people do quite well, and had stretched to believe I was artistic in some manner. That, however, isn't artistic at all. Thats pretty mechanical. Do this, do this, do this, and bam you have art. That isn't art. I'm not an artist. I'm not an adventurer.

The more I ask, the more inclined they are to feel stuck and run away into their solitude. Any thoughts? ",1553463089
isfp,,1553451756
isfp," like  a lot of people, I don't know what descriptions mean when they talk  about ""living in the moment"" and ""aware of the environment"", but I saw a lot of ISFPs and a couple of INFPs to differentiate between them, and I  noticed that:

&amp;#x200B;

ISFPs usually are into certain physical activities. They are the ones who are more likely to **enjoy**  exercising manual skills. things like art crafts, mechanical repairing  of something, cutting hair, etc. Not only ISFPs, but also my ISTP  brother is better than me at drawing, although he never practiced and I  do it for years.

&amp;#x200B;

According  to what I saw: ISFPs tend to be inclined to the more artistic side of  manual skills, like (painting, drawing, singing) while ISTPs tend to go  towards the ""puzzle side"" of manual skills, something you can ""solve"",  like building a chair, repairing a computer, fixing a clock, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

But, there are common territories to ISFPs and ISTPs. That is, they have some **manual ability potential**:  I know a lot of ISFPs and a some ISTPs. An ISFP friend of mine is good  repairing his bike and knows a lot of it. an ISTP acquaintance is  studying painting. Maybe it's not that they have skill, but that they **are more interested in those activities**. So they become better at some point.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, what I could see about INFPs and ISFPs in real life give me some hints. **This can be subjective and insufficient**.  I have little experience gathered, but what I see is that INFPs seem  more inclined to the SP instinctual variant, while ISFPs tend to be more  open to the people, talks, world. Honestly, INFPs I know may look a  little like INTJs, they could even look like thinkers at first glance,  while ISFPs may look warmer, less distant, and less quiet. Remember that  this is only **my subjetive opinion, based on what little I saw.**

&amp;#x200B;

Another  thing I would like to say. INFPs and ISFPs can look really good if they  can choose what to wear. But there is a thin and not always clear  dividing line. The difference may be that, ISTPs and ISFPs may have some  more ""visual power"". That is to say that they might look good for  aesthetics. The problem here is that Fi ruins this claim. Fi may have  its own fashion. ISFPs may look aesthetically bad if they want to get  it. Let's say that, ISFPs can look better and worse than INFPs can. It  depends on what the ISFP want to transmit.

&amp;#x200B;

Instead, INFPs may seem like a little more indifferent to clothes. Male INFPs are more prone to ""*wear so you do not go naked""* style (my personal and patented style ‚Ñ¢)*.* **Both can wear the same**. just an example: while ISFPs wear cyberpunk because ""*I look good, I'm brave, cool*"", INFP wear cyberpunk becase ""*I come from a war, I narrate what I am inside with my clothes*"". and that's why ISFPs may vary more the clothes they wear. I have an ISFP acquaintance that **always** looks well. one day she looks like a hippie, the other day like a cyberpunk, the other day she wears very formal.

&amp;#x200B;

and  also, in art, ISFPs tend to make art going more to the aesthetic. what  it mean? they are the ones who are more likely to have ""cool drawings""  about monsters or insects or beautiful persons, and things like that.  they are more capable to appreciate the visual thing as something  complete in itself. While INFPs usually support their ideas in sensory  ways. I myself see drawing as a mean to convey an idea. I see it as an  accessory, not as the main thing of my creation.

&amp;#x200B;

I  would never dedicate myself to draw a 1 hour drawing just to finish  with a ""cool drawing"" that doesn't tell anything, or that doesn't  represents anything about me. but I saw many ISFPs that draw much more  beautiful things than mine, with better technique, and much better than  mine, without another message that ""I am a cute drawing"".

&amp;#x200B;

comparing  myself INFP with an ISFP friend. We both study visual arts. My drawings  have a narrative context that manifests itself visually. I narrate a  little story about someone or something. I get involved with internal  questions and philosophical doubts. When my ISFP friend want's to give a  meaning to his drawings, he usually takes a metaphor of some of the  songs he likes and draws it. If the song is called ""the shadows that  drown me"", he draw a shadow drowning someone. And he does it well.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 [Fredrikhellstorm](https://www.reddit.com/user/Fredrikhellstorm) added:

In  my experience Isfps seem to be really talented visually, while not as  much when it comes to language. While Infps like me seem to be the other  way around. For example the two Isfps I know closest (and who I  actually dare to type) are both super talented in art. Interestingly one  makes art in 3d animation software, and the other one designs  furniture. Both things that probably requires great spatial skills. For  me though (and now I‚Äôm speaking mostly from my personal perspective) I  really do suck at drawing. I can‚Äôt get proportions right, and depth is  lacking. However I‚Äôve been told I‚Äôm gifted in language. At the same time  one of the isfps I know has dyslexia. Not true for the other one, but  he doesn‚Äôt really seem to have an affinity for grammatics either.

&amp;#x200B;

I  could go on with this, but it‚Äôs mostly speculation. Really interesting  though, since there‚Äôs such a common stereotype of isfps as typical  artists, while there‚Äôs quite many famous infp writers to name.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, a theory of mine. I shouldn‚Äôt be writing stuff like this at 3 am. But I do like writing lol...

Hey fellow ISFP‚Äôs

Just thought I could share this with you because it kind of bothers me and I sometimes question my identity because of it.

I‚Äôm having a hard time trying to find the right words because my English is not the best...blablabla but I try my best. Feel free to correct me :D

It‚Äôs just that, when I think something or someone‚Äòs behavior is cool (in my own and unique perception of ‚Äûcool‚Äú ) I kind of adopt it.

Maybe some examples are helpful‚Ä¶

&amp;#x200B;

1) When I first watched the movie Harry Potter and the chamber of secrets I thought it was cool that Ron is such afraid of spiders and so I talked myself into fearing spiders although I actually thought they were kinda funny / interesting. Ever since that I indeed was afraid of spiders... Until that day two years ago when I realized that ticks are much scarier‚Ä¶but I was afraid of spiders for 10 years because of a movie!! That‚Äôs not normal... or is it?

&amp;#x200B;

2)  I‚Äôve never been into science fiction / superheroes or other geeky stuff like that until an ex of my sister tried to persuade her into watching Star Wars with him and I thought ‚Äúhey, most girls don‚Äôt like that stuff, let‚Äôs give it a try, I wanna be cool, I wanna be different‚Äù. 

Before that I was one of those who said Star Wars and Star Trek is the same thing and actually thought that all of this stuff was stupid. After watching Star Wars for the first time I still thought it was stupid but I was able to talk myself into loving it, re-watching it three or four times and now I can proudly say I own (among a lot of others) all the Star Wars movies on blu-ray (and a huge collection of comics etc.) and I‚Äôd like to punch people in the face who say Star Trek and Star Wars is the same thing. There is nothing better than discussing with my boyfriend in what order we watch the movies.

These are just examples, I‚Äôm trying to say I love stuff like that now and I know more about it than the average ‚ÄúI like Marvel because everybody is into it now‚Äù person.

&amp;#x200B;

3) Memoirs of a Geisha is one of my favourite movies and I fell in love with the culture of Japan. When I first tried sushi I gagged because it was such an awful taste and I really couldn‚Äôt swallow a bit of it. But I said to myself ‚Äúyou are a japan-fan, you must love sushi‚Äù (which is bullshit, I know) and I tried again and again and by this time I love sushi.

Maybe that‚Äôs not the best example to explain what I mean but it also describes how intensively I can talk myself into something.

&amp;#x200B;

I could give you more examples but this is already a pretty long text and I think you already get what I‚Äôm trying to say.

The question that bothers me regarding all this is ‚Äúam I truly authentic?‚Äù

isfp,"Disclaimer: Im fairly new to MBIT, i test INTP and over the last few years i have been working on (what turned out to be) my inferior Fe function. I asked her to take the test and she got ISFP, so AFAIK she‚Äôs only taken in once. 

Backstory: We‚Äôve known each other online for 8 years now. First 2-3 years we were inseparable best friends. Then we had a falling out due to feelings getting involved, high IRL stress on both sides, and us just having very opposite functions while being young and immature about it. 
Last 5 or so years we‚Äôve been through varying degrees of closeness. 

We‚Äôve slowly been talking more and getting closer again over the last year but honestly things are still just a shadow of how we used to be, and we both feel that and hate it. We‚Äôve both expressed to each other that we miss each other and how close we used to be. But then that's it, there's no talk about what we want to do to fix that nor do we actually do anything. 

She‚Äôs been going through some hard times IRL and i want to be there and be supportive for her. Even though im trash at it, Ive been trying my best through the limited communication we do have (text/snapchat). To be honest though it feels kinda off, forced and not ‚Äúnormal‚Äù for us. It feels scripted and like its what we should be saying to each other. Our ‚Äústyle or rapport‚Äù feels like its rarely there.

We used to play tons of video games together and skype call for hours to spend time with each other. Problem is i have weird feelings about both those things atm. 

Video game wise i just came out of a pretty long depression where i used video games as a huge crutch. My competitiveness took a lot of the fun out of video games and i found myself feel more angry than relaxed.  I still love them, just been pretty burnt out. Especially multiplayer games. 

When it comes to voice/video chat, its just something im very nervous and awkward about. Last time we had a falling out a couple years ago, one of the last straws before we fell out was her standing me up on a couple phone calls we planned. On top of that she tends to distance herself whenever theres a lot of emotion going between us ( she denies this lol). Especially if accompanied by other IRL factors causing high stress. A general pattern i noticed over the years is high emotions + high stress = distancing 

TL;DR Im trying to reconnect with a long time ISFP friend/crush but im having a hard time due to fear of repeating past patterns. I want to continue to be supportive while shes going through current IRL issues but we both also both miss each other and want to be closer. 

Any tips on how to go about this? What can i ask, or how do i go about asking it so we can both understand each other better, in order to accomplish these things? ",1553238187

Constantly thinking about this is the real problem. I just need to breathe.‚Äù

This is actually how I first started to get into meditating. After a while, my mind is more clear, and I‚Äôm start feeling like myself again. I often practice mindfulness through playing various instruments (whatever one I‚Äôm feeling at the time) or drawing. Does anyone else do this? 

I‚Äôm also very invested in yoga. It‚Äôs another mindfulness practice that has helped me when I‚Äôm stressed.

isfp,"When I overthink, I begin to believe that things no longer have any value or meaning. For example, I think, ""what is the point of working?"" Yeah, it makes money and keeps me alive, but it sucks. I feel like a slave. I'm stuck in this system. I'm trapped. I'm gonna work until I'm old and then die. 

Living in the present comes naturally to me. The difficult thing about this is when you start to overthink, then I am living in overthinking land. And I can't stop stressing, worrying and making myself depressed and angry. You would think that someone that lives in the present wouldn't be prone to overthinking, but everyone is different. Also, being a feeler makes overthinking even more struggling. You feel all the negative emotions and really feel trapped. Sometimes it can get so bad that you think whether ending it all would be a good idea. Or worse, the only option.

Depression, anxiety and overthinking are all related. It's important to practice gratitude, meditate, ground yourself and focus on the positives. 

Maybe working at a job that you don't like isn't all that bad. You can find another job if you hate it that badly. Also, no job will ever be 100% perfect. There will always be something that you don't like about it. Or someone. 

Learn to accept things that you can't change. Be it family, the system that we live in, your personality, people's beliefs, etc.

Everything is either a blessing or a lesson. If something keeps haunting you, it means that you haven't learned to accept it. For example, I'm stuck living with my Mom and I dislike her negative energy and the drama that she causes. I desire to be in solitude, but I am too lazy and anxious to find a job and my own place. Things will keep reoccurring in your life, until you solve them. You can't run away forever.

The reason I have felt so conflicted for so long is because I never understood that I need to take a mix and match approach to making decisions with these. The reason I could never stick to one set of values is because each one doesn't apply to everything. In different situations, different things are important. I've never really been able to make sense of my opinions because of this.

isfp,"How do you guys relate having primary Fi and inferior Te? I find that it fits me well, Both in good and bad ways...

With Fi as the lead function one's cognitive priority is decisions on their own values/morals. Some would also add emotions though from what I've seen the feeling functions are largely/mostly based on values. While Te, Which is making decisions on the reasons/logic of others being lowest as the inferior function.

I've noticed some people associating unhealthy IXFP with going into these weird individualistic me vs the world types of mentalities, Usually the INFP I've seen be associated with this behavior though I'd imagine it's also applicable to ISFP as it's based on the presence of lead Fi/Inferior Te. Which both types use.

I've definitely noticed this in myself, I've often been some crazy ""individuality over all else"" type of person and would kind of isolate myself from other people. Largely in fear of being controlled or hurt. I was almost misanthropic in a sense... Has anyone else gone through something similar?

On a more positive note though I've also seen people associate the Fi with things like integrity or a desire to be a decent person. So I guess that's also a thing. And of course, Lead Fi making it pretty easy for us to know what we like or what we want. I imagine this could be even moreso for the ISFP as they have Se, Which gathers the known facts/knowledge where from what I understand Ne with the INFP would be more likely to idealize something as opposed to taking more practical approach.

ExFJs seem to give off a ""you're dead to me"" kinda vibe if you do anything wrong, and it's also like they truly don't care about anything from within, it's kinda like they're just doing an act or something to get accepted.

IxFJs (especially INFJs) seem to take Fi not seriously at all, like sometimes when you mean something and talk about something passionately, they're just sitting there with their eyes closed and grinning, as if they're saying ""haha, so funny, these people"". It's incredibly patronizing in a way.

ExTPs are to me the worst of the bunch (since I'm speaking as an ISFP, of course), they seem to take a very... systematic approach to Fe, from my experience. It's kinda like they keep regurgitating a manual containing instructions on how to be seen as normal and caring, and really artificially apply that to other people (constantly trying to be nice in a bit of an awkward way, constantly justifying everything with ""I did it for the others"", caring only about the tribe but never themselves), it's kinda like how extremely religious people basically take every word from the Bible and apply it to life, perhaps without even thinking about it themselves, they just do it. But the worst part is definitely when they're unhealthy and get all aggressive on you, and use Fe to gauge your reaction to their attacks, as a form of amusement.

IxTPs are probably the easiest to handle out of this list since they have inferior Fe. I do find it really annoying that even though they don't use Fe often, sometimes it does pop up and it becomes basically a very mild version of the ExTP's Fe.

Happened with a guy I've been talking to, I just felt like he wouldn't be real with me so I said my bye byes. Suddenly he gets real asking what happened. I straight up told him I was bored. In truth I was frustrated and tired and understimulated and just not having it. Well he asked me out pretty soon after that, no more games or playing coy.

I think people really don't value each other. Just feeding each other fake bullshit to protect themselves. If there's one thing I can appreciate about ISFPs it's that we seek what's real and if it's real, we don't judge it, we respect the balls on someone who can be candid and we respect human nature. In fact without the real we *wither*. You can feel it in the exhaustion and frustration that seems to come from nowhere. I mean when something is manufactured it isn't emotionally stimulating and we can feel it it's so transparent. How dissociated do you have to be to get used to that. We shouldn't have to get used to that lifeless bullshit nor should we waste our energy on what doesn't give us life. 

Sorry but I'm just not coping with that for anyone anymore. Life is too short to waste energy on what doesn't nourish you.

I mostly base this off of his music. Ever since he rose to fame I felt that, when he‚Äôs good *he‚Äôs really fucking good* but then, when he goes into cringe-lord mode and starts writing those angry songs about whoring around and shaming girls who dissed him...well...it just reeks of embarrassing Fi/Se outbursts and toxic masculinity.

So, a couple weeks back I was in English class, when we had a mock exam. There was two options for this writing paper; description of a given picture, or a ‚Äústory where something unexpected happens‚Äù . I thought a bit, until I had this idea and wrote about two people on a them park ride gone awry. 

Anyway, I finished the paper but wasn‚Äôt massively happy with it. I thought it was decent, but nothing special. Fast forward to a couple weeks later, and my teacher absolutely loves it. Top marks. I‚Äôm not sure why, and honestly the compliments fell on deaf ears. Still, it was nice to hear. She read it out to the class as i sat there surprisingly uncomfortable. It was a nice gesture but god, I felt I was shrivelling up in my seat.

She finishes the story, I receive compliments and whatever. Mainly glad it‚Äôs over. But then she asks a question. She comes out with ‚Äúso, what was going through your head when you wrote this?‚Äù And I just froze. Not out of anxiety, but genuine confusion. What was going through my head? I sat for a few moments, saying nothing. She rephrases. ‚ÄúHonestly it‚Äôs fine, I just want to know your thought process?‚Äù And the best I could come out with was ‚Äúuh.. i just had an idea? I didn‚Äôt plan it‚Äù. 

I just thought it was an interesting thing. Has anyone else experienced a similar situation? Just completely unable to provide an explanation for something, particularly something you made?

I don't know many people who are as loyal to their inner circle as I am. If people talk about my friends behind their backs I'll stand up for them even if it causes conflict. I normally go to extreme lengths to avoid conflict. If a friend needs help I will go to the end of my branch to help them. Even if that means risking breaking my own branch. If I see someone doing you wrong, or think someone is doing you wrong I will let you know. If you need a friend to talk to at 3 a.m. feel free to call me even if I have work in the morning. If a bar fight breaks out I will more than happily risk getting stabbed to help you out. If you need someone to call you stupid to get you back on track. I will. If you need someone to help you bury a body. I will. If I can't help you. I will find someone who can.

These statements only scratch the surface of what I will do for people in my inner circle. If you drove up and just said, ""I can't tell you why. Put on this blindfold and get in."" I would blindfold up, get in, and not ask questions. My inner circle is a very small list. I know damn well they aren't gonna hurt me intentionally. I don't how else to explain what I am willing to do. I will do almost anything. I'm not gonna join a cult and drink the cool aide with you. I'm just gonna beat the fucking stupid out of you. I am always the person they call when they fuck up. I don't know if its because I'm reliable, or if they just feel comfortable telling me the whole truth. I am always the person they call when they need help, and nothing could make me happier. I pride myself on being able to be there for my close friends.

This just applies to my inner circle though. I will extend above average human kindness to 99% people, but I won't go out of my way in any regard. This includes my blood relatives with my mom and dad being the only exception. I would kill someone for hurting them. I honestly don't know if anyone else will ever make it into my inner circle.

And I believe they are busy as they just went back to school recently, but the effort is just no longer there anymore. Where as before even if there was things going on, the effort was there. Now it's more one-line texts, slow text responses if at all, not much initiation, and we don't see each other as much. I'm not going to mention it anymore and just accepting it for what the friendship is now but it's been difficult. If it fading out is just the evolution of the friendship, I guess.

isfp,"Let me preface this by saying that I didn't know my MBTI-type until recently, and I didn't really care all that much and I still don't, but there have been one or two small revelations. My university recently made the results from our selection tests public, and apart from some formal maths stuff, intelligence and logic tests they apparently also ran a MBTI test, and apparently I'm ISFP, which explains a couple of things or habits that my friends have been pointing out for quite some time now ‚Äì¬†for example the fact that I love to find ""beautiful things"" everywhere I go. Whether we're in the woods or walking through the city I'll often go ""Hey, doesn't that look really nice?"" ‚Äì¬†well, I guess that explains why I tend to see those things more than other people.

More to the point though, music is my life. I have been making music since I was six years old and I listen to everything, but mainly I think Progressive Rock is the best thing in the world. Now, two years ago some friends got me into trying weed and one thing I quickly noticed is that music gets EVEN BETTER. I mean, movies and other forms of art as well, but music is something different when I'm high. I have been told by other people that music is pretty relaxing when they're stoned, but I don't think anyone I know ever ""feels"" the music like I do.

isfp,"This girl and I have a mutual friend, but she doesn't know my friend is also friends with her. Anyway I found out from my friend that the girl never knew or was even suspicious that I had a crush on her until I confessed. However I thought it was at least a little suspicious because I asked for her Snapchat, Instagram, and phone number before. Plus I always approached her from behind after class to speak to her and I'm pretty sure we've made eye contact a lot of times from across the classroom unless she just always happened to look in my direction. I also asked her to grab coffee with me before and said it's my treat (this was maybe the first week or so that we started speaking). I flirted with her once through texts and even complimented her on Snapchat before. 

Throughout the entire time we knew each other, I always had to take the initiative to speak to her first but she was always engaged in the conversation and kept strong eye contact. In a couple of conversations, she put her hand on my shoulder a few times and the one time I flirted with her through text, she flirted back too and replied very quickly for someone who's a terrible texter. In one conversation, I lightly touched her upper arm for a brief second which made her eyes glue to the floor the whole time, stutter, and talk about the most random things. She chose to sit across from me in the hallway once and we kept making eye contact at the same time but again, I had to speak to her first. I notice she's more outgoing with other classmates than she is with me even though I've spoken to her more times. In almost every conversation I've had with her, she also says incorrect things such as transportation being free when it clearly isn't and she even said the wrong name of her high school. Basically she had a lot of signs (didn't list them all) of being interested, but she also had red flags such as flaking on our hangout and towards the end of the semester, ignoring some of my texts. She would also never greet me unless I greeted her first, but didn't seem to have a problem initiating with other people she didn't know well in the class. 

Anyway what I want to know is if she truly never knew or was suspicious that I was into her, why did it seem like she was giving me the cold shoulder treatment as time passed? She went from trying to jump into my conversations when we never met, smiling at me, flirting back through texts, and replying quickly to refusing to speak to me first, just laughing whenever I did try to flirt, and replying slower/ignoring my texts. She told my friend she avoids people she's suspicious are interested in her to hint that she doesn't reciprocate interest yet when asked about me, claims she never knew the entire time until I confessed. And if she was interested in me then why act this way? She also told my friend that she had a crush on a different guy and gave his name out too. I do find it a little weird since she and my friend hardly know each other so Idk why she would give out her crush's name so effortlessly but anyway do you think she really had no idea at all that I was interested? If so, what's with the whole appearing more distant/cold the more we spoke?

self-reflection is pretty important to me but no matter how aware of my faults I am, sometimes I get too excited and still commit these above tendencies. pretty frustrating.

I have been coping throughout my whole life. I looked up to Bruce Lee and Rey Mysterio because they were short like me. It made me feel better about myself. 

I pretend that I don't need women, but it's just a form of coping. ""I save a lot of money from not going on dates anyway"", ""I can use my energy for better things"", ""I won't have to pay for child support when the divorce happens"", ""I won't have to worry about being cheated on"", etc.

I just want to live like I did when I was a child. Have fun and lose track of time. Days passing by so fast, but at the same time slowly. Days are passing by fast for me now, but I wish I could enjoy them more. I feel like I'm just rotting away slowly.

isfp,"So I've noticed that I tend to be straightforward and blunt about things than many of my xxTx friends. 

For example, I was texting my INTJ friend and I told her she should come swimming with me. She told me how much she dislikes her body and she said ""I just don't think anyone really wants to actually see me in skin tight clothes/ half naked, and honestly I'm fine with that üòÇ"" 

She kept using the üòÇ emoji and became more and more passive aggressive. I tried to comfort her, and let her know that no one else cares about how she looks in a swimsuit besides herself. While I'm aware that she's very self conscious and insecure about her body, I would think an INTJ (who had previously mistyped as an INTP) would be more... straightforward? I wanted to reply in a ""tough love"" sort of way, like ""listen, I know you dislike your body and I know that me saying this isn't going to suddenly make you change your mind, but it's really painful to watch you pass up good opportunities just because of your dislike of your body. Literally no one gives a fuck about how you look, and the sooner you can realize that, the sooner you can be happier with yourself and have a more fulfilling life!""

 I know I didn't give the best example but I've noticed that so many people are just so passive aggressive and aren't ever fully honest or direct. Maybe it's just the influence of my childhood ENTJ best friend, but I'm always blunt about the truth. If they need to realize some truths, I want to be able to tell them without them getting all butthurt. After all, if they were to do the same to me (as my ENTJ friend has done to me before), I wouldn't get butthurt and would appreciate their sincere honesty. Maybe I would even realize a thing or two.

What are your thoughts on the relationship of ISFPs and other types with honesty? Do you think ISFPs have a better ability to both dish it and take it than some other types? Or am I just an asshole?

isfp,"Small preface: Primarily just a browser and I identify as ISFP but I really have to thank this sub- it's contents and users for giving me confidence/comfort in what I have/am experiencing and feeling - overall, being relatable. Anyway, here's some early morning thoughts I had on being an ISFP:  


Perhaps the biggest physical flaw to an ISFP (or maybe this extends past us) is that we are only human. When we experience something that fulfills our senses, it is a but unfortunate that we are confined to the five human senses. As a human these senses have certain physical limits - such as only being able to see/perceive fragments of the color spectrum, or in the same light hear certain sounds, or metaphorically not actually being able to feel the rush of air flowing past and under your wings as you soar through the sky. Now in writing this, I also realize that this so to speak ""flaw"" is also what makes us so amazing and unique. Though we are bound by the human senses while we heavily embrace all the various experiences of our life (music, paintings, photos, food, etc.) that fulfill our senses and in turn ""elevate"" us and our sense of feelings - those limitations are what push us to elongate those experiences and prolong that sensual high. I guess a good analogy would be like searching for that next hit or next ""high"" of whichever drug. More specifically, that is when we take that moment and put it in a different perspective, maybe away from convention even - whether it be changing the perspective, framing, or angle of a photo, shading or coloring a work of art differently, or producing a musical (or non-musical) sound that no one has ever heard - creating that next ""hit"". Honestly this does not apply to just the traditional arts, but can be projected onto any profession, hobbies or interests that a person has as long as you can imagine it. ",1550361241
isfp,"Not what your favorite songs are, your pattern of playing the songs you like, etc. fuck that, don‚Äôt care.

When I hear a song I like, in a moment, I immediately associate it with all the beauty I see in that moment. Music is truly the thing that defines all the best moments of my life. I associate songs with visuals and activities.

For example: I‚Äôm a snowboarder... if a song is playing in an awesome Travis Rice video, if I hear that song a month later, I immediately think of snowboarding.

The song I heard when I first saw the Northern Lights in Iceland was Bon Iver ‚ÄúHolocene‚Äù. So when that song comes on... I could be in the gym, driving around a city, it doesn‚Äôt matter the surroundings... emotion comes over me and I‚Äôm immediately back in that place, and I can visually picture that moment.  

I‚Äôll be hiking through a forest in France, and when a certain song that played when I was in Korea 2 years ago on top of a mountain I immediately remember about that moment.

Bottom line, I‚Äôm wondering how music relates to your senses and the moments you hear it and how it associates with you.

It means exactly what it says. Figure it out. Doing so, however, isn't always easy. Going through a rough time and crying on someones shoulder can be figuring it out. Buckling down and suffering to get it done can be figuring it out. Moving on can be figuring it out. Whatever it takes to get from your point (Point A) to the desired location (Lets say Point B) is figuring it out. Figuring it out also doesn't have anything to do with succeeding. Its all about not giving up. It isn't the thing. It is you.

No one else is going to figure it out for you. You can have help, but ultimately you have to figure it out. Whatever it takes to keep you moving is figuring it out. No matter the situation, and no matter the outcome. You have to do whatever it takes to keep moving. If you can't accept it. Change it. If you can't change it. Find a way to live without it. If you can't live without it. Find a way to live with it. Figure it out.

Stop moving for a while and think. If thats what you need to do. Then do it. You don't have to exist on a graph where your movement on said graph is constant. Your movement doesn't have to follow a pattern. You can move faster some years and slower some years. You can regress too. That is totally fine. As long as you don't give up. The moment you give up. I feel sorry for you. Giving up on yourself is the worst thing you can do. You matter. Don't you fucking dare let yourself believe you don't. Figure it out.

# There is a ""TL;DR:"" below. Don't worry guys.

&amp;#x200B;

In October I decided to leave my career during my third year. I felt very tired, not wanting to do more homework. In classes no one thought like me and I didn't see a future as an art teacher either. I also lost the habit of lifting weights. In December I felt like I had more free time, but I had 2 part-time jobs and I decided to leave my job as a waiter to be calmer with my job at the pizzeria.

&amp;#x200B;

In January I began to notice how alone I was. My best friend, M, only texted to me if I texted to him before. It seemed he wasn't interested in me. So I stopped talking to him. Each time I went down a little more. It was getting worse every time. Until this month that I was fired from my job, without explanation.

&amp;#x200B;

I lost everything because of my decisions. Now I'm besieged by my regrets and worries. I feel terrible because I'm 24 and still don't know what to do with my life because I always end up doing stupid shit like that. I feel old. Nothing in my hands. There was also the pressure to run out of food.

&amp;#x200B;

**What I'm going to do now.**

Unfuck myself. I recently sent a message to my old job as a waiter. The boss loved me very much that she told me to go to work today. Also, I think I'm going back to university or get a full time job for this year.

**Things that help me when I'm depressed.**

this could have an effect on you or not, but at least, if you propose small things and you do them, somehow your brain is taking off the depression because **you're doing something.**

&amp;#x200B;

**‚Ä¢ Order your space. Room or home.**

I noticed that when my room is tidy, my mind too. ""*Your body is your mind*"".

&amp;#x200B;

**‚Ä¢ Do it.**

this is my favorite because is the only thing I can memorize: ""The habit of getting shit done"". Just set an appointment and make it. **Choose something possible to do, and do it**. It doesn't matter how you feel about it. It doesn't matter if you're too fucking depressed to do anything. Just do the thing, every single day whether you feel like it or not.

&amp;#x200B;

The success doesn't depend on your big idea, or planification, or how much did you think in something. **Is what you fucking do what matters.**

&amp;#x200B;

**‚Ä¢ Take a shower everyday.**

I didn't do it. But the feeling of post-shower and that freshness is really helpful to make you think better and to mantain a **minimal routine** that makes each day to be separated from the other. I also will take more care of my little beard.

&amp;#x200B;

**‚Ä¢ If you can, wake up at the same time everyday.**

I broke my circadian rhythm 2 months ago. There is nothing more depressing than waking up and watch the sunset. Also, morning is motivating.

&amp;#x200B;

**‚Ä¢ Propose to yourself, only 2 or 3 things, no more.**

It depends on you, but I can't handle so many things in my mind, which is a bad thing because I find many many things interesting. But now I'm playing with just 3 available slots: **1) A job:** This is obligatory for me. **2) A career:** maybe I will come back to university or use this space of time to another skill **3) A skill that you like to learn**: I'm learning a new language. **4) drawing:** A little one is to improve my drawing skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**‚Ä¢ Before taking a decision, talk to your friends.**

I took a lot of stupid decisions. You need other points of view.

&amp;#x200B;

**‚Ä¢ DON'T OVERLOAD YOURSELF.**

I did it and I got fucked up. Don't choose so many activities because you will not be abble to respond well.

# TL;DR:

Poor aux Se, silly Ni and absent Te made me commit a lot of mistakes.

&amp;#x200B;

**Poor Se**: take care of your environment. order your room. Don't overload yourself. Be direct and simple. don't complicate yourself.

**Silly Ni:** I took a lot of bad decisions from incongruous presumptions of the future. Don't assume things that you do not know if they are real. Talk to your friends before making a decision. Ask your friends to help you see the future that you want to have.

**Special mention, Fi:** just don't let your emotions fuck everything and dominate your life. Think what your true feelings are, and put them above your feelings of the moment.

**Te:** Learn the habit of getting shit done. See above in ""***‚Ä¢ Do it"".*** Choose something and do it. No matter how you feel. Be direct and simple.",1550254190

isfp,"I only applied to one college this year with the thought process of ""Ok, if I get in, cool, I'll consider going in the fall. If not, I'll work a semester or two and save more, and then go to college."" (Because we live overseas, so I need to save since I'll be so far from my family and they won't be supporting me financially). Well anyways, after a misunderstanding, I thought I had to physically mail in my transcripts since they said they hadn't received them yet about 3 weeks ago. I didn't mail them until a week ago because I kept forgetting. 

So I logged on today to see if my transcripts went through (and apparently they were received Feb 01 electronically lol). I saw a button that said ""Confirm Intent to Enroll"", and, because I'm dumb and thought it was just one of those ""hey, if we're your first choice college, we'll give you extra consideration"" kind of things,  so I clicked it, and next thing I know, the screen said ""Congratulations! Your admission has been confirmed! You can now register for classes"".

So yeah. I guess I'm going to college for sure this fall :). I'm definitely excited, although a little frantic right now since I don't think it *actually* occurred to me that I might be making this big move in a few months. (Also, disclaimer, I'm not being ^(completely) irresponsible, I have a state scholarship that covers 100% of my tuition through my Bachelors, as well as some other school-related-expenses, and dorm/living expenses will be manageable with a job on the side. Plus I've been working and saving as much as possible, I was just hoping to have *a little* more money before moving out:). 

Just thought I'd share! I'm honestly amazed that it didn't occur to me that I would accidentally do something like this, as it is COMPLETELY in line with my usual antics lol. It's been kind of a crazy couple of hours, because at first I thought it was a bug in the system. I'm a little stressed right now just trying to figure everything out, although I'm definitely laughing at myself as well;).

isfp,"I remember when I was in love with Anime. Now I can barely watch a single episode without getting bored. I started to track the episodes I watch 5 years ago and add them onto my Anime list.

I don't know if tracking my Anime has caused me to love Anime less or if I am just genuinely bored of it. I have been watching it ever since middle school...

My goal is to have watched 10,000 episodes. Why this is my goal? I don't know. But I want to complete this goal. 

Maybe I should try not to rush this, and enjoy every episode to the fullest. And I should also probably take a little break from Anime and hopefully my interest in it will be renewed.

He‚Äôs not artistic in the typical sense, but he does enjoy music and he plays guitar. He definitely focuses on what‚Äôs happening now in the present, rather than worrying or dreaming about the future. He‚Äôs always the first to lend help and he‚Äôs really loyal to the people he cares about.

Most of the time it‚Äôs fine and provides some balance and insight (for me more than him I think) but when something comes up that we see differently, it turns into me ‚Äútelling him what to do‚Äù if my opinion on the topic differs from his. 

I try to frame things from experience/intuition and try to use I and we statements vs you statements. In pure INTJ fashion I will also try and make suggestions or suggest alternative options when he isn‚Äôt happy about something in his life or we‚Äôre trying to find a balance. That usually gets interpreted as me telling him what to do even though he may agree that what I‚Äôm saying holds merit. 

Any suggestions on this? I‚Äôm open to working on my communication style, but when I try to flex it still seems like it doesn‚Äôt translate. I‚Äôm trying to figure out how much is me and how much is his stubbornness. ",1550157231
isfp,"I‚Äôve recently gotten into MBTI Theory, and most of the online tests had me pegged as an INFP or INFJ.  But after being typed by others online as an ISFP, and understanding more about the Sensory/Intuition dichotomy, I‚Äôm fairly certain I am indeed an ISFP.

My question is, what are the nature of your daydreams, and how focused are they?  

I daydream all the time when I am in boring mundane environments, but they are always focused on things rooted in reality (not abstract ideas).

For Example:  

I love to travel overseas... it is what motivates me more than anything.  At any given time I will be mentally (and literally) planning my next 3 trips. When I am in the office at work, I will spend hours on end, mentally away from my current surroundings, thinking about what hikes I want to do in Iceland, or what Lisbon neighborhood I want to stay in.  Between sets at the gym, I‚Äôm mentally cataloging things I want to do on my next adventure, or while driving at a stop light I‚Äôm picking up my phone to look up the best baguette in Paris because it‚Äôs all I‚Äôve been thinking about for the last 5 minutes.  I go days/weeks entirely focused on a small set of ideas/themes... and it completely consumes me.

On the flip side, put me in an environment that I‚Äôm passionate about, and my mind goes blank except for that which is around me, and I‚Äôm locked into every detail of my surroundings... taking it all in.

For Example:  

I‚Äôve played competitive soccer my whole life. Once I step on the field, everything is instinctual... my mind and senses are locked into every key detail of my surroundings, and my entire focus is on everything going on in my environment.  I also snowboard... when I‚Äôm on the mountain, everything is the feeling of floating through the snow, the beauty of nature, the peaceful quiet of the mountains... all my senses are focused on my environment.  Same thing when I hike in nature, or am walking around a foreign city taking in every detail of the art &amp; architecture, the conversation of the locals, smells of the food.

I live in the present when it interests me, and when I‚Äôm somewhere boring, all I‚Äôm thinking about is transporting myself to a better present.  I have very little long term goals other than living life to the fullest... my work (which bores me, but I am good at), is merely a necessary paycheck to fund my passions, and my mind transports me from those mundane environments on a daily basis.

Also, I should note that most of this mental planning I do constantly goes out the window once I get to the moment I‚Äôve been thinking about for hours on end.  Once I am there, in the here and now, I do what feels right and any itinerary I put together goes out the window.  I become overcome with the beauty of the moment and my surroundings, and it takes over all else.

I‚Äôm curious... is this a common theme among ISFPs, or might I be mistyping myself?

Hi Im a male college student who's been pursuing a female a my school. Please read all of it and tell me anything you think!
So, there's this girl I've gone on 1 date with, and have talked to for 2 and a half weeks. She was in one of my classes last semester, but we matched on tinder recently, and that's how we linked. For the first week after I match with her, we have great conversations over text. Things go great. She not only responds but also makes a deliberate effort to carry on the conversation unlike many women I match with. After the week I start snapchatting her and get her Instagram as well as her ""finsta."" Things seem to be going too well because I had considered her ""out of my league,"" but my friends tell me otherwise. So I eventually ask her out and she agree to the date, place, AND location without hesitation. (Wow?)
---Red Flag 1 (the night before the date)
I considered this girl really special because even though she was really attractive, she didn't seem like a party animal or a ""hoe."" The night before the day of the date, she suddenly edits her profile on tinder, which she hadn't done in the timeframe since we matched. She switches up some pictures and adds ""down to party so hmu! (heart emoji)"" Then she proceeds to post a video on her finsta which is basically a recording of her semi-embarrassingly showing off a hickey on her neck. Caption is ""Wild throwbacks from the past."" Yes girls can have their fun too, but who posts that kind of stuff on their Instagram, and what is the point of doing that? It just bothered me. 
---The day of the date
The day of the date comes, and we are supposed to have lunch. She arrives 15 minutes late, but that's okay as she apologized. She is gorgeous and VERY into me, to the point that I'm thinking, ""Am I that attractive?"" Constant eye-contact and smiles, everything goes great during the date. We both agree that we want to see each other again. But during the date, I did run into some things that bothered me. 
---Red flag (during the date) 
First of all, her age is fake, and she never mentioned it. It says she is 19, but she's 18. That means that she's had a tinder account for at least a year, while in how school. So curiously, I ask some questions about her past experiences. She says she's had her ""fair share"" of messing around on the app, which I interpret as hooking up people.  When asked about relationships, she says she's had three serious relationships. To me this just doesn't add up. I've been thinking she was this nice innocent good girl, but now she's suddenly a 18 year-old who's had 3 serious relationships, who's hooked up with enough guys and now wants something serious. But she's only 18? If my interpretations are true, I would never date this girl. 
---Red Flags ( after date)
So as soon as I get home, I snapchat her saying how I enjoyed her company would love to take her out again. She responds after 8 hours, around 1 oclock, because apparently she had been partying all night. However, her snapscore has gone up at least 100. Then she posts another photo on Instagram, with her and another guy with his arm around her showing them having fun. This post is captioned, "" Tonight was wild (heart emoji)"". The man in the photo comments, ""(heart emoji)"" At this point I realize that she may not be the person I pictured, and is probably seeing other guys too. 
---continued
So We've been going back and forth on snapchat for a bit now. Her response times and steadily getting slower but at times she responds within an hour. The thing that bothers me is that she is on snapchat all the time, and I can see when she last opened the app because she is visible on snapmaps. Her score goes up a fuck ton everyday, but she seems to take her sweet time not reading my snap and responding after a millenia. Another extremely weird thing I noticed is that when I check where she is through snapmaps around 10-11pm or even later, she is at different places each time. I'm talking about 3 different towns and cities. Sometimes she's in the middle of fucking nowhere. My pessimistic and insecure mind just pictures her fucking a  random dude in a car or an apartment everynight.
---Conclusion.
I know I overthink and seem insecure, but this dating game just drains me too hard. Whatever comes up to your mind after reading this, please comment. I need whatever I can get. Advice, support, guidance? Anything. Help. I really want to learn from this experience.

‚Ä¢ I like to express myself with drawings but I hate to spend a long time doing one.

‚Ä¢ I‚Äôm not super aware of changing details or the environment. Actually I never noticed many details.

‚Ä¢  It is as if things always lack a little piece of something to be completely meaningful. No activity that I know fills me completely. No goal excites me enough because I always think something like ‚Äúand then what?‚Äù.

‚Ä¢  I always had trouble figuring out what to do to earn money. I‚Äôm 24 and I  studied 3 years of visual arts to left the university. Now I‚Äôm going to study to be a language teacher and a translator.

‚Ä¢ I can be very judgey sometimes.

‚Ä¢ I have stages of very good self-discipline, healthy diet, without missing excercise days, etc.

‚Ä¢ I can find it really hard to find something to say in a conversation, and also I have trouble speaking fluently.

‚Ä¢  I am very clear about my opinion about trendy violent ideologies, and I can get quite angry that most people decide to follow the flock, or a trend, or the politically correct (that is actually harmful) instead of thinking for themselves and find a posture that is really good for society.

‚Ä¢ I sometimes can have quit rages with videogames.

‚Ä¢  When I‚Äôm happy I tend to be very childlike when socializing or playing, and when I‚Äôm pissed off I can be very adult and a bit asshole. That makes me wonder about what my real identity. And I can never find the answer.

I hate having to pick side unnecessarily, or having to choose which parents I love more and stuff. I passionately hate anyone that make me choose between such important people/needs. So I‚Äôll never put anyone in that situation even if they are my worst enemy. 

But life don‚Äôt always work as I want, and we have to make those difficult choices. 

Was I too entitled or too selfish to ask my significant people to suffer with me a little(before we get back to a comfortable level) to get away from those who abused and bullied us, but in order to do that, my significant people would have to abandoned their significant people (because some of my bullies are my significant people‚Äôs significant people or they‚Äôre closely related). 

My significant people did abandon their significant people for me eventually, and it was a bit late for my liking, but nothing I can‚Äôt handle. And I‚Äôm so grateful for it. 

Now, we‚Äôre still in the suffering period, and I say I can see the comfortable level again in the near future.

As kind as they are, my significant people practice ‚Äúforgive and forget‚Äù too literally, and they‚Äôre putting this person‚Äô comfort above some of our own basic needs. I‚Äôm not 100% on board with this, but I‚Äôll help them out and do my part just to make their load easier as possible. 

Now, do I have the right to upset that my significant people decided to not compromise on something that might or might not take away the neutral person‚Äôs comfort Or delaying our process to get to the comfortable level by maybe 2-5 years? 

I would work harder and do whatever I can to not put my significant people in a situation that I hate so much, but I‚Äôm struggling with my own issues and I don‚Äôt have extra to energy for this.

Not to be super ISFP, but all the extreme speculation within MBTI forums seems silly / pointless to me. I used to be a lot more interested in mbti, but now it just seems like a lot of us are obsessing over something that we feel like Myer-Briggs types gives us, when our types just don‚Äôt do anybody justice. 

I think the most harmful part about mbti that I‚Äôve been seeing, is how people overgeneralize others based on their type, even though there are literally SO many other factors in play to why they‚Äôre that way (to the point where it‚Äôs not even funny). I also think if you define yourself strictly to the inconsistent descriptions circulating the net about your type, you‚Äôre gonna brainwash yourself into thinking you‚Äôre supposed to fit into that mold, as if you‚Äôre getting assigned an identity rather than going out and finding it yourself.

Sure, I‚Äôm glad people have found fun in it, or have found people to relate with, or have found it useful for their first step in self-awareness, but it‚Äôs (sorry,) just a little silly how much time we spend trying to define ourselves (and others) according to these types. 

Even the enneagrams. For those who follow it, I got 5w4 and read multiple times that it‚Äôs ‚Äúalmost impossible‚Äù for an ISFP to be a 5w4, unless they‚Äôre an IS**T**P. But who made these rules? And who even cares at this point?

At one point I was, by habit, typing everyone in my head after being subbed to r/mbti and this sub. Then I very quickly started feeling really silly about it. Now, I‚Äôve taken it upon myself to notice the key, defining traits about others and stop there. I also make sure to not hold any these traits against them (they‚Äôre subject to changing and are allowed to change themselves as they grow). 

I still like this sub and will visit from time to time.

INTJ:


+I can get along with them rather easily, behavior-wise I'd say I'm way more INTJ than ISFP. Conversations with them are fun and interesting, I also tend to share interests and sense of humor with them.

-Can be a bit too uptight sometimes, immature ones are rather annoying (feelings are for the weak (basically denying their Fi), /r/iamverysmart behavior, etc) and their constant need to be working on something can be exhausting sometimes.

INFJ:

+They have this whole cool ""wise old person"" vibe going on, I enjoy that. Often very wise people. They're not really judgemental. 

-The INFJ doorslam. Are either really nice or really nasty. Can seem rather cold when they ""turn off"" their Fe and rely on their Ti.

INTP:

+Laid-back. Don't really judge you unless you do stupid shit. Will *listen* to most things you have to say. 

-Rather apathetic and hard to communicate with.

INFP:

+Very friendly and interesting people. Basically the more warm and dreamy INTJs. Very open minded.

-A little prone to fall into the ""woe is me"" mode and fall into a spiral of self-pity. Can be a bit pretentious (*too* open minded) from a PoLR Ne's perspective. Well, maybe I worded that a bit harsh..

ISTJ:

+Rather laid-back. They're rather relaxing to be around with.

-They tend to hold grudges REALLY badly so I tend to be rather careful around them. A bit too grumpy sometimes.

ISFJ:

+Generally very friendly. Keep their promises and don't forget things like so many other people do. Very helpful.

-Tend to be a bit too selfless sometimes for my tastes, infodump a TON during conversations, can do the ""either jesus or satan"" thing the INFJ does. A bit boring.

ISTP:

+Good sense of humor, laid-back, easy to talk to, pretty friendly (seriously their friendly side is underappreciated).

-A bit hard to have ""deep"" conversations with. Sometimes seem a little oblivious. 

ISFP:

Not sure what to say here because in my eyes it'd be basically reviewing myself. If I have to two things though, ISFP girls are the best and I find some ISFP's attempt at trying to be all artsy and hipster rather cringy.

ENTJ:

+Seem rather cool. Get shit done.

-A bit too focused on getting shit done, it seems like there isn't much more to them than that. Rather intimidating. 

ENFJ:

+Very friendly and understanding. 

-Too selfless and focused on other people for my tastes, can get really annoying (basically most /r/2meirl4meirl posts). 

ENTP: 

+Sometimes funny. Will *listen* to most things you have to say.

-Tend to be very snarky, sarcastic and intimidating, often attack Fi views in the most aggressive way possible. Nobody can tear someone down harder than an ENTP. 

ENFP:

+Very optimistic, friendly, energetic and fun. 

-Can be a bit tiring to be around after a while. 

ESTJ:

+Goofy sense of humor. 

-A bit too focused on getting shit done, it seems like there isn't much more to them than that. Rather intimidating. 

ESFJ:

+Generally friendly. 

-Very unaccepting of things they deem weird, generally a bit fake, gossip too much and don't really respect alone time. 

ESTP:

+Somewhat cool. Their ability to adapt to any situation is pretty impressive. 

-Can be very intimidating if angry at you or unhealthy. Unhealthy ones are probably the worst people to encounter irl. The douchebro bully stereotype is 100% true for those.

ESFP:

+ESFP girls are **hot**. Very fun and easy going. Know their friends very well from experiences and go much deeper than people give them credit for. They bring out the best in me.

-Sometimes a bit too energetic, I'm rather lazy so I don't really want to do that much stuff. A bit too focused on the real world, don't really enjoy things like games and anime most of the time. Unhealthy ones can seem a bit like unhealthy ESTPs.

I am very passionate about things that are important to me, but I am also very emotional and sensitive..friends say I wear my heart on my sleeve but acquaintances say I am intimidating. I guess i'm posting here because i'm wondering if this classification can possibly help me explain my relationship with each of my parents (divorced).

For my mom when I did the test got ESFP and for my dad I got ESTP. I am very, very close with my mom but with my dad we clash so much to the point where I currently refuse to speak to him because I just can't tolerate his behavior towards people. I don't really know how to explain him...like he is super charming/likable to people who don't know him well and likes to be liked by people because he tells you what you want to hear....he is also very intelligent and he isn't judgemental either which I guess in a way I admire that about him, but he is also ruthless/selfish/manipulative and he does whatever he wants without caring how it affects others which fundamentally clashes with my moral compass and pisses me off to no extent. Like he wouldn't think twice about ruining someone's life to do something that may only slightly benefit him but at the same time, he likes to be popular and is fun to be around when he isn't being an asshole. Its funny because I am probably one of the only people who can outsmart him and not get manipulated easily by him and as a result, I am one of the only people who he fears/respects. 

My mom is very stubborn and blunt which makes her a lot less likable than my dad to people who don't know her well and it can be irritating, but she will tell it how it is and is very altruistic and kind and its her honesty which makes her probably my favorite person on earth. It honestly makes me sad how people consider her to be way less likable than my dad just because she doesn't tell you what you want to hear when she is one of the most genuine people to have as a friend and will bend over backwards to help you become a better person.

isfp,"Can be your experience with them, opinion on the users, etc.

----

**Fe**: Overall, when used in a positive way I like it and I always do my best to go along with it and avoid conflicts, but I tend to find it a really annoying function sometimes, as well (mostly lower Fe, though), like when someone blames themselves for everything, hates themselves and the things they like, and feel everyone else is superior to them. I just can't understand that mindset, that you think the things you believe in are worthless and your only sense of self-worth is how good you are to others. Or when group values are treated like the holy texts and personal values are shunned and treated like sins. Just no, please. Very hit or miss, basically. But overall I don't clash with it often.

 **Si**: I actually know very little about this function, probably the function I know least about. Overall I just go ""meh"" when I see it pop up. The only thing I dislike for sure about Si is the fact that they can be very conservative.

**Ne**: Together with Ti, probably my least favorite functions. I find that the users often have this indirect ""holier than thou"" vibe, they always feel the need to be all quirky and deep and tend to be rather patronizing towards people with bad Ne, dismissing them as shallow, because oh no, you don't consider the 10 billion other methods you can put mustard on your toast. It's a bit in the same ballpark as Fe when used negatively, imo, it justs seems rather fake and tryhard to me most of the time. I do like a few things about Ne users, though, first off I enjoy the fact that they can deal with whatever you want to talk to them about (Si and Se users tend to ignore me when I ramble on about games or Dragon Ball, for example), they're also very open to people that don't find the mold (I'm autistic and I think pretty much everyone who judged or bullied me for that was ESTP, and while I don't get along with ENTPs at all, they at least didn't attack me for *that* aspect).

**Ti**: The ""I understand how it works, but I can't fathom actually being like that"" function. In a way, it's the most simple function in the sense that it's easy to understand how it works, but it's the hardest function to understand why someone would actually want to use it. Obviously, as Fi doms we are very driven and place a ton of importance on our opinions, feelings and impressions, whereas Ti is painfully clinical and apathetic. It's kinda like the system inside a game which decides whether you're game over or not, the game doesn't care at all, it just decides based on what's logical or not. Overall I'm okay with it, but I do sometimes find that people who use Ti can get a bit scary, especially when INTPs or IxFJs use it, it's kinda like their face displays how dead inside they are or something. Maybe I'm looking into it too much. What I find weirdest is how they can be so apathetic and not let their emotions influence them even in the slightest. Like I understand that you don't want to act on them, but like.. how can you not even be aware of them? Mystifies me.",1548424088

isfp,"Hello guys, 

It is my first post and writing mistakes may be made since English is not my native language ( sorry about that) 

I'm 24 years old , and I've discovered my type one year ago and since then I've been confused. I have a personal history regarding changing degree that I'm not proud of , I've been changing my decision about careers about 4 times already. I went from agriculture, sociology , psychology , marketing , business and now i'm studying management in college. I also work part time at a company who produces and sells aquariums and I have a good professional relationship with my boss. He says he wants me to be the future manager there when I will finish my business degree.

I am not sure if that is what I want to do , I've completed  rigurous aptitude tests, and the results where that I have very good visual spatial skills and very good analitycal thinking, and that I might be good at engineering. In school I've always liked science, and I have been passionate about aquariums. Now I don't have any passion, I am super confused , I feel stuck , I have no motivation to continue , because I feel that maybe I am missing something better. Also , I've read that ISFP's have trouble finishing their studies , and I am worried that with my indecision I might remain without any type of higher education and then I will regret it. Lately I had obsesive thoughts about this problem.

Any advice ? How do you guys made a decision about your career path ?

isfp,"Just wanted to explain how I think being as ISFP effects me and my personality. Maybe some can relate.

I come across shy and quiet to people, but really I just don't like opening up to people I'm not close to. I find it hard to think of what to say, and I sometimes feel too exhausted to even try having a conversation and just accept being quiet. However, if I have the energy and am in a 1 on 1 conversation, I can act very charismatic and extroverted, primarily with cute girls though, not gonna lie.

I'm often observant and always taking in my surroundings. My friends will sometimes wonder why I turn around and look around the room like I'm paranoid sometimes. I just like knowing what's around me, and I get anxious if I don't, like in the dark, or swimming in deep water. Along the lines of being observant, I feel like I'm good at reading people and understanding they're motives.

When researching ISFPs, I found that we are often very in tune with our five senses. Which I've always had a problem with sensory overload since I was little. Textures, sounds, and smells have always been very loud and can overwhelm me sometimes. Not sure if these are connected.

People are often scared by change, I'm the opposite. I can't stand things being monotonous, especially my job. I feel like I need to be doing something different, or an new adventure everyday. I don't like living in the same place for very long, I'd love to just live in a van and sleep in a different town everynight.

I don't plan things out very well. I hate things being scheduled and having to plan what I'm going to do. This makes me feel trapped and colostrophobic. I often do things in the moment, with very little planning.

Don't really know what I was getting at with all this. I've just been trying to be self aware for the past few months and have learned a lot about myself and why I do things.",1547968769

I remember feeling this after being really heartbroken and I had to take medication to feel like myself again. Recently I asked him how he was doing and he said that he was alright but adjusting to his new place, which I feel like is code for not doing so well.

List of my traits: 

Pretty sure I am Fi, Te, Se, Ni, but I‚Äôm not sure the order..and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm INTJ or ISFP

1. I find it easy to make decisions and stick to them
2. Tend to have unwavering opinions, I will debate something until I agree 100% with the logic of the other side
3. Tend to take the position of leader in a group of people
4. Always daydreaming and zoned out 
5. Tend to be insensitive because I‚Äôm super objective
6. Sarcastic comments all the time
7. When I‚Äôm stressed I get hyper focused on my work and start organizing everything
8. When I‚Äôm super stressed I start spiraling and freaking out over how I am failing 
9. If I am sad and don‚Äôt want to be I can reason to myself why I shouldn‚Äôt be and kinda turn it off, the majority of the time
10. Really love art, reading, aesthetics, things like that 
11. Get introspective all the time

13. In an argument, I‚Äôm good at responding right away without having to think things through

isfp,"So I've recently figured out I'm an ISFP and after reading many descriptions, I'm amazed that they describe me to a tee. Just want to vent to people who may understand me if that's fine.. 
My emotions and thoughts are extremely special to myself and are what I feel really defines me. I can't describe how much my emotions make me who I am.  Because of this I'm often quiet, not because I'm shy like it comes across, but because I only share what I really feel and think with those who I really, really trust and are close to. A while ago, without going into detail, a friend had been able to slowly get closer to me as a person and this person began to become very special to me. I began opening up to this person, which again is very hard for me to do, since my feelings and thoughts are something special to me and I like them to stay with just me. After some time, this person and I became very close, and I was probably the happiest I had ever been. Untill they decided to take what I has opened up and shared with them, and destroy it. They could have been honest with me, but they even lied to me which only made me feel betrayed more. Now I feel like I just won't ever share my thoughts and feelings with anyone, like I never now who I can trust with something so important to myself. So now I've began to almost close myself off entirely from people and friends, not even letting them see a little bit of what's inside me, knowing people will just tear it apart again.

After reading more from ISFP's they often are deeply affected by criticism, and I really agree. I feel like another reason I come across closed off to people is I feel like I'll be judged or critisized for what I feel and think. So I just keep my feelings to myself, and my art to myself who will really appreciate and understand.

Don't know if anyone understands me, or even read this. It just felt good to let something out to people who might understand.

We have a lot of the same values and I‚Äôm insanely attracted to the Se, which is elusive to me. You can talk theoretically with me, but we also have a lot of fun adventures. But the thing that breaks my heart is how independent you are. At the end of the day, you and your own happiness comes first. I don‚Äôt fault you for it at all, but maybe because we don‚Äôt always want the same things, I find it sad that you would not often make sacrifices for someone else. For example, the ISFP guy I dated, I just had the impression that what he wanted the most was freedom and the ability to do anything whenever he wanted. One day we‚Äôd be so in love, the next he‚Äôd want to go to France and not even think of how I would feel. As my brother gets older, I start to see that as well. We used to do everything together and I love him so much. But he recently told me that he wants to explore the world to see which place felt the most like him and to live there. I want to do that as well, but family is also really important to me, so I‚Äôd make sacrifices in order to be closer to family. But I know my brother wouldn‚Äôt care. He fundamentally sees himself as alone in the world anyway so his happiness is most important to him. 
I consider myself a pretty independent person, but this always makes me sad. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm generalizing, especially because I have ISFP friends who are married and happy and probably have to make some compromises.

However, criticism does always get my attention. Whether it's aimed at me or something I like, criticism always gets my attention. Especially when it's very mean-spirited and aimed at something I like, I really can't stand that. It's kinda annoying, I wish I could care less.",1547652222

I recently started looking into mbti and found it interesting so I did a few tests. At first I thought I was INFP, and some of it really fits, but some does not. I've been doing cognitive functions tests to see, and they mostly give me ISFP instead. When I read the descriptions and differences, I feel like I could be both.

I also had a test say I was an ENFJ, but that just sounds strange to me. I am, however, much more outgoing than what people expect from an introvert when I am comfortable and well.

isfp,"My ex was an isfp. We broke up bc of our different values, beliefs, and goals. I initiated the break up and he said he understood where I was coming from. It was an amicable break up and we still had a lot of feelings for each other. We kept in touch. At first I said it would be too hard for me to be friends. But, I like cheering him on in his endeavors and I wanted him to feel that there was a person who would always care for him. I wanted him to know that I would still be there for him if he needed me. 

I went on vacation for a few months and we still talked but it was maybe once or twice a week. I initiated a lot of the conversations and calls. 

One day I texted him to ask him how things were going with school &amp; his life. He didn't answer until a day later even though he was active on social media. He did text me two days after to tell me something that happened to him. We talked a bit but  the conversation just ended with him saying one word. 

The next day I texted to see how he was feeling as he was sick. The conversation went well again in the beginning. But, then he answered with one word and lots of spelling mistakes, which he never did before. The conversation just ended bc he didn't respond to a comment I made. 

I know in the past he didn't answer sometimes bc that is what isfps do. But, it felt like he didn't want to really talk. He used to ask about my day but the last series of conversations was about him and they were kept short by him. 

So I decided to give him space. He didn't reach out again. I came home from my trip and decided not to reach out bc I was over thinking things (typical of an enfp). He knew that I was coming home that month. 

Then, two weeks after, he deleted me from social media. At this point we didn't talk for about a month. 

Is been 2 months of NC. Idk why but it bothers me that we just fade from each other. We both commiserate well when dating and I just thought that if he didn't want to talk to me, he would have respected what we had enough to tell me instead of fading out. 

Isfps, do you guys tend to cut your exes off without saying a word? Is it bc I didn't text him to tell him I was home? Can you guys be friends with your exes?

I am usually fairly good at reading people, but I must admit that he is somewhat of an enigma in that department.

We have had a few very enjoyable conversations, but there are also situations where he prefers more to be around my sister or talking with other people. I often make accidental eye contact with people and have done it a few times with him. He usually just smiles and we end up laughing. He recently gave me his phone number just to be friendly, which I texted only once. Our conversation was short and a product of my sister asking me to text him. I haven't contacted him since, which was about three days ago.

isfp,"An ISFP likes me. We talk mostly online... I would say we‚Äôre 6 months into, maybe more. We avoid small talk. :) I love that. Whenever I want to talk, I‚Äôll go into a rant or try to ask him questions. 

His replies are awesome and minimal, succinct. I find him incredibly enticing. Waiting for his replies, no matter the content of them, brings me so much joy. 

(It‚Äôs like his replies are hard candy tootsie roll lollipops with his core sore self being the gooey chocolate in the middle).

Recently, things have changed for me‚Äî mostly in the feels department. I am going to see him this weekend for the first time in months. We‚Äôre going to the same social music event.

 I‚Äôve been thinking about him all week. I cannot wait to see him again. 

However ... he has a girlfriend. And she‚Äôs awesome as far as style/social media goes. He was sexually interested in me in the beginning of our conversations, and I was too, however things slowed down a bit when he became more serious with her. Since then we‚Äôve been friends, continuing to talk and share memes and trade music bands and stuff. 

From what he‚Äôs told me, there might not be a lot of trust in that relationship instilled anymore. She cheated when they became more serious, he was hurt. 

My friend, INFJ/INFP, she knows most of the situation. She‚Äôs even read through our texts. She says that he likes me. Like genuinely likes me, as she‚Äôs recognized the vibe and flows of our communication style. Even goes as far as to say that his current relationship might just be an instagram/social climbing facade. She‚Äôs analyzed his girlfriend‚Äôs cheating as a big chip in their relationship/connection of trust.

Since he is introverted, and of my friend‚Äôs insight, since he is in a sense, ‚Äúletting me in‚Äù, 
does this give hope towards a possible romantic entanglement? 

I‚Äôm unsure and too excited to wait. Just telling him I like him has not won him over in the past, however he‚Äôs always been there for me whenever I‚Äôve expressed distress or negative feelings. 

Does he like me? What should I do?

Lately I've been toying with the idea of a fresh start. I've been seriously contemplating moving to the other side of the country, somewhere I would know no one. 

I think deep down I'm running away from my emotional attachment to my family. I've lived alone for about 3 years now. Most of my family is relatively close to me (less than 5 hours driving).

But I feel like I'm intentionally isolating myself from them. I always feel like I've never lived up to expectations, I've made poor choices that have hindered me from further developing a relationship with my sisters. I feel like a massive failure to my parents most of the time, and there's this constant gnawing at the back of my mind telling me not to waste any time and to spend time with them while I can. I recently lost my grandfather and I didn't go to his funeral (I'm just a shithead really). 

That's killing me too, i visited him in hospice and he was so frail, not the stern, broad shouldered man I grew up to respect and admire. 

I think I didn't want to tarnish my memory of him and when I saw him so I'll I just couldn't deal with it.

Sometimes I just say something (unintentionally) that rubs them the wrong way and they get mad at me (for example, my current boss is an ESTP and I had a conflict with him a few times, every time because apparently I hinted at him being a liar, like wtf).

isfp,"So I'm a bisexual boy and have been decent friends with this straight-esque ISFP for about two years now. We're in the same grade in high school. Thing is, he's so charismatic on the surface to the point where you wouldn't even begin to think he was an introvert at heart. He was eccentric, witty, smart, stable and even soft-hearted at some points. Everybody in our class loved him as the class clown; like as if he was some entertaining gadget to fiddle with.¬†

Our friendship sparked out of his attraction for my articulation in English and our shared interest in music. Apparently I came across off as different from most high-schoolers at time, so he was stimulated whenever I was in his presence. At first, it was all a gimmick for the both of us; poking fun at how we were obsessed with each other like some bro-magnet of sort. Before I knew it, it started to gradually get more serious. Our online convos would take place during the latest/dead hours at night about the most confidential and intimate topics; things such our dreams, fears, passion, family and even who we liked. One time he asked me to analyze his favorite song, in regards to how it resonated with his feelings. The lyrics suggested that he was heartstruck with someone and it felt so bittersweet knowing that he was probably directing it towards a girl but confided in me to share the sensitive side of himself. Whenever our intimate moments took place he'd always go along the lines of, ""Btw this chat is only between us"" or ""This will always be a safe place for the both of us"". Wasn't until then that my heart was stimulated at the fact that I had a guy friend that I could be personal with, which was genuinely new to me at the time. I felt so secure and safe with him. For each time that I was facing an adversity, he'd be there to message and comfort me through virtual hugs and reminding me why I was amazing to him. I had officially become a puppy attached to my new owner.¬†

Suddenly there had been a downward shift in our bond. He'd leave my messages on read and barely acknowledge my presence in person. Our convos began to feel ingenuine and rushed. Classwork was all that we were limited to talking about. I got the vibe that I was irking him with every text that I spammed, hoping to get a mere response out of him. I'd be so downbeat at the sight of watching him interacting with everybody and winning their heart while his indifference broke mine. Perhaps he lost the spark with me and wanted to seek seemingly more interesting friendships. I was so confused, for it felt like I had lost a special companionship within the blink of an eye. I became a ghost to him. A sad, yet non-existent ghost.¬†

However that wasn't the end of my magical friendship gone incomplete. My crush would occasionally still message and talk to me, but supposedly only on his terms. Whenever I laid in bed with my lifeless heart thinking about him, he'd send an article or video of his favorite movie/song for us to have a short-lived discussion about it, only for him to leave me on read and return back to the abyss. At this point, I felt like I was gasping for air. As if I was receiving CPR after drowning in water, just for me to be thrown back in again. Rinse. Repeat.¬†

As much as there was strangeness in the new way he communicated with me, he showcased it in his actions as well. I'd passed by him and he'd walk in the opposite direction or seem overly busy or preoccupied when I tried to talking to him. Then he'd corner me for what felt like slightly scripted conversation whenever it was just the two of us alone. There'd be times during class where he'd make a goofball out of himself and I'd be only person he'd look at for a reaction, as he'd gaze into my eyes with his mischievous, seductive smile. He would also make light jokes at my expense, which would soon be followed by him apologizing to me in private. If he caught someone giving me a hard time or opposing my ideas, he'd show up out of nowhere to my rescue like a knight in shining armor. Overall, it was like as if he was making up for the times he wasn't there for me, yet he'd go back to simultaneously ignoring me when there were groups of people around us. My mind began to dismiss it as him just looking out for me like a little brother but my heart truly wanted him to desire more than a friendship. I had officially become a hopeless romantic; waiting for my prince charming to show some limerence.¬†

Wasn't until after our school musical (that I acted in and he played guitar in the pit orchestra for), he casually asked me, ""who did you like this whole school year?"". It around the time I had given out a few hints to my friends on whom I liked so I played it off by saying I knew the person for a few years and really wanted to confess to them. He wanted to know for the sake of 'hearing entertainment to use up his energy' and that 'his heart was aching for me' out of sympathy. Part of me still despises myself to this day for not telling him the truth. Even if it meant scaring him off.¬†

So I wonder...could he like me back? Or is he still wanting to stay intimate friends with me? Also could there be a chance that he's a closeted bisexual? He has seemed so unsure of himself for the past few months. Like as if his future comprises of a blank canvas. I know that guys like his personality type are usually susceptible to staying on the down low about these kinds of stuff. I've seen him act flamboyant and sarcastically flirt with other guys, but it's typical for a straight male to do that kind of stuff in high school. However he's been really ambivalent and gentle with me lately. Should I confess to him? And how so? I wanna know if there could be a chance for me. For 'us'.¬†

ALSO keep in mind that I don't wanna confess to him to subject to do anything uncomfortable or fabricate a relationship. That's just selfish and out of character for me to do. I, like everybody else, can't change somebody's sexuality and nor should I want to. I've been bottling this up for so long and I don't think it's fair for him to be unaware of how I really see him.

‚Ä¢ We go on a few dates, I ask him where this is going, and he tells me that as much as he likes me, he can never be serious with me (maybe his ex and his mother abandoning him plays some role to this).

‚Ä¢ I go to Brussles with him, he is VERY off with me for the 2 days we are there - to the extent that I decide I won't waste my time with him again. Except, on the way home, he begins showing love and apologises numerous times for acting the way he was, and says ""you deserve someone that treats you amazing"".

‚Ä¢ I go on a few more outings with him, and because I'm no longer in the mind frame of pursuing anything, I am completely and utterly myself. At this point, I have feelings for him, but I know that he doesn't want anything serious with me.

‚Ä¢ He seems to like this organic me, and talks about the future, missing me and wanting to be with me. However, what he doesn't know is that I'm beginning to see another guy from work.

‚Ä¢ I tell him I've been on dates with guy 2, and he begins to hate guy 2.

‚Ä¢ During another outing with ISFP, he mentions that I'm very closed with him, so I tell him to ask me anything - and he asks the last time I slept with guy 2. I tell him that it was a day that ISFP (he) had asked me to meet him, but I didn't have the balls to meet ISFP before I met guy 2 because I felt guilty.

‚Ä¢ He changes completely. Completely put off by me, and says things that cut deep. I ask him to be honest with me and tell me if he sees a future with me. He says that he does, but he doesn't want it. I ask him what that means, and he waffles something along the lines of him not wanting to be in a relationship.

‚Ä¢ Few weeks later, he's still very off and makes weird remarks here and there whilst still flirting with me. 

I don't understand what he's feeling. I've told him numerous times that I want to be serious with him if he wants to be serious with me. But he's hesisitating, and I don't know why. I have feelings for him, and guy 2 is out of my life. ",1545672156

&amp;#x200B;

In case I'm misinterpreting her interest, here are **reasons I believe she's also interested** *(feel free to skip if lazy)*:

‚Ä¢ A LOT of eye contact, \~2 seconds glances from her, caught her side eyeing me and doing a double take, stared for 2 mins straight when I was in front of the class waiting to present, smiled with chin in palm during my 3 min presentation, was fixing her hair and jacket then caught and held eye contact when I was going to walk past her, only looks at the professor and me when speaking in class, strong eye contact when talking/listening to me

‚Ä¢ Touched my shoulder multiple times, walks very close to me (sometimes 2 inches apart), said my name many times in a short conversation, often takes 1-2 steps closer to me during face to face conversations, has leaned in when speaking 

‚Ä¢ Exaggerated interest in the topic I chose to do my speech on without me asking if she likes that stuff, chose a topic very similar to mine, ignored my friend by pretending to laugh when he kept trying to join in our conversation so she could continue speaking to me, walked with me to the library just to leave when she thought I was out of sight, walked my exact same pace (when we haven't ever spoken yet) even when I sped up. She has also said dumb/incorrect things around me. Also when we never spoke yet, she jumped into two of my conversations.

‚Ä¢ Flirted back a little through texts, matched my response times, copies my exact wording sometimes, was excited when I asked for her snapchat, said yes immediately with enthusiasm when I asked her to grab coffee, tweeted love lyrics 4 hours after I asked even though she hasn't tweeted love lyrics in years (and doesn't know I have her Twitter).

\*\*\*

**Here's where I need help:**

*(2 weeks ago)* Even though she agreed to hanging out, that same day she started becoming more unresponsive to texts and she doesn't look at my snapchat stories (Idk if she looks at anyone's but she looked at mine once after replying to my snapchat \[I don't post stories often\]). She flaked on the first hangout then rescheduled a second one just to flake again, both times without saying a single word. However she chose to apologize to me in person instead of texts by approaching me from behind, touching my shoulder and asking to speak to me. She seemed sincere and kept reassuring me to not take it personally and said she's been going through issues. She kept touching me shoulder, walked very close to me, and didn't move when I accidentally brushed against her a few times. She apologized maybe 3 times when I kept telling her it's fine. 

&amp;#x200B;

*(A couple days ago)* After our final, she went to stand directly across from me in the hallways instead of all other spots she could've went to stand. Her feet were pointed towards me even when she was talking to other people. We also kept making eye contact (mostly both at about the same time) when we were both on our phones or listening to other people speaking. Later after class, I touched her arm lightly and her back slightly arched then her eyes stayed glued to the floor during our 10 minute conversation. Her voice was lower and less enthusiastic but she talked nonstop and schooled me about braces, stuttered, and forgot to turn at a certain point in the road (told other people about this; they interpreted it as nervousness). Also even after all the flaking, she still had long glances (thinking I didn't catch her). However she still doesn't reply to me much or takes a long time even though she's on her phone. 

\*\*\*

What do you think is going on? Can any ISFPs relate to any of this? I read online that some ISFPs give mixed signals, especially if they aren't 100% certain the person likes them back. 

&amp;#x200B;

I relate a lot to the descriptions and the cognitive functions, however I struggle to relate to the creativity trait that basically **all** descriptions make us out to have. I know every individual is different but it makes me question my type a lot, especially when we're labelled 'The Artists'. Could it perhaps be enneagram related as i'm a 6 (known for being less creative/artistic, than say a type 4). Anyone else relate or am I probably mistyped?",1545265936
isfp,"Hi guys,

I‚Äôm and INTJ and recently I‚Äôve been thinking about what I‚Äôve observed watching the ISFPs that I‚Äôm close to in my life. Let me start by saying, thank you for existing. You guys can be refreshingly genuine and non judgy in a way that makes even shunned people feel accepted like no other type and naturally, as an INTJ, I appreciate that. I secretly look up to healthy ISFPs for their kindness and noble qualities.

I‚Äôve noticed that ISFPs tend to almost seem to have two sides to them, they‚Äôre normal selves, and also a different side which is more withdrawn and contemplative. When in such a mood, the ISFPs that I know reveal their interest in all types of topics such as spirituality, aliens, the occult, conspiracy theories and all other manner of things typically associated with Ni thinking.

I‚Äôve also seen it the reverse where INTJs have a need for self expression in similar ways to what you‚Äôd associate with ISFPs (having a certain style about them/artistic expression...).

I just thought it was interesting to bring up, as I‚Äôve noticed this pattern with many type combinations i.e. INTPs with inner ISFJs, ENFJs with inner ESTPs, INFJs having an inner ISTP side to them and so on.

I‚Äôve also noticed that when mature these types become more and more indistinguishable and it becomes hard to distinguish a well rounded INTJ from an ISFP for example  just by their appearance and demeanour, and vice versa.

Does this resonate? I‚Äôd like to know your thoughts :)",1545159332

You have this sort of quiet, artistic charisma that makes me want to know what‚Äôs going on in your head. 
  Anyway, all I‚Äôve really seen online is that we are not compatible. I say screw that. But I‚Äôm wondering what do y‚Äôall think of us, the ENTP? ",1545102304

Fair warning, this ended up being a very long, unnecessary post, and I'm also on my phone, so I apologize for any formatting or spelling errors, I'll try to make this into paragraphs as best I can. I'm also not very good with reddit, I mainly read, not post, so bear with me.

I figured I might want to put a trigger warning, if you are sensitive to mentions of violence, depression, or other things to do with mental health, heads up. I don't go into any kind of explicit detail, but it does very briefly get brought up.

Hi guys! What do you all do for self care, stress relief, relaxation, ect? Back when I was a kid (less than 11 years old), I was outdoors in the woods, usually barefoot, all day every day. I climbed trees, explored, all sorts of stuff. I had a trampoline I loved. We had a massive veggie garden I would help tend to, pick veggies, ect. When I was inside, I constantly read books. I started reading Harry Potter, and finished book 6 before I turned 11. I was always creating something, drawing something, painting, coloring, you name it.

 A lot of this, however, was to escape the violence in the household I grew up in. However, at least when I was very young, it was simply an integral part of my being. We miles outside of a small town of less than 900 people, ""in the sticks"". After my mom and stepdad divorced, mom and I moves into said small town, and let's just say wandering town streets and being around so many people just wasn't as interesting as wandering the woods from literally sun up to sun down. I became a house plant. 

I got a gameboy one year, and that was my introduction to the old Pokemon games (Leaf Green!). Several more years, and a few more moves in the same town, and I was still a house plant. I tried a weight lifting class, and track and field and volley ball, however due to issues with my knees and shoulders dislocating easily, I had to stop, and became a permanent couch potato after that.

 I eventually became extremely depressed, due to various other traumatic life events as well, and after years of antidepressants, anxiety meds, and generally not caring, I gained a lot of weight. I believe initially I gained about 40 to 60 pounds in less than two years in high school. I was still very artsy and creative, excelling in my arts, English and science classes. Over time, life has drained all of the spark out of me. 

It's been 5 or 6 years since I graduated high school. Since my freshman year of high school, nearly ten years ago, I've put on probably close to 100 pounds. I can't get my sparkle back. I don't see the point of drawing, or painting, or making things anymore. It serves no functional purpose, so there's no point. I miss being active and feeling my body move and work for me. I miss getting so absorbed into fantasy books about other worlds, but I don't see the point any longer. What I miss the most however, is nature. I've been on a few hikes in the last few years, even tried to pick up running a few times, but nature just doesn't have that child-like wonder and beauty any more. I no longer feel that passion and excitement. 

All my life consists of (especially the past 6 months after having 2 knee surgeries to help fix injuries from those dislocations) is a couch or chair, Netflix and some random video games. Or scrolling on my phone, reading about others' adventures. I want to travel, I want to see things, see different people, different cultures, different worlds, try different food, learn how to create again, how to live again. I plan on looking into therapy here soon, as I know I probably sound pretty depressed. I've been in and out of therapy and on and off medications for depression, anxiety, Self harm, and suicidal thoughts and actions since I was 8, so This is not new to me, but it is tiring.

 This ended up quite a long post, but can any of you relate? What do you guys do for fun? Does such a thing even exist anymore? ",1545085820
isfp,"Does anyone else have more reachable/ realistic fantasies when you day dream?

Like, i dont dream about having a mansion in dubai because i know that would never happen so its not that entertaining to think about. But day dreaming about saving up 40K and building my own 800 sq ft adorable cottage with solar panels and chickens in the back yard is so amazing to think about because its so damn reasonable and attainable.

I dont day dream about becoming a famous rock star but i do daydream about performing a few songs in a coffee shop and selling an ep in a tiny record store.

For me, the more i can envision something actually happening the more i enjoy the day dream. Its sort of like, if you can do it you can dream it rather than if you can dream it you can do it for me. Anyone else find themselves with this inclination?

I guess that makes me less imaginative but its just more fun to think about things that are within my means idk :P",1545074967
isfp,"Met (via Tinder) a girl recently and asked her to take the MBTI test: she is ISFP. I told her in return that I am INTJ. After she had read up a little on 16personalities.com, she proceeded to worry that she wasn't what I was looking for, that she was not good enough, and that I was judging her. Of course, as an INTJ, I also think that is probably true but it seemed like an over-reaction! I really appreciate MBTI and the insights it gives me into the workings of other personality types; I guess the categorisation and simplification of people also appeals to me. This is the first ISFP I have uncovered, and I'm wondering if this is a common reaction, or if there is some past issues that are affecting her? ",1545047771
isfp,"I've always tested as an INFP/ENFP but I have some doubts about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

One thing I read is that ISFPs often will practice technical things for hours on end...I used to sit in the lobby in my university dorm every single day for hours...not because I was practicing, but simply because I enjoyed it...and I'm awful at the guitar.

I'm fiercely competitive, and can turn literally anything into a competition. Even arguments get my blood raging, and I will argue to the death AS LONG AS I HAVE INFORMATION TO BACK ME UP. If the person I'm arguing with comes up with evidence to the contrary or a good hypothetical that makes me rethink my position, I will cede my position and rethink my stance on the issue.

I don't often care to write down my feelings or anything like that, and I'm not the best writer anyway. I have been told I'm a good photographer.

I feel my feelings very strongly...a lot of things ""could"" conceivably make me cry, but I don't allow them to.   
I'm incredibly loyal, even to a fault. I'm very trusting, and I shower my friends/partners with affection and love. I will listen to their problems but also give advice and voice my opinion when they want it. I think my main love languages are #1 touch and #2 gifts. Also, if you attack someone I love physically or emotionally, I will literally launch you into the fucking sun.

 I always go out of my way to make people laugh, especially in large groups...I was always the class clown in school. I dropped out of college after a year because I didn't think I would be very successful...I never cared about homework or assignments in high school, very, very rarely studied for any test and usually did fine anyway. Suck at math.

I take criticism super personally, though I've recently gotten a lot more mentally healthy and my mood has generally been either stressed or totally content. 

I worked construction for a bit, and it was actually quite nice...good money.

I get very fired up about a lot of different things and it's very obvious.

I always dream about future adventures with my best friend (ESTJ), I'm generally the dreamer who wants to take a train ride across America and visit every National Park.

I'm very alert about dangers around me and just generally aware about my surroundings.

I love learning for the sake of learning...I'm sure I've spent hundreds of hours browsing wikipedia.

I don't know, certain things of both describe me.

isfp,"I'm too sensitive to other people, yet it's impossible to avoid people altogether.  Why can't I just be an insensitive asshole like everyone else? It's impossible to describe how much certain people bug me just by standing there looking at me. I can feel their eyes and it feels disgusting. Creeps. Even if they're just walking past me, or standing. These guys have no idea the kind of energy they're putting off. It is gross, and they are disgusting human beings.

Not speaking about all extraverts, cuz I know some and they can be great, but I hate my sensitivity to certain creepy motherfuckers who are so insensitive to the kind of shitty swamp beings they are.

Fuck, I'm sure someone else here can relate? It's a living hell. And I honestly can't even bring myself to talk to these sludge monsters to tell them to fuck off. I feel like I'll be contaminated. 

Sorry if you think this is a bad post cuz it's ""negative"" so will get downvoted, as it is on Reddit, but I honestly just want someone to tell me they know how it feels, so I'm not the only one suffering here.

Sorry if you're personally offended by this post, I know some have already been offended. And no I don't have any form of psychosis. I just know some creeps who will physically growl at me and follow me with their eyes as I walk by. Their negative intentions are clear to me.

isfp,"hi lovelies! I made a new friend recently, an ISFP, and I just want some advice on how to handle the friendship and things with them. Nothing bad has happened, but I really like her and don't want to mess up the friendship so I'm looking for advice prior to any problems. 

im an ESFP and maybe not the best at maintaining healthy long relationships, but this ISFP is someone really special and I want her to be around for super long.

we met thru a tutor site- im 17F and needed a math tutor so she, 19F, tutored me maybe once a week for like about two months. At first we only talked about math but after a month we would drift off into conversation about random things, and laughed a lot and basically i enjoyed her company SO much. then eventually i made the decision to drop this math subject for an easier one that would match my career decision (wedding/events planning). I told her I wasn't gunna need tutoring anymore and this was our last lesson- which i was super sad about- but then I was like, Yo how about lets get dinner! 

she seemed hella keen so we got dinner and totally hit it off!! now as an ESFP y'all probably expect me to be super social, but heres the thing- I dont really get along with people that well. I give off that impression bc I hang a lot w people but there's no one I feel really connected to. HOWEVER this ISFP makes me feel a wHOLE sum different kinda way. we click like heck, we get along SO easily and even when we have different opinions and disagree its still easy and non-conflictive. 

anyways we've only gotten dinner 1x but during that time we agreed upon going on a road trip together (YAY) and saving up and travelling Europe! isnt that great!!! we're also gunna have a movie night and im gunna teach her how 2 make lasagne in like a week or two. i've forreal never been so excited to hang out with a friend before, but i dont want to scare her off/mess up/be a dumb fuck!

do you guys have any advice?????? like how do i approach things w her? how often should we hang?? are there certain things i shouldnt do???

also do you think she likes me (like platonically duh) or do u think she thinks im annoying?  ??  she replies to my texts like a few hours later or maybe 1-2 days later generally but they're always comprehensive, not-short, answers whatever im asking and yes she gives me dates when she is free! she also sends smiley faces! is it just a thing that ISFP's are bad at replying to texts asap? i dont mind but i just get worried bc i highkey textback generally fast.

idk!!! i guess i just want to know

1. what do u think she thinks of me?? 
2. any advice maintaining an ESFP-ISFP friendship. like what should i do to be a good friend and give her space
3. do u think she likes me ?? ? ? or is she just being nice

anyways thank you!!!! I love you guys from what ive seen. Hope ur all doing well and finding ESFP(or whatever) friends who super duper love you too!

sorry if this was a weird post. i just cant stop thinking about it hahaha",1544926004

 **ISFP Care and Handling User Guide and Manual**  
Congratulations! You‚Äôve managed to coax an ISFP out of their favorite hiding spot! Here‚Äôs a handy guide for taking care of and getting to know your quirky and mysterious new friend.  


**Your ISFP comes with:**  


* Ten unique and interesting clothing items
* Two sets of worn and comfy clothes
* One animal friend
* One collection of inspiring photos and/or random objects that are meaningful to your ISFP.
* One set of closely held moral beliefs and values

Custom upgrades: Your ISFP will have multiple creative interests. Books, sports equipment, musical instruments, camping gear, cameras, various art supplies, and random junk may also be included.  


**Software**  
Your ISFP comes preprogrammed with the following traits:  


**Fi:** Makes your ISFP unit independent and sensitive. They may appear aloof or distant, preferring to process their emotions on their own. They‚Äôre actually very warm, loyal, and supportive when you get to know them. Your unit also has a strong moral compass will refuse to do anything that conflicts with their values. Contrary to popular belief, your ISFP is capable of changing their views, but forget trying to force them into doing it!  


**Important note:** Each ISFP will have Fi values, morals, and beliefs that are unique to them. You will need to adapt this general user guide to your specific ISFP Unit.  


**Se:** Your ISFP is very in touch with their physical world and enjoys using their five senses to explore and express themselves. They can be impulsive and adventurous, preferring to live in the moment rather than plan too far ahead. Se also makes them witty and charming and surprisingly cute.  


**Ni:** Your unit will have the need to search for deeper meaning in their life. They will frequently ‚Äúhave a feeling‚Äù about a plan or a person that they will feel compelled to act upon, but not be able to explain. Also makes them incredibly self-critical and may induce occasional bouts of self-doubt.  


**Te:** Your unit may have many dreams, but probably won‚Äôt get around to actually accomplishing most of them (without help, anyway). They can also be stubborn at the inopportune times and unintentionally (and hilariously) blunt when asked to give their opinion.   


**Getting Started**  


1. Sit your ISFP in a quiet room, preferably near a window.
2. Set the animal friend in ISFP‚Äôs lap.
3. Leave ISFP alone for several hours to adjust to their surroundings and bond with the animal friend.
4. Offer ISFP cookies and initiate conversation about the animal friend.
5. If ISFP doesn‚Äôt start, take them to a nearby park and let them wander for a while.

**Modes**  
**Cinnamon Roll Mode (default):** Soft, sweet, and bashful. Prefers to listen to you talk and observe you quietly. Notices everything and knows your favorite food, what kind of car you drive, and probably where you live even though they never asked. (No, it‚Äôs not creepy! They just overheard you giving directions to someone else and didn‚Äôt want to bother you needlessly.) Will make you quirky, adorable (and sometimes baffling) gifts to demonstrate their affection.   


**Creative Mode (default):** Your ISFP has a nearly unmatched creative brain and will often find beauty in their environment. If you don‚Äôt really understand (Yes I‚Äôm talking to you NT types) just voice your support and point out one or two things about their art (or song, or sport, or hobby, or project, or handmade gift/peace offering) that you like. Your ISFP will be flattered and happy that you appreciate their talents and are involved.  


**Adventure Mode:** Your ISFP unit will live for meaningful adventures, and often express longing for the freedom or ability to try new experiences and visit new cultures or sights. Actual chance of them acting on these desires is 50/50, but your ISFP will spend a lot of time daydreaming about it nonetheless.  


**Sensory Recharge Mode:** Your ISFP unit may go dormant after a large social event or adventure. While they enjoy sensory activities, they easily become overstimulated and need time to themselves to process everything they‚Äôre taking in. Forget trying to have conversations with your unit while they‚Äôre in this mode; they‚Äôll quickly excuse themselves and hide.  


**Angry Toddler Mode:** Activated under stress. Your ISFP has become so emotionally overwhelmed (usually due to feeling they are not Good Enough‚Ñ¢) that they just can‚Äôt handle any more. Symptoms include grouchiness, outright refusal to eat or engage in normal activities, and uncharacteristic outbursts of anger. Gently relieve your ISFP of any pressing responsibilities and give them space to express their feelings without judgement.   


**Relationships with Other Units**  
**NF:** ISFP enjoys relationships with NF types, drawn to their emotional depth and idealism. In friendships with these types, ISFP is free to discuss creative ideas and dream big. ISFP will also go to these types for emotional support in times of need.  


**NT:** Your ISFP may not initially gravitate towards NT individuals, as they often don‚Äôt understand their rational nature. However, they are intrigued by the intellect and personality quirks of NT types.  


**SJ:** Your ISFP will want to ride through the glen on their mighty steed, firing arrows into the sunset while the SJ in question will probably want them to calm down, organize, and behave themselves. If not handled carefully, this can result in conflicting goals and thus, stressful relationships.   


**SP**: Your ISFP unit will be most at ease with fellow SPs. They can go on spontaneous adventures together and your ISFP unit is guaranteed to have a couple in their social circle. (Also the #1 culprit when your ISFP randomly disappears.)  


**Feeding**  
Your ISFP unit will have an unusual diet and eating schedule. Mealtimes and snacks tend to happen when ISFP finds it convenient. Don‚Äôt worry about regular meals, your ISFP likes and appreciates food and will make sure that they are eating when they need it.  


**Grooming**  
ISFP is very particular about their appearance. When it comes to hygiene, they tend to stick to the basics, but can be relied upon to take care of themselves. However, If you want them to be on time for something important, remind them to prepare beforehand‚Äã.  


**Sleeping**  
Your ISFP will flip-flop between intensely creative periods where they will forego sleep to work on projects (or go adventuring), and ‚Äúcatch-up‚Äù periods where they will sleep through the day to recharge. Don‚Äôt interrupt your unit‚Äôs sleep times, as this may activate Angry Toddler Mode.  


**Frequently Asked Questions**  
***My ISFP won‚Äôt activate (talk), now what??***  


Stop trying so hard! You can‚Äôt force an ISFP to be your friend. Chances are excellent that ISFP picked up on your efforts to connect from the beginning and is well aware of your intentions. Give them time to observe you and gently coax them out with non-aggressive, non-threatening communication (or fun. Or cookies. Or compliments. Or kittens).  


Also, keep in mind that silence isn‚Äôt necessarily an indicator that your ISFP doesn‚Äôt like you. Often it just means that they‚Äôre thinking; either processing what you have to say or coming up with something to contribute the conversation. Look for these signs instead: does your ISFP go out of their way to spend time with you or do things for you? Do they make eye contact when you‚Äôre talking? If so, they like you.   


***How do I know if my ISFP is doing okay emotionally?***  


Ask them. They rarely open voluntarily, as they don‚Äôt want to be a bother. Keep in mind that it may take some time before they‚Äôll be comfortable sharing with you. When they do talk, listen and validate their feelings. Avoid jumping in and attempting to fix their problems for them or giving your own opinion too quickly. Your ISFP will keep their mouth shut rather than risk subjecting their precious thoughts to unsolicited criticism.  


***My ISFP has disappeared, help!***  


Relax. ISFPs are prone to going AWOL without warning. This doesn‚Äôt mean that they‚Äôre in trouble. They will probably reappear within a day or two with an interesting story about how they went on a last minute road trip with friends and met a eccentric biologist who studies Bigfoot in Tennessee. Resist the urge to check on them too frequently. This will lead to more disappearances (your ISFP is trying to escape from you). If you‚Äôre really worried, casually invite them to get food or do something fun.

After thinking I was an ISTP for a long time, I've finally come to the conclusion that I'm actually an ISFP.

After I got diagnosed with Aspergers last week, I wanted to revisit all the types because now I knew some of my traits are actually because of my Aspergers and not because of my personality. And after doing more research, ISFP just made sense to me, more so than ISTP.

isfp,"Hey there. I‚Äôve been trying to type myself for the past while and I think I might be an ISFP! Here‚Äôs some things about me but if you need me to clarify something then just ask!

- I love doing art and anything creative. I have a very specific art style. I like my art to be pretty on the eyes but also a style that is unique to me. Something that matches my personality. I keep having reoccurring dreams of me having a pet lion so that has been inspiring some of my paintings lately!

- I love pottery. It‚Äôs quite expensive so I don‚Äôt really do it but I love the feeling of the wet clay in my hands and creating something. 

- I do travel. I love seeing new places and new things. I kinda spontaneously booked a trip to France with my two friends. Obviously I made sure I had the funds first but I‚Äôm very go with the flow so I was like ‚ÄúThis sounds fun!‚Äù 

- I hold my background close to me. I am Persian/Canadian. Being Persian is an important part of who I am! I love sharing my culture with others if they‚Äôre interested. 

- I write songs and I journal but I don‚Äôt share it with anyone. In fact I don‚Äôt even tell people I write songs because they may ask to see and the answer is no because they are my about my feelings and I don‚Äôt really like to share how I feel. I suck at it! 

- I believe that 4 good friends are better than having 20 alright friends

- I really value my family time, meditation, and just balancing my feelings. I tend to overthink and have anxiety so if I‚Äôm worried about something, I‚Äôll tell one person who‚Äôs super close to me how I feel. Usually my ISFJ roommate

- I also love to cook. The spicier the better! I love to cook for people but only if it‚Äôs my best dishes. I only give people the best that I can do. 

- I‚Äôm always late for things and suck at maintaining a routine. As long as I go to the gym as some point during the day I‚Äôm good. 

- Even though I suck at maintaining a routine, I do keep an agenda to help me remember things. 

- I‚Äôm interested in fashion and makeup. I always like to look my best. My clothing style definitely represents who I am

- I‚Äôm very easy going and calm, I don‚Äôt take things personally and get offended easily but I do have values that are important to me. Honesty, non judgmental, empathetic, and humbleness is really important to me. I already know exactly what I want in a partner and I do prefer it if my friends and boyfriend have these values. To me, a genuine person is honest with themselves and with the others around them. I have my own opinions, and I don‚Äôt like it when people are harsh on others or myself.  It‚Äôs best to put yourself in the other persons shoes and be like ‚Äúhow would I feel if I were in their position?‚Äù ",1544506526
isfp,"Hi ISFPs. This is my first reddit post, and it is because I have reached a miniature revelation that makes me nervous. I know that this may sound silly, but I have found that every man I've ever had a serious crush on happens to be an ISFP. I wish that I could calm my heart, but I don't know what to do.

These musings feel heavy on my chest, and it is with embarrassingly high disappointment that I read about how incompatible many people seem to think we are--INFPs and ISFPs. It feels a bit ugly of me. I feel like some sorta perverse and sweaty weirdo to have the thought of an MBTI type make my heart race... I just find you guys so mysterious and alluring! When I think of having a pleasant conversation with an ISFP, I feel vulnerable, like the butterflies inside me are pulling my strength away. You are all just so talented and cool!! I would love to bond with someone who is so similar yet so different to what I am familiar with. I want to learn one-on-one how you all see the world...I want to learn more about you... Maybe this isn't so bad, but I'm unsure. I know some other types that tend to find me interesting, but I can't definitely say that I've interacted with any ISFPs. I'm quite afraid that they will find me insufferably boring. I really am sorry if I sound like a huge ole creep right now. I don't know what else to say...Please, is there any advice for this sort of thing? Sorry if I sound strange in the bad way, and thank you for reading my post!",1544502147

isfp,"Just like the Krishnamurti quote: 

‚ÄúThe day you teach the child the name of the bird, the child will never see that bird again.‚Äù

All words are essentially labels that attempt to describe something. But if we get too attached to words (I see so many people doing things), maybe we‚Äôll never embrace them for what they actually *are* - feelings, experiences, and sensations that would just be murdered if we put them into words. 

I‚Äôm not saying we should give up on words completely (although I‚Äôm guilty of this on occasion), but I think we should understand that there‚Äôs so much more to life that we could possibly cage into two to twelve letter words, just for other people to read in books, or share at a dinner table. For some experiences of mine, I think they‚Äôd be ruined if I tried to describe them (to most people). 

We can save a lot of energy by not going into so much detail about a lot of beautiful things. (And preserve the sanctity of them, too.)

I think a lot of people get so caught up in wanting to understand everything, just so that they can feel more dominant and in control of those things. This, I think, could possibly be for a false sense of security. 

But the truth is, we can never really know everything. I appreciate knowledge, of course. But in my opinion, there are some things in this world that are better left untouched, or unexplained. 

Maybe there‚Äôs something special in letting go of some control, and understanding that our time on this earth and our knowledge of this world are both extremely limited, so it could be a better use of time to just go and live, instead of endlessly trying to put simple things into words.

- easy. Its simple. All you do is wash stuff and sometimes take out trash for 6 hours then you leave. No multitasking. No dealing with the public!! I find the time flys by.

- people leave you alone for the most part. Just wash the dishes and youre fine. No drama.

- Pay. The pay varies from place to place but its usually better than minimum wage. Im getting $10.50/hr which is not amazing but its the most I've made so far.

- free food. Im sure this varies from place to place too but i get 1 free meal per shift and the foods amazing.

isfp,"So I‚Äôm an aspiring photographer, yada yada, and I was invited to assist a big industry photo shoot with a very well known model on a very last minute. (My genre of photography is documentary so it‚Äôs not really my scene, but I do portraits too.....) 

It would‚Äôve taken me an hour to get there from where I lived, and the shoot would‚Äôve been mostly over by then, so I said I‚Äôd pass. The friend who invited me said I could come anyway, and just hang out with everyone after the shoot.

There are ten models total at this shoot. I could network, and really make some great connections with these people and maybe photograph them later. 

But.

First of all, I‚Äôve been feeling ESPECIALLY less talkative as of late. Very private and shut-in. I can spend a very long time indoors just working on my side business where I sell templates, then go out for a few hours to shoot street photography for an upcoming gallery exhibit, then come back and binge watch YouTube until I sleep.

Something about getting invited to meet all these models after the shoot not only made me nervous, but weirdly, very stubborn. Just taking the time to show up and introduce myself would‚Äôve helped me a lot, especially because I‚Äôm very good friends (we met outside of our careers) with the main photographer, and he‚Äôs said wonderfully sweet things about this well known model. But when I almost said yes to the offer, my brain started yelling, ‚ÄúNOOOO!! You can‚Äôt make me!! I will not assimilate with society and meet these established models, even though it would probably greatly benefit your career!!!!! Aaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!‚Äù 

So I said no. I would‚Äôve 100% said yes if I was in the area and if I could‚Äôve been a bigger part of what‚Äôs important - the *actual shoot*. But even just stopping by to introduce myself and chat with these industry professionals would‚Äôve been AMAZING, yet I had already entered a ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt make me &gt;:(‚Äú mode where I felt ‚Äúthreatened‚Äù by social expectations, even though it would‚Äôve probably been a good learning experience if I had just shut up and went either way.

After that, I also realized I've had bad experiences with ESTJs, ESFJs, ESTPs and ESFPs. Well, that leaves out ENFPs (who tend to be very draining to hang out with) and ENFJs (who I find alright but wouldn't really have a deep friendship with).

Then I also realized literally almost all of my good friends and family members I'm close with are introverts. I only have one ESFP friend, but I don't really see him anymore.

Personally if someone rubs me the wrong way, I'll dislike them no matter the context or circumstances, but INFPs seem to always try and understand the other's viewpoint before making any judgements.

Fi aux-es (ESFP &amp; ENFP)

Honestly, I really don't understand Fi aux. It seems like it's actually not there, and their users are just using Se or Ne nonstop. Heck, sometimes they even seem like ESTPs or ENTPs if they're being mean or serious.

Fi tertiaries (ISTJ &amp; INTJ)

Pretty cool. It's kinda like Fi dom, but more in the background. For whatever reason Fi seems more subdued with ISTJs to me. It also seems like they can get even more intense when their Fi gets violated than Fi doms sometimes.

Fi inferiors (ESTJ &amp; ENTJ)

I *think* I have 2 INTP friends (one typed as INTJ first but is definitely an INTP, and the other *could* be an ISTJ or an INTP, but I'm leaning more towards INTP), one who I've never met irl but sometimes talk to on IRC or Telegram, and one who I went to high school with, but don't really talk to anymore (nor do I really talk to any of my other high school friends, but that's another story). The first one goes reasonably well most of the time, but I always have to be the one to initiate conversation, and he tends to be very curt and to the point. He also takes extremely long to reply, (personally I almost always reply asap, can't stand having to let others wait) and sometimes he doesn't reply at all. The ""read at x:xx PM"" meme rings true. If I come to him with a question he'll answer it most of the time, though. But if I just come to him with anything else it's either ""ok"" or ""read at x:xx PM"", and very rarely a ""lol"".

As for the second friend, out of all my high school friends I talked to him the least. No particular reason, it just happened to be that way. Whenever we were alone we would talk, but it's very obvious that we come from very different perspectives. I remember talking to him about PC and consoles (I'm a very strong PC guy, generally dislike consoles), and he just listed various reasons why consoles are better, with a very subdued tone that just seems to imply ""*obviously* it is"".

Note: Im INFJ; Dave is ENFP; Daniel is ISFP

Two years I fell in love with Dave (F18). But I was in denial about my feelings so I did not did anything about it. Six months later he got a girlfriend (F18) and they are happily together since then. Their relationship is stable. Meanwhile I suffered in silence. I was really lovesick. For example I felt at some point even unable to sleep and to eat (I lost as a result 8 lbs ;im still barely not underweight). I always thought that I would be forever alone.

Over times is got better. I am able again to function normally in life and Im reasonably happy. But I still think every day of Dave. So I m not totally over him.

Yesterday a guy whom I will call Daniel asked me out for a date. Daniel is a friend (but not an extremely close friend) of mine since five years. 

I told him that I know this is really unfair to him but I cant answer him right now whether I want to go on a date with him. I feel terrible for leaving him in limbo and treating him like that, but I just felt unable to give him an even half part reasonable answer.

I feel like dating him is a great opportunity for me to forget Dave and I think that Daniel and I might be a good match. I like him a lot and I love spending time with him.

On the other hand I am terribly afraid of starting to date. And I still cling far too much too the past. Also I am afraid that I might be emotionally not healthy and stable enough to date. I often think that I am unlovable.

Also I fear that I might hurt Daniel or myself by doing something stupid. I absolutely don‚Äôt want to hurt Daniel or loose his friendship.

For example, I might be feeling a little shy so I‚Äôll make an extra effort to be outgoing, then they think I‚Äôm outgoing, and then I want them to leave me alone or I feel misunderstood. Hahaha

Like, I make no sense to myself. I‚Äôm serious but laidback, ambitious but lazy, mature but immature, can be outgoing to make a room comfortable but very antisocial right after. I have so many contradicting qualities that it confuses me, as it confuses my friends and family.

I really envy people who can just unapologetically be themselves, despite weirding people out with how unique and honest they were. I wish I didn‚Äôt care what people thought so much; it makes me really secretive without realizing it.

It‚Äôs not other people‚Äôs faults that I don‚Äôt get along with them, it‚Äôs mine. (Ok, I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs not true, but that‚Äôs what it feels like.) But even if people knew me better, I bet not much would change. I don‚Äôt know. Just thinking out loud

He gets very annoyed at me when I do this and tries to get me to connect more with my feelings in the present moment. I understand the value in this, and it's helped me a lot, but I also don't think that trying to understand the other person is necessarily a bad thing. But when he does this (he tells me that I'm being dumb and annoying when I do this), he makes me feel very ashamed and down. I'm trying to understand why he would say or do this.

isfp,"I‚Äôm fairly certain that I have Fi, but unsure if it‚Äôs dominant or auxiliary. I wrote a description of myself awhile back that was based on how others saw me, traits I saw in myself, and tried to cover different areas in my life. I got mixed results, a lot of ESFP and INFP. I‚Äôve read about both and I can easily see myself as both, but I know I can only possibly be one, and I‚Äôm stumped trying to find out. 

I‚Äôll make my case for each and try to include my motivations as well.  

**My main reasons for INFP** are the Fi-Si loop: I‚Äòm sentimental and nostalgic about certain events in my past and love sharing them because I‚Äôm not ready to let them go, and I‚Äôd like to think those around me care as much as I do. I have a lot of photos and remember the specific dates of the events that were emotionally relevant for me, again because I don‚Äôt want to forget, I believe that they aren‚Äôt truly gone unless you forget about them. I don‚Äôt care about my appearance as much, I obviously take care of hygiene but I rarely deviate from my normal clothing style because it‚Äôs comfortable, that and because I freaking hate clothes shopping in general haha. I don‚Äôt display a lot of your average Se traits, I‚Äôm pretty clumsy and uncharismatic, and you could see my cringe-worthy and awkward movements from a mile away if you saw me in real life. I‚Äôm not sure if this would be attributed to inferior Te or not, but I‚Äôm pretty un-assertive and I don‚Äôt like taking the lead for random things just for the sake of taking the lead. It‚Äôs not that I dislike the attention, I just hate asserting myself and trying to act as an authority figure. I wouldn‚Äôt like being above people, I‚Äôd rather be equal and liked than higher and powerful, and plus the added responsibility and pressure is not worth it for me. If it‚Äôs something that I‚Äôm truly passionate about though, I‚Äôm absolutely the first to speak up and let everyone know, whether I not I‚Äôd really ‚Äútake the lead‚Äù that depends, but I definitely show a lot of excitement and enthusiasm if something I‚Äôm passionate about hits. 

**My main reasons for ESFP:** I feel like I‚Äôm too trusting and enthusiastic about the company of people to be an INFP. I‚Äôve gotten feedback about being very na√Øve and open to strangers even as a child. Canceled social plans just cut so deep for me, I can‚Äôt even explain the overwhelming disappointment when I‚Äôm looking forward to hanging out and then it just gets rescheduled or cancled. I love being with people, especially when they allow me to be who I am and let me show my real self. I love telling stories, making friends, laughing my ass off, and being well known in the community/social life. I feel absolutely furfilled and hyped after a fun social night and I can‚Äôt relate to needing to immediately go home and be alone to recharge. Whole I don‚Äôt mind my alone time, I usually just use it to watch shows or make memes or something, I rarely ever go deep into my thoughts and get extremely depressed if I do. Life is awesome and I think being existential and over-complicated makes things really depressing and weighed down for no reason. I‚Äôve never really seen myself as intuitive, in fact I‚Äôve even gotten feedback for not thinking about future implications, ‚Äúyou need to look at the big picture,‚Äù think about the long-term etc. I sometimes blurt things out without realizing the consequences and doing absolutely retarded things in the moment and then physically cringing at myself as I look back and reflect on it. It looks like a great idea and it looks like the best option at the time, so I‚Äôd go ahead and then it just blows up in my face.

isfp,"In response to some posts i have seen where IxFPs call people who open up to them ""toxic"" and claim they were ""forced to ghost them"". People who share everything with you are not necessarily toxic, and it is most certainly not ENTIRELY their fault that they have one sided conversations with you. Friendships involve give and take, which means if they share with you a lot, it might be nice to do the same. Can you truly blame them for expecting a little bit of trust from a person who they trust so much? 

 You Fi doms often have issues with sharing and communicating. Sure you are great listeners, but what if somebody actually wants to get to know you? I know in my case i was head over heels and i wanted to become closer, i thought if i shared with her she would share with me... nope. She continued to treat me like i was nobody. When i said that i liked her, she told me she ""wasn't ready for a relationship"" instead of telling me the truth (she just doesn't like me that way)... which i eventually dragged out of her. AND I WAS FINE WITH THAT. She said she wanted to stay friends, and i believed her. But all of a sudden, no texts, no hanging out, no saying hi at church... and when i asked her about it she made a bunch of excuses, and told me that she was distant with ALL her friends... who i clearly saw her talking to and laughing with whilst she ignored me... I wasnt mad that she didn't share, I wasnt mad that she didnt care about me, i was furious that she lied to me and caused me to waste so much time and effort. I made an effort to tell her the truth, in all the time i knew her, and all she ever did was play along. And when things got even the tiniest bit uncomfortable, she kicked me out of her life, and LIED to me because she was to scared to tell me the truth.

I know there were an awful lot of ""I""s and ""me""s in this post... but i just want to let everyone on this sub know that ghosting, ignoring and lying are INFINITELY worse than just telling the truth and getting it overwith.

isfp,"Hello, ENTJ 20 F here 
-Main question: what to do when (M) ISFP pulls away 
-specific story at end, sorry it‚Äôs long 

I‚Äôve been reading through the ISFP sub, and have gathered that majority of y‚Äôall do a lot of pulling away / ghosting when you‚Äôre interested in someone. I suspect this of the ISFP M 21 I am interested in. 

So, my question is, what do y‚Äôall suggest I do during the ghosting periods? 

-specifics 
Ok, so I met as ISFP male, and at that time I did not know he was ISFP. 
We met in a group setting, and immediately he was always near me and would try to have single conversation with me. He started the joke that I was his girlfriend. It was his roommate and my friend all hanging out. His roommate went to bed, my friend has fallen asleep (it was late and we were all watching movies) and so it was him and I just talking. My friend suddenly woke up and asked to go home, so we did. 
Right away, he followed me and dm me on insta, and asked to hangout the following day (also exchanged numbers). He invited me to a super small get together of his closest friends, and we ended up back at my
House. 
We talked for a long time, and ending up making out and he stayed the night. 
A day after, he sent me a picture over Instagram DM (reminder: we have each other‚Äôs numbers) 
I didn‚Äôt open it for three days(I was trying to play it cool), and when I did it was of a black screen (when you put your finger over the camera and it‚Äôs just a black picture) 

I asked him to my sorority formal, and he did not even reply. Three weeks later. He sends a long message apologizing and all that. I didn‚Äôt reply for two days, not to play it cool, but because I don‚Äôt put up with that stuff. But I kind of sensed he was sensitive, so I gave it another chance. 

We ended up agreeing of meeting at the bars that same Thursday night I replied, and the entire time he was very attentive, I met his other close friends, and he was just very focused on me in a not weird way. 

We ended up going home again to my house and again we talked for such a long time before booking up. He is very into cuddling, so after when we were talking and such I asked him to take a personality test (it went along with our conversation and I was curious) and the entire time I could feel his nervous ness because his heart was beating very rapidly and he was breathing funny because I could see his responses (I asked if it was okay that I could see his responses and he said yes)

A day after this event, I texted him to hangout and again, completely no response 

The next day was a different even for my sorority that he was going with his friend group to, and the person I was going with is one of his roommates funnily enough (the same one who went to sleep the day we all first met, this was set up before we met from my friend who also fell asleep the first night) 

When we got there, we found came across him and from far away we made eye contact, and eventually he ended up at my side 
During that conversation, very randomly he mentioned that last night his best friend that recently broke up with his gf wanted to go to the bars and he went with him for a short bit. It was almost like an indirect apology, and when he said it he just looked straight ahead, not me

I personally take this as guy behavior of not interested, but I‚Äôve had random hookups, and honestly, I don‚Äôt know if this is because ISFPs are more sensitive and deep that the hooks ups with this ISFP are more like relationship like with our deep conversations and how he pays more attention to my pleasing than his and the staying overnight and cuddling, or if it is the ISFP‚Äôs pulling away / ghosting when they get feelings 
With other random hookups, they are always fast and always the guy just wanting to get pleased and then leave 

So, if the case is feelings, what do y‚Äôall as ISFP suggest we do during the ghosting phases? What can I do to make sure you feel reassured? Or to encourage you? 

Thanks! ",1541131499

isfp,"I've been a very private person all my life and for the first time I feel like getting some things off my chest.

I was born in a lower class family in Portland, Oregon, youngest of six kids (all half siblings). My parents were drug addicts. Closest sibling to me in age is my only sister, six years older than me. Only sibling I had still living with my parents (and not their other parent) was one of my brothers (14 years older than me). My dad used to beat him and the police would be called often by the neighbors to check on things. He left when he was 17 to live with my oldest brother, which left me alone in a crack den with my parents.

They lost their jobs, trashed the house, stopped paying the mortgage, and within a few months of my brother leaving we were homeless. We got in a van with two of my cousins and went south to East Oakland. We mostly stayed in projects where drugs were readily available and where I witnessed things I shouldn't have at that age (for instance, a murder).

One day when I was five, my parents had this old guy in his 60s (coulda been younger and drugs could've aged his face) watch me while they walked to the store (we were staying at this guy's house). The moment the doors closed and my parents were gone, the guy hurried me upstairs and immediately raped me. It was over in mere minutes and I had expected my parents to show up any minute. He picked me up again, walked to me to the window and held me out it. I screamed and he whispered in my ear ""You ever tell anyone about this and I won't hesitate to fucking kill you."" I could see my parents in the distance. They screamed and ran towards the house. My dad beat the guy unconscious, but I never told him (or anyone) what he did to me.

Fast forward to when I was six (I wasn't in school yet). We were staying in a motel in San Francisco then (I don't know how we were affording it). One of my cousins had disappeared over the past few days and we didn't know where he was off to. Then randomly the door was thrashed down and a swat team came in. Apparently, while my cousin had disappeared, he'd failed an armed bank robbery and literally accidentally shot a hostage, and told the police that my dad had been involved in planning it.

My dad was arrested, I was sent to a foster care, and my cousin is now on parol. Foster care was the worst experience of my life but I was only there for a month. They were physically abusive and were only doing it for a tax write off or something (I still don't know the specifics). I was very severally bullied by the kids there.

My dad managed to prove he wasn't a part of the robbery. He got me out of the foster care and drove me up to my oldest brother's house (he lived directly across the water from Seattle). Told me he'd be back in three days to pick me up. He never came back.

My brother adopted me and enrolled me in the school his wife taught at. They had a family of their own and I was never treated the same as their children. My future friends referred to them as ""the Dursleys."" I was a few years older than their oldest kid so I attribute their shitty parenting to not knowing how to raise a kid my age at that point yet, because they were much kinder to their kids when they reached my age. They were also quite religious.

When I arrived in Washington, I hadn't brushed my teeth in years and my diet consisted of a bag of skittles and a coke a day so I had a cavity on every tooth and half of them had to be pulled. Thankfully, as I hadn't had secondary teeth for as long as my primary teeth, the most I needed for them was fillings.

I didn't know my ABCs or how to count past 12 at that point, so when I came to school for the first time I instantly became infamous for being stupid. At recess every day kids would beat me and I'd come home every day covered in bruises. They treated me so much worse than uneducated kids in the hood ever did. I told my sister-in-law about it and, despite working there and being the teacher of some of those kids, they never faced any punishment. And it irked me so much that she was the most liked teacher in the school, because every day I had to see a different side of her that her students didn't see.

I didn't learn anything that year and had to be held back (my birthday was in the summer so nobody in the future knew that I was held back thankfully). I repeated first grade and within a few months I was learning beyond what was expected. In December I was learning multiplication and by the year's end I was at a fourth grade reading level. My teachers told my sister-in-law everything. This lead to some good things, such as her knowing I was top of my class in every subject; but this also led to me being punished at home for the littlest things I'd do at school. They also told her how often I was drawing in class (which was a huge passion of my mine), and I was punished for it which greatly discouraged me and I quit. I was writing poems but gave up on that as well.

I didn't really make any great friends during my time at that school, merely acquaintances; but I also didn't have to endure any more bullying.

Something that should be mentioned is that around this time one of my brothers died of an overdose. It caused me to feel very depressed for a short while.

In third grade when I was nine, after my brother had another kid, we moved into a larger house, but we were still in a very poor area. I instantly became friends with the kids on the street, and it was here that I experienced the best years of my life. Every day here felt like an adventure, and my friends and I weren't exactly popular but we were the school's most infamous troublemakers (and my sister-in-law didn't know about any of it, thank God). Every day after school we went to the street's cult-a-sack (I have no idea how you spell it) and just hung out. We usually played baseball or hung out at a friend's house playing Minecraft and GTA IV all day. We had plenty of ""adventures"" that aren't really worth getting into in this post, but I could probably talk about them for hours.

Summers were incredible. We'd walk down to the beach and swim most days, other days we'd find shit to get into, and other days we'd sit there playing games and eating shitloads of candy at our ""cool"" friend's house. His mom was a drug addict and didn't give a shit what we did; we were free to walk in and out of their house whenever we felt like it. We practically lived there, and I stayed the night as often as I could because his mom was much nicer to me than my brother. Any time I spent too long around my sister-in-law, I was bound to get grounded.

In seventh grade my brother told me he was sending me to a different school that was on an island because he didn't like the influence poor kids were having on me.

Every day I woke up at 4, got on a bus and got on the ferry (with about 40 other kids) to go to ""the best public school in the northwest.""

I had football practice every day which screwed things up for me because I had to wait 50 minutes to catch the bus and then another hour at the ferry terminal (the schedules were not synchronized very intuitively). Every night I got home at 8:30 and finished my homework and went to bed at 10:30. I had no free time whatsoever, and I had to try my absolute best to maintain a 4.0 GPA.

After the first semester, they put me in an eighth grade class because they thought I could handle it. It was shit. I instantly became the butt of everybody's jokes in that class and they constantly belittled and antagonized me. Couple this with my growing depression at the cause of having no free time, and my grades began to slip steadily from straight A's to... straight F's.

Weekends at home were terrible because I was forced to be around my brother and his wife because of how much homework I had. I constantly got in fights with them; they'd accuse me of things I didn't do and it'd often end violently; one instance in particular ended with my brother making a hole in the wall with my head that they blamed on me.

They told me that my parents were clean now and lived in Portland again, and said that I'd be moving back in a month. They had me visit them once before I moved in so I could ease into things. I told my sister-in-law about how they visited what was very obviously their dealer while I was there but she dismissed it.

Knowing that my life was about to go to shit in two weeks, I decided I was giving up on trying. One day while playing basketball in the eighth grade class (it was a special occasion), I fouled a kid and he got pissed off and punched me. My response wasn't an immediate reaction. I stood there for maybe fifteen seconds and thought about what I'd do next. I punched him as hard as I possibly could in the face. He collapsed on the ground and began sobbing uncontrollably. The whole class promised him they were on his side and that they wouldn't tell anyone that he swung first. When I walked past the health room an hour later he was still sobbing uncontrollably. My version of events wasn't believed due to ten other witnesses denying it and I was expelled immediately.

I got home and unexpectedly my bags were already packed. My sister-in-law walked up to me, gave me an insincere hug, and said ""Your actions have consequences. You're going to Portland two weeks early."" I asked if I could say goodbye to my nieces and nephews and friends and she said ""no."" I began crying like I hadn't since I was five years old as they forced me into the car.

I got to my parents' section 8 apartment in downtown Portland two hours later. They'd forgotten to pack me underwear and my parents couldn't afford any so I had a shitty first week.

After week of me being there my dad attempted suicide. I walked in the bathroom and he was laying in the bathtub choking on his own puke and I had to drag his naked body out of the bathtub. I emailed my sister-in-law that evening asking if I could please come back and she said I'd just have to figure out how to make it work.

The next week I started school. During the first few days I thought things were going great. That ended when after talking to some pretty girl next to me her asshole ""boyfriend"" decided to spread a rumor that I was gay, and everybody believed it. For the second time in my life I was being physically bullied. Kids would hit me and I didn't want to face another expulsion. When I walked to the bus every day heads would turn and fingers and would point and I'd hear from everybody things like ""he sucks cock"" and ""he tried to grab my dick.""

Any time I had to be around people at this school was tormenting. I didn't eat and instead I'd sit in the bathroom at lunch, which lead to me becoming anorexic for a short while.

I didn't have anything to look forward to at the end of each day either. When I came home my parents were wasted and there was usually several other wasted people home as well. Surprisingly, I got to know a lot of these people very well and I liked most of them a lot actually (they all just seemed like kind people who'd had lives as shitty as mine). Sadly, many of them have died which hurts me every time.

In ninth grade I decided I was going to an alternative school instead. At this point I had no excuse for continuing to get straight F's but that's what I did. Despite going to a school that was very supportive for everybody, my depression got the better of me and my attendance hit about 60%.

This was such a forgettable year that I only remember one day from it. We were partnered up in English to read over each other's essays about the person who's had the biggest influence on you. I was partnered with the ""popular pretty girl"" and miraculously, we both were writing our essays about SpongeBob. That two hour class felt like the best two hours of my life and I can't ever remember enjoying talking to someone that much. Anyways, her and I didn't talk again that year.

Last year however (tenth grade) we did. On the first day, for whatever reason, she chose to sit next to me. She had these Legos in her hand she was fidgeting around with. I'd developed horrid social anxiety and I shook badly when most people talked to me, but for whatever reason I was calm when she talked to me. For the first time in my life I felt I could be myself. It turned out we both loved music and we spent the whole day in each class discussing our favorite albums. She gave me her number and at the end of the day as I was walking out the door she ran to me and said ""Here! You can have these,"" and she handed me the Legos, which I still have today.

I was in a state of euphoria for the next few months. I was going to school every day and somehow I was getting A's again. I now had someone I could spend hours talking to who shared all the same interests as me. We'd sit under a tree and talk after school for an hour each day. In class she'd laugh at all of my shitty jokes, rest her feet on mine and look at me like I'd never seen anyone look at anyone.

She came from a very different background than me. She lived just a few blocks away from downtown in a three story house that was as wide as it was tall. God knows how much that thing's worth, but it has to be in the millions. Despite having completely different life experiences, I felt like I'd never had more in common with someone.

One day that December she sent me a text telling me to follow her other Instagram account. I clicked the link and it was a private account with zero followers and three posts and an over-the-top sarcastic sexual name. I followed it, having no idea what it was. And it was nudes.

I had no idea how to respond. I'd never been this close to a girl before. I got scared and said nothing, and an hour later I was blocked from the private account. I took this to mean she now hated me, so I immediately began texting her something along the lines of ""You're my only friend in this state and I don't want to lose that."" I now realize this sounds like I was friend-zoning her, when in fact I felt like I was completely in love. She just texted back ""It's okay.""

The next day at school, she did not sit next to me and I was alone again. Prior to meeting her, it felt like I was disconnected from everybody else, but now that I'd felt a connection to someone it was something I wanted to feel again so badly.

I no longer saw a reason to come to school. I developed insomnia and a terrible sleeping pattern. I'd wake up at a completely different time every day and just spend the time I was awake at school (which sometimes amounted in a week without showing up due to being completely nocturnal). My grades went straight back to F's. Every day became a blur.

Every day I'd tell myself I was over this girl but I'd see her at school and instantly be reminded of how much I liked her. Every time I saw her I almost wanted to cry. Throughout the year I kept trying to ""win her back"" by forcing intimacy by telling her things about my past I'd never told anyone (never told her about being raped though). This just made her think I was weird.

On the first day of summer I noticed she'd blocked me on all forms of social media and I no longer had a way to talk to her. I at least wanted some closure at that point but it was clear I wasn't going to get it.

Every night that summer I walked to the only tall building in the suburbs. It was quieter out there so I could listen to music and ponder my feelings peacefully. When I got to the building, I'd walk up the stairs of its companion parking garage building and tell myself I was gonna jump. Each night I'd convinced myself I'd do it and I (obviously) never did.

In the middle of summer I went to see my friends in Washington. I told them about my shitty situation at home and they immediately began thinking up ways to help me out of it and were determined to help, as they'd all experienced similar things at some point. I can't really express what it meant to me, and despite never feeling my family loved me, I feel that these friends are more than enough.

Anyways, on the first day of school, I looked across the room and saw the girl talking to another guy and looking at him the same way she once looked at me, and it sounds pathetic but I felt like I was about to cry. Later on that day we were put into groups of three in a different class and I was partnered with the girl and some other dude. While we were doing our group project she ignored me but whispered extremely loudly to the other guy about her masturbatory experiences and comparing what it was like with and without a vibrator, which seemed like an attempt to make me... jealous? I don't know. It was weird as hell.

When I got home that day I saw a text that said ""Hi"" and it was from her. I immediately swiped right and wanted to answer immediately. Up to that point, I'd thought that a text from her would've made my day, my week, maybe even my year. But I stopped halfway through typing in my passcode and asked myself ""Do I even like her anymore?"" And the answer was no. So I didn't respond.

Now I don't know what to do. I'm a Junior and I've only passed eight classes in high school, and I currently have straight F's. I grew up being told I'd go to Harvard. I'm too smart to be doing this and I've wasted any potential I had.",1541028794

isfp,"I was almost positive that my friend was an IxFJ, but our recent conflict has lead me to believe otherwise. For reference, I‚Äôm an xNFJ. I could tell that my friend was upset with me because he started ignoring me and making passive aggressive comments. Me being me, I wanted to talk it out and have a productive conversation about what was going on and wanted to know how he was feeling, so I could fix things. 

My friend refused to tell me what was going on, even after I begged him to, claiming that he wouldn‚Äôt tell me because it was his business. I finally confronted him again. I explained to my friend that it was keeping me up at night, because I didn‚Äôt know what was going on with him and didn‚Äôt know what I did wrong. He didn‚Äôt seem to care that by not opening up to me, he was creating emotional stress in my life. 

Several days later I finally got the truth out of him. Apparently I was getting on his nerves because I kept messaging him, asking him how he was doing and he doesn‚Äôt like to talk to people all the time and needs time alone. I asked if it was really so difficult for him to tell me this after I BEGGED him to and he said, ‚Äúyes, because it required feeling.‚Äù 

I know he‚Äôs a feeler, because pretty much all the decisions he makes are based on how he‚Äôs feeling. I just find it strange for a feeling type to have such trouble opening up and talking about how they feel, even when it‚Äôs such a small thing that‚Äôs bothering them.

isfp,"They're kind of a morbid obsession of mine, generally I really dislike them, but I'm also very intrigued by them at the same time. Kinda like how a villain in a game or anime usually takes most of my attention.

But anyways, I generally find them rather odd. They kind of feel like real people acting like characters from fiction, just not.. real.

First off there's that childlike and playful vibe they have, kinda like an ENFP, but with a very mean bite behind it all. Kinda like how in some media there are villains that act cutesy, cheery and bubbly, but deep within they're just thinking of ways to kill and torture as many people as possible. It's almost like they're some sort of evil robot that's disguised as a teddy bear.

What also really mystifies me is how they tend to be so well-liked by others. I mean, they say pretty much everything that comes up in their heads, whether or not it's appropriate. Heck, as far as I can tell they enjoy it even more if someone does get offended. It's almost like only ISFPs can see their ""real form"", whereas they wear a disguise that makes them seem acceptable to other people.

Their lack of Fi is also really weird to me. Then again, as a Fi dom I guess that's natural, but I don't really seem to notice this all that much in ESTPs. ENTPs are pretty much the Anti-Fi. We can talk about this all we want, but I guess this is just something I will never get, so whatever.

Buuuuuut I've also seen a couple of ENTPs that just act rather formal and don't really try to step on your toes. I guess those are the more mature ones? They seem alright.",1540579736

They seem to think ""wow this girl is willing to listen to me talk about my problems for 7 hours straight - she must be obsessed with me!! I love that about her! Must. Never. Let. Her. Go.""

When I start to back off (after months, sometimes years) of being there for them, giving them all the support and company I can give them and never getting anything back, they get angry and either start stalking me or trying to emotionally destroy me.

I feel like he genuinely cares for me but he is really confused about his life and isn‚Äôt treating me the best. He seems stuck in a rut and I have been using MBTI to try understand and help him but I don‚Äôt know how I can help him if he keeps shutting me out. I knew he was introverted and needed his space, I didn‚Äôt need labels from him and while I wasn‚Äôt forcing ‚Äòcommitment‚Äô with me, I wanted him to understand I didn‚Äôt need labels but I do need security and stability which he wasn‚Äôt providing.

He broke it off with after that conversation because he couldn‚Äôt commit. He tells me he likes me a lot but I don‚Äôt know how much of it is he just doesn‚Äôt like me enough or if he‚Äôs actually going through something like he keeps telling me but is pushing me away to avoid dealing with it.

He wants to remain friends and that we could revisit in a few months when he sorts himself out. I was visibly upset, I thought it was cruel considering he has apologised for his behaviour in the past saying ‚Äò(I) am a complete d\*\*\*head, I would be a damn fool to not chase after you.‚Äô

In spite of all this I am concerned for him and really wanted to help but I don‚Äôt know what else I can do. I‚Äôm also a bit heartbroken because even after all this, a part of me is still trying to look for solutions. I don‚Äôt want him to punish himself over this.

isfp,"This will be so ENFP of me, but I have been trying to type my crush for about six months and I'm quite unable to - mostly because he's two different people onstage and offstage.

Before anything else - he is not necessarily a celebrity, most people don't know him by name and we know each other.

Some starting points that contradict one another

- He's an incredible performer, a show-off.

- He's a multinstrumentalist. Can play basically anything.

- He's a great singer.

- He's a pretty straightforward lyricist - all stuff love-related, simple, if not shallow. Naive-ish.

- He's very physical towards me, the first man I didn't hit when he touched me randomly. Hugs me tightly, kisses me.

- He is not necessarily physical with most other people.

- He is not a drug user, rarely ever drinks a full can or bottle of beer and I saw him smoke two cigarettes in an occasion where he was super-nervous.

- He is quite a dresser. Like, I don't know that much about clothes and shoes and I'm a woman.

- He's very cerebral - has two university degrees in seemingly unrelated fields. HOWEVER, one of those two was what his parents wanted from him, his mother's profession.

- He's been quite persistent about one of his projects, which people pretty much discredited at first.

- He's approachable and kind to everybody, but he never posted anything personal on Facebook, rarely ever reveals something that's not professional. I was surprised when I went to see if he was okay after a show where he had voice problems and he revealed that he needs a vacation and is taking a random one, in a quiet village.

- When we reunited after a long time I spent thinking he did something he never did (his friend insulted me, not him...), he was somewhat guarded before I apologised, but even then he was nice. The moment I said I was sorry, I could literally feel his guard drop.

- He has long-term future plans. I, err, have none.

- He has an adopted child, which is a very, very rare thing here.

- He talks a lot and knows a lot about many things - both music-wise and otherwise. His vocabulary is great.

- He doesn't force his opinion on people

- His expressions often don't match what he's doing or saying - e.g. he'd be happy to see me and have a resting bitch face. He'd suddenly go all awkward during a live show while somebody else is talking and look down, giggling.

- In all groups of people, the one who dominates the conversation and talks most.

- Sometimes he has these power trips going on and it comes across when he assures people that everybody in the band is an equal and then talks about how he wanted to have creative control over everything.

- There is literally no dirt about him - another reason I'm surprised so as to why he is seemingly returning my affections. That makes me wonder where his Fi is.

- Huge eater. Doesn't really have a refined taste.

- A hard worker, dedicated. Has family, currently the only breadwinner.

- For those who believe this is related: stocky build, round face, large eyes, weight going up and down, but nothing that could be seen as thin or overweight at any point. High kinesthetic intelligence, ambidextrous. Delicate and gentle mannerisms when not in-character and/or onstage.

I've always kind of struggled in school... I get decent grades, but nothing exceptional enough to get into a really good school (3.2 unweighted, 3.5 weighted). School has always been difficult because, though I am fairly intelligent, I CANNOT stay focused and am unbelievably disorganized/constantly turn stuff in late. I'm not sure that a career requiring a Masters is very realistic for me.

isfp,"So, I have an ISFP personality type, obviously. I was wondering if anyone else here has had to cope with social anxiety and/or depression. It's really frustrating, I'm already quite shy, and I want to make friends and hang out, but I'm too damn scared to talk to people. No one ever initiates conversation with me. I consider myself quite approachable. I don't look at my phone much when walking around or sitting down, I almost never have headphones in, I keep my head up, I smile a bit, I don't cross my arms. It's even harder to talk to people when they're always looking at their phones or computers, listening to music, are talking to someone else, or have a very unfriendly look on their face. I also suck at talking to people when they're in a group(that shit's intimidating). I feel like I need some sort of ""excuse"" to talk to people, or they'll think I'm weird for talking to them for no reason. I have some valid excuses for talking to some people, like I've been trying to work up the courage to ask this girl if she wants to study together, but she's always with her friends and like I said, that's pretty intimidating to me. Yeah she's pretty cute, but I'm trying to make friends, and I think this would be a pretty good opportunity. I'm fairly certain she'll say no, because she asked if I wanted to study with her one weekend, and I obviously said yes. She said she wasn't sure when, so I said she could come by any time( we live on the same floor). Well surprise surprise she never stopped by, which I find rather odd because she asked me, but whatever,  there's a reason I don't set my expectations very high. And I did really well on the test anyways. I'm not mad at her. Like it is what it is, I just find it kind of strange. That's besides the point, and I have another excuse which is pretty strong but i feel like she'd see right through it. 

I know people my age get annoyed when older people say phones make people anti social, but damn, they definitely aren't wrong. I guess the phone thing was a culture shock because phones weren't allowed during the school day, and what do you know, people talked to each other.  But anyways I've gone way off topic (did I mention I have ADD?)  but how should I, a shy, introverted, socially anxious, weird, first year college student make friends when no one is open to conversation? 

Also not helping my situation is the fact that I am currently without a roommate.

TL;DR- How should a weird, shy, introverted, socially anxious first year college student(18m btw) make friends when no one wants to talk?",1539483305
isfp,"I have no friends, so a majority of the talking I do is with relatives. My talks with them is always the same old same old. With my older sister, it's at least a little more interesting, still not that interesting though. I really miss my little brother. Too bad we don't live together. I miss playing video games with him. 

I guess I prefer action over talking. I would consider myself to be an intellectual, but as I've gotten older, the satisfaction that I get from conversing has faded away. 

I have watched many YouTube videos and read a lot of things online. Whenever a family member talks to me, I have already heard those words, only spoken differently. 

I'm not saying that my relatives should only say things that I have never heard before, but it sure does get boring hearing the same stuff over and over. I am also not saying that I am smarter than anyone.

I guess this is what friends are for. They are more exciting than relatives. Unless you are lucky and have exciting relatives. I miss my best friend. I remember we used to talk about many different topics during lunch. Politics, religion, society, video games, Anime and some other stuff. I will admit, sometimes the conversations were a bit boring. It was because of me though.

I never have much to say. Usually I just nod my head and agree with the person. Adding in a few of my thoughts here and there. My best friend was an Atheist and I remember just agreeing with everything he said, despite believing in God. 
I'm scared to say things that will start disagreement or a debate. 

I know that a debate is not drama, but I don't like debates. I don't care about being right or wrong either. Debates are just boring. 

The conversations between my best friend and I kept changing over the years. We were changing. We began to talk less and less. We began to hangout less and less. The text messages were less frequent. When we would hangout, we wouldn't have much to say.

One time we went to the mall and I remember sitting down at one of the tables with him. He said that he used to be like me and would care about what other people thought about him. And that he is no longer like that. He doesn't give a f*** anymore. In a way, he was saying that I was kind of boring. 

After that day, everything changed. We started to hangout even less. I think our relationship was the strongest in the beginning years. He found out how boring I really am. I know he still cares about me and respects me. But who wants to hangout with someone that is boring?

I miss him a lot. He was my only friend. My best friend. At first, I hid my emotions. ""I'm actually not that sad that we grew apart."" ""I don't need him."" ""I can find new friends."" But it all started to hit me. I missed him. He could never be replaced.

Anyways, back to the talking is no longer fun. I remember having a chat with my sister's boyfriend this one time. I was just listening to him speak without really adding much to the conversation. I even said, ""sorry I don't have much to say."" He said not to be sorry.

I prefer to do activities with someone, like playing basketball rather than having a long conversation with them. Of course we can still chat while playing basketball, but we aren't sitting down having a **long** chat that can become boring.

Is this an ISFP thing to not really enjoy conversations? Or am I just socially awkward? I'm probably just socially awkward.

However, it involved making a life-changing relationship decision together, which Dear Hubby (DH) later came to regret/resent me for, and then used as a long-term justification for cheating on me. That infidelity stopped about 12 months ago, but for DH the pain and guilt hasn't passed. For the most part, DH carries this all as a silent pain, but I feel a lot of empathy for him, and quietly carry the pain alongside him. He struggles to discuss it with his therapist, even though he actively wants to work on it with them.

Looking back, he can see better decisions he could have made to be less hurtful to the people he loves. While I think he could have made better choices, I've forgiven him for what he did. There is still a solid friendship between us, including moments of deep love and a sense of respect. If I have a frustration, it is only that this moral wound holds him back from rebuilding with me. If I have a fear, it is that DH will officially decide he isn't worthy of his own forgiveness. I'm not sure what he'll become, if that's the case...

This survey is entirely anonymous. Please answer as honestly as possible, even if you don't like your answers.

[CLICK HERE FOR SURVEY](https://goo.gl/forms/jbXVEyrSwhedbK3C3)

I'm really interested in Brene Brown's work on shame, vulnerability and wholeheartedness. I've noticed that, while MBTI focuses on highlighting our strengths, the discussions in many MBTI communities seem to focus on the struggle to overcome flaws or struggles with vulnerability. It seems that we're all drawn here to tinker around inside our behaviors, understand something important about ourselves, or understand the way we interact with the world. I'm wondering (informally, this is just for fun) if there's a pattern to MBTI personality types, and ease of wholeheartedness/living with courage.

So, I made this quick survey. Enjoy!(?)

She's also a close friend of mine, and we go way back, buttttt our friendship can go from perfectly healthy to strained in a matter of minutes.

My current thinking is that I need to stop trying to make her happy and just *listen* to her feelings (Fi) without trying to change them.  I also need to give her space at times, instead of trying to aggressively build rapport (which I'm prone to doing with those in my inner circle of friends).

I can‚Äôt ‚Äúpretend‚Äù to like people I don‚Äôt, or keep a dead relationship on life support just because it used to (or could potentially) be special to me.

Best case scenario I get bored or offended and cut ties, but often enough I‚Äôm expected to keep up appearances or spare someone‚Äôs feelings and continue to force things.

Examples are close friends who move away but want to maintain friendship, exes who offended you but still want to be relevant in your life, people you hate but know through work or mutual friends and are expected to be nice to, people who refuse to open up about themselves but seem interested in knowing your business, etc.

My straight-forward extroverted thinking gets increasingly annoyed when pushed because my stupid introverted feeling is concerned with being kind or socially acceptable and stifles my real thoughts.

isfp,"So, about an hour ago or so, my boss at my internship (ESTP) flipped out at me in a really nasty passive-aggressive way for browsing reddit (which is odd, since he never minds it, and I've been working all day) at the last 5 minutes of the day. This kind of behavior kinda scares me at first, but once it's over I'm the one who gers angry. 

So, that got me thinking, everyone seems to have certain habits when they are angry. My boss calmly, but in a really serious tone basically asks you ""what are you doing?"" and then once you give him an answer he pretty much verbally tears you apart in a passive-aggressive way, and tells you to continue your work. In my case, I am usually in some sort of shock at first, I get shaky and I'm some sort of scared, and after that I get really grumpy and start having thoughts in which I'm beating up the one I'm angry at, or think of ways to get revenge. I also pretty much completely ignore them when they say something, unless it's important, in which case I just reply curt and professionally.

Considerations:

I identify myself as a HSP and tend to avoid external stimulus; I wonder if that could have  stunted the growth of my underdeveloped Se. 

I could be a very unhealthy ISFP looping in Fi-Ni for some time and appearing like my intuitive counterpart (I go through several existential crisis/angst due to my high tendency towards self-(re)examination, gets extremely disappointed/depressed my ideals that do not fit into reality, haunted by my past and hopeless of the future in general) 

I am in my late twenties and should be at the stage in which my tert. function is developing and seeking out Ni stuff. Again, this could be me mistaking for as an intuitive: 

I am an enneagram 4w5 (or so I think). Maybe being having type 5 traits could influence my MBTI type and may explain why I often gravitate towards the cerebral (or lack of better word) stuff. 

I feel more of an intuitive with most sensors but more of a sensor with intuitives if that makes any sense.

I get the gist of their concepts, but it is incredible fuzzy (takes extra mental work) and can be difficult to grasp without having them break it down for me in a way that I can understand. 

My ego is insecure and wants the label of the INFP to join the kool club of the intuitives. Just throwing it out there.

Relationships; 

Naturally, I feel most at home with introverts due to our similarity but tend to gravitate towards extroverts for the novelty when meeting new people. I try to treat everyone with the same respect and see them as an individual, and just share a small part of my real self with them. I conceal my personality traits due to my social anxiety, and try to blend in as much as I can. Only the people that I have established a real connection gets to see all sides to my personality and beyond.

I tend to get along very well with feelers. The healthy feelers with higher empathy are the bee knees! I noticed how we feelers (probably unconsciously) would often get super consideration of each other emotions/how we feel, and attentive to how we are feeling, which is like a double edge sword. I really like matured Fe-users; I feel like they are more emotionally open/expressive than I could ever be, which I find very attractive as a high Fi user. 

Being a heavy feeler, I usually clash with thinkers, depending on their emotional maturity and how forgiving they are with my inferior Te. They could help balance/ground my emotions and offer me rationality. I noticed that I am more verbally aggressive with thinkers, as much as they imitate me. I enjoy the freedom to be as blunt/direct as I like with thinkers and know that I won‚Äôt completely scare them off/ won‚Äôt take it as a personal attack (with feelers, I have to a bit more tactful). There seems to be a magnetic attraction towards the TJs. 

In theory, I am drawn to ENFPs for ideal friendships (don‚Äôt think I have met any irl yet, but I feel/imagine we could click right away and be some sort of partners in crime dynamic-duo thing with lots of nonsensicalness/inside jokes/memes). ENXJs would probably be my ideal mate.  

-

Disclaimer: I am not very familiar with all the functions and just putting things that associate my understanding of what I think the each of the function means...

Se; 

I have an okay awareness of my immediate surroundings; know what‚Äôs going on given from the overall feel/vibe of the environment.  

I like to point out almost everything I notice in my surroundings like in a very child-like way. I am the most carefree and emotionally expressive when I am in the present moment.  

I always feel like dancing or twirling around when I am in listening to music. 

I think I do not prioritize my Se very much and have no real interest in chasing after sensory stimulation/experiences. Maybe because my Fi kind of devalues Se. Sometimes I want to experience new things but I don‚Äôt really care about missing out on experiences all that much. I am a bit of an extreme introvert and stay indoors for lengthy period of time and I never ""do"" anything, but I really like the idea of doing things. My friend had called me out on this: I am 'all talk' because I don‚Äôt follow through.

I do fall into my bouts of self-indulgence due to impulsiveness/excitability (when my emotions are in a ‚Äòmania mode‚Äô), but I notice it is as mean of escapism rather than a life satisfactory/fulfillment. 


Si;

Honestly, I do not have a full understanding of what Si is and taking a wild guess on this one...

I have the worst memory and cannot recall the details at all, seriously. I cant remember sequences of numbers and letter order of the acronyms. I completely mix up the order word of sentences and totally off with quoting famous people.

I very often tend to overlook details and hard facts a lot. But when I am planning/studying, I get super nitpicky with the minor details and write out a step-by-step guide. This is how I try to be more organized internally.

I went through phases of obsession with various historic eras and romanticized how it would be like living in that period. I invented my own fantasy friends instead of going out there in the real world and make real friends. 

I can be extremely nostalgic and sentimental. Very prone up bring up things/stories of the past from the present. Call talk lengthy hours on everything related to my childhood.


Ne; 

I am absolutely terrible considering the possibilities/not good at seeing situations from all angles. I usually draw a completely blank when I have to provide examples of something, specially to elaborate my point; absolutely terrible with explaining things. So terrible that I am very convinced that I have a legit learning/linguistic disability. 

But I can see the other side of an argument and tend to debate against it, just for the mental exploration/speculation. 

I really enjoy word play/puns (cannot say I very witty though--I make up my own logic and get a laugh at how illogical it is). I tend to be easily amused of the mundane of daily life. I make these vague connection to things that seems like it may have a double meaning. Sometimes I read too much into things when there is none. I make a lot of assumptions and projection. 

I enjoy novelty a lot and like to change up on things. I cannot stick to a consistent routine and pretty flexible when plans changes. But I dislike surprises. 

Not sure if I go off into tangents. Maybe I do but not very aware of it if I do because it feels like I my conversations/discussions are pretty linear because I these connections of the original thought if that makes any sense. I often catch myself when being very preachy and do that a lot (the latter). 

I say a lot of random nonsensical things to see how much bullshit I can get away with, and to provoke for a reaction from people in a non-direct way (more playful than trolling, or maybe it‚Äôs considered light-hearted trolling if that‚Äôs a thing). I find it amusing to deliberately confuse/mislead people with my paradoxical word play and such. I like to do this with my Ne-Ti/Ti-Ne users friends because they don‚Äôt take it all too seriously and we can play off our humor/goofiness...until they decide it‚Äôs becoming too much of a jester fest and they go full-on/cut me off with their Ti.

Ni; 

I am drawn to the curiosities and oddities of life. I also am very interested in philosophy, psychology and spirituality. Can get very randomly obsessed with the whys, and discovering the 'truths' of the universe. When I find a topic of interest, I can get addicted to hoarding information because my mind is weird and wants to take these side-projects of solving some on missing link to whatever theory I had in the moment that probably was just me falling out of reality and descending into some sort of madness as an coping mechanism of some sort. probably. I get into these long-winded rambles/rants and try to make things into some sort of philosophical discussions. 

Probably just human; I dislike having to do small talk with a passion. I get very drained having to talk about and listen to people talk in details/hard facts and the superficial. I bear with it out of politeness but to be honest, I am either daydreaming or timing for my escape to opt out of the conversation.

 So, thoughts?

isfp,"I know that it's my fault that my life sucks. I have nobody to blame. Yet I don't do anything to change my situation. I have no motivation to change, but I have to if I want my life to improve. 

I wish it wasn't so hard. People say going through tough times makes you stronger. I don't care about being strong. Nobody needs me to be strong. Nobody needs me.

What were these 20 years for? School felt like a huge waste of time and I hated it. Yet I waste my days away watching YouTube and browsing the net. I'm a walking paradox and everything I do and say contradicts myself.

I have no strengths or skills. And I don't have the energy or motivation to learn any skills or develop strengths. I guess my strength is being depressed. And anxious. And pathetic.

Why did it have to be me. There were literally millions of other sperm that could have made it to the egg instead. But it had to be me. Does everything happen for a reason? Was I meant to be born? Or did I just happen. 

I guess it's a good thing that this world runs on money. Maybe I will just become a workaholic. It will give me a reason to live, a purpose. After all, it pays for the food and bills. And you know that food and having a roof over your head is important.

Why am I writing this as a post on the ISFP subreddit page? I dunno. Maybe to see if any other fellow ISFPs can relate. Or maybe to garner attention because nobody cares about me and it feels good to get attention from strangers online.

Life blows. Mine, at least. Even if I did have ""everything"" I would most likely still have the same view on life. The only thing being different is less worries and stress.

Am I depressed? Or did I just take the red pill? Being able to see the ugly side of society and people. I know there is a lot of good in this world, and I should focus on it, but I don't. Why? I dunno. 

I don't know if heaven or hell exists. Or God. They say a higher power has to exist because the planets, universe and everything is so complex. It couldn't have happened randomly. Everything had to be perfect in order for the planets and universe to form.

What is stopping me from ending it all? The fear of death? The possibility of ending up in hell? The possibility of being born again with no past memories, and having to do it all over again?

I'm running out of ways to distract myself. If only the end could come sooner. 80 more years left. Woohoo for pity parties! 

I guess I should appreciate and enjoy mother nature, take care of my health and meditate. What else is there really? I kind of understand where monks are coming from now. Health, appreciating nature and being in the present moment are the true meanings in life. For me, at least.

Cool, I found my reason for living after throwing a pity party! A great success. Now it's time to be prepared to be alone for the entirety of this lifetime. Because people suck. I suck. Because I'm self-centered. Because I'm negative. Because I have a bad mentality.

This is not normal territory for me. I‚Äôve really only dated other intuitives and extroverts and I usually crave my independence.

But with this ISFP it‚Äôs like I never want him to go home. He makes being together just so...simple and sweet. Wether that be from the unexpected (yet super tender) moments of physical affection, his willingness to listen to me gab on about everything, his unique perspectives, or his playful humor.

I feel totally at ease with him - even in silence. It‚Äôs super relaxing not to have to fill with chatter/questions (a bad habit of mine).

He‚Äôs kind, intelligent, laid back, and a dozen other great things.

Now I‚Äôve been into MBTI for awhile, but ISFP was never a type I considered or thought about as a romantic partner. It‚Äôs one of the types I know the least about actually.

&gt;!I‚Äôve always thought I was an ESFP but someone told me that I display more Fi than Se, which would make me an ISFP. In the mbti letters, ESFP makes perfect sense and I can‚Äôt really imagine being something else, but when the functions get involved I apparently have more Fi.!&lt;

So I‚Äôm going to try to give points that support both sides and I‚Äôd like to hear your opinions.

**ISFP:**

‚Ä¢ I always score the highest in Fi on tests, which aren‚Äôt really designed to show you your lower functions, just your first one, and they mostly point to Fi.

‚Ä¢ I can‚Äôt imagine being a se dom because extraverted sensing is portrayed in such a yOLO IDGAF sporty way everywhere. Se in ESFPs vs ISFPs are described so differently:

&gt; Dominant Se is what gives ESFPs that need for sensory experiences. [...] It‚Äôs what would drive them to be the life of the party, as indeed some are.

&gt; Auxiliary Function: Se - The next function in the stack is Extroverted Sensing (Se). ISFPs will tend to appear casual and laid back, as most Extroverted Perceivers do.

[Source](http://www.practicalmbti.com)

I definitely relate more to the open ‚Äúgo-with-the-flow‚Äù whatever approach to life in the ISFP description more than the ‚ÄúI need external stimulation 24/7 and can‚Äôt sit still‚Äù ESFP description.  

‚Ä¢ I do care a lot about my identity (which is why I‚Äôm even into MBTI in the first place haha), and if someone screws one of my values, depending on how important it is for me I‚Äôll stand up for it and stay true to it until the end. If it‚Äôs some piddly thing, I‚Äôm more likely to avoid the conflict because it‚Äôs not worth losing a friendship over, but if they are trying to force me into changing my views I will not budge no matter how much trouble it gets me into.

**ESFP:** 

‚Ä¢ I do relate to the inferior Ni tendencies like not thinking before I say/do stuff and it affects my social life too. Also feeling like my future is screwed over forever when I‚Äôm under stress and I noticed that I feel like it‚Äôs going to go in one specific path and then end up hopeless in the end. 

‚Ä¢ I definitely love social gatherings and chances to hang out with people. I do have social anxiety in certain situations but I tend to do better with people who are older than me. As a child I always jumped into conversations and pictures and my family never would have called me quiet and reserved. Although I don‚Äôt mind my time alone, I never turn down an invitation or cancel a plan just to stay home.

‚Ä¢ I never really cared to stand out by dying my hair or wearing excessive jewelry or wearing obscene clothing. I stick to a normal clothing style and just want to live my life day by day. I try not to overthink stuff and I try to ask for as little as possible. Wake up, do whatever‚Äôs necessary, and if something exciting comes up like an invitation I‚Äôll go.

isfp,"17 year-old male

I get tired of people very very fast.

I hate talking for the sake of talking.

I'm very private about my interests.

I hate fake people.

I love music. I probably listen to 5 hours of it a day. I listen to music more for the melody but I find the lyrical aspect more interesting. I mostly listen to stuff that I feel I can relate to. I'm constantly listening to albums I haven't heard yet and there's stuff I love in every genre. My favorite band's Pink Floyd.

I love video games but I play them more to appreciate them than to enjoy them if that makes sense. Graphics aren't really something I care about, almost all the games I play are from past generations.

My heart definitely controls my head. I got severely, severely depressed for almost a year over girl I never even kissed because she liked me for a tiny bit and I didn't feel disconnected from everyone else for the first time. Love's probably what I think about the most.

Making friends is incredibly hard for me. I'm still scared of people because I was severely bullied as a kid. Only friends I still have are from elementary school when making friends was incredibly easy.

I'm not interested in shallow friendships. I have four friends but I have a very deep connection with all of them. I had a traumatic childhood and so did all of my friends and I feel like they're the only people who've accepted me.

I'll sometimes become extremely reclusive. I'll stay in my bedroom with the light off and not talk to anyone for a week. I often forget to talk to my friends for weeks but they're always happy to hear from me.

I've never left the west coast in my life but I have a strong desire to see the world.

I'm intelligent but depression and laziness has caused me to have absolutely horrible grades. In 4th and 5th grade I received 100% on the really fucking long state tests in math. I was the only person to do it both times. I get straight F's though (sorry if I sound like a dickhead here, I'm not trying to brag by anonymously telling strangers I'm smart, I just think it could be relevant).

I both dislike and love almost everyone. There's people who I'll think are really cool, but I'd want to hang out with almost none of them (if that makes sense).

People think I'm pretty funny, but I have an unusual sense of humor. All my jokes are really just thoughts I have, I don't really know how to explain it. I'd never try to put someone down with a joke.

I don't do anything that I don't want to do.

All of my morals are based on my own values.

isfp,"Hello everyone ^^

As an ENFP, I got this strong need to share my thoughts and feelings so... here am I!

Anyway, I've been in a loving relationship with this sweet, gentle, caring male ISFP for like 5 months and everything is actually going great and very fast (I've met his friends and family, we've spent 2 wonderful weeks together at the sea, he has met my parents, ...). Btw I'm 20 and he's 2 years older.

Everything is perfect... except in my head. I have this constant feeling of ""we're not meant for each other"". Like we have needs we can't fulfill. Well, here are all my thoughts:

I feel like I'm all useless... when he's happy, it's okay but when he's down (oftenly), I feel like I can do nothing for him. If I'm useless in his worst moments, what's the point?? Yesterday, he was all sad and he only said stuffs like ""can't wait to see my bff tonight"" or ""I feel so lonely"" (even though I was hugging him). I try to understand him, I try to do many things to cheer him up (many acts of service, hugs and kisses, words of affirmation, making him laugh a bit; I even asked him to punch me if it can make him feel better xD)
But he'll only feel bad and will say ""don't bother yourself for me"". He doesn't understand that it is not bothering me... I try to listen to him but he has hard time to open up and share his feelings with words (typical ISFP). 

I know that I'm trying too hard and it's not my role to be his ""savior"" but still... we're supposed to be partners, a duo, and being with our SO should make us feel better...

I feel like he's with me because he's afraid that he couldn't get better, that he likes me a lot (lots of affection) but it's not ""love"". When he says that he loves me, it feels untrue. I feel like he needs to be understood but I can't understand him because we're so different. That there is not this ""connection"" (or is it just me as an ENFP?).

It's killing me. I want to cry all the time and even want to throw up while eating. I don't know what to do. I thought of breaking up many times because I don't see the point of this relationship (a bit idealistic but if we're not meant for each other, why should we stay together?). At the same time, I want to stay for his sake because it's a difficult time in his life (school being very stressing) and... I love him ^^

I know that MBTI doesn't resolve everything and that we are all unique but I'm in despair. I've already talked to him but it hasn't changed anything.

So i decide to look through the description to see if there's any reason why it's different, besides the fact that my Judging and Perceiving has always been very balanced. There was one thing that resonated with me so much I knew I had to be an ISFJ.

""*Given how generous Defenders are with their warm praise and support, it‚Äôs not surprising that others enjoy their company enough to call them friends. The challenge is to be considered a friend back ‚Äì people with the Defender personality type are shy and a little protective of themselves, but they also need to be able to connect on a deeper emotional level. It makes sense then that most of Defenders‚Äô friends are made not by random encounters on a wild night out, but through comfortable and consistent contact, as in class or in the workplace where they have the time to get to know each other little by little.*""

The person who I'd consider my closest friend, we only met a year ago, and it was by talking to each other consistently in class everyday our friendship grew. I think after reading this I was mistyped for a while. 

As for how my results came out this time:

- Introverted: 97%

- Observant: 58%

- Feeling: 86%

- Judging: 54%

- Turbulent: 64%

isfp,"For me:

INTJ: Kinda like inverted ISFPs (Ni Te Fi Se vs Fi Se Ni Te). Generally speaking, great people which I tend to have the best conversations with. 

INTP: On a surface level, I can get along well with them, but a really deep friendship is a bit hard. Tend to be very hit or miss people in general, to me. 

INFJ: Like an ISFJ, but more relaxed and easier to have deep conversations with. I tend to mistype them for INTPs when get serious, though. 

INFP: Pretty cool people all around, but I sometimes get this feeling that they secretly dislike ISFPs for some reason. 

ISTJ: I don't have much experience with them, but from what I can tell they're basically more tough and less open minded INTJs. They usually mean well, though. 

ISTP: I get along with them really well. The only thing I tend to avoid around them is more feeling oriented topics, since alongside INTPs I consider them the least feeling type. Tend to be quite polite to me as well. 

ISFJ: Generally really nice people, but you don't want to make them mad, they're either Jesus 2 or Hitler. They have this weird ability to just disable their feelings altogether when they get serious. I can't say I understand their selfless attitude, though. Probably Fi vs Fe. 

ISFP: Kinda hard to say, actually. I just see this type as me. 

ENTJ: Less likeable INTJs (tert Fi vs inf Fi, I think), and more bossy (Ni dom vs Te dom).

ENTP: If every personality type was a candy, this one is crystal meth. To me, completely random and indecipherable. They're quite similar to a chimpanzee in some ways, at first they seem okay, and they may even appear to like you, but then after a few minutes they may just rip off your face for the lols. On paper you'd think they're basically extroverted INTPs, but they have this really vicious way of talking and toying with everything INTPs don't. I feel like they're wielding some sort of knife that only ISFPs can see, other types don't really mind them. 

ENFJ: Outside of the excessive ""you can do it! believe in yourself"" thing (let me be self-conscious!) they're great people.

ENFP: I call this one the glittery lesbian type, pretty cool people. 

ESTJ: I know very little about this type, but I once had this teacher who I guess was one. A pretty nasty person, extremely by the book and would punish you for about anything, with a big nasty smile.

ESTP: A of a weird version of the ISTP. Much more aggressive than ISTPs, they tend to be the stereotypical bully (that spends way too much time getting tanned). OR they're that cool friend who's always doing something reckless. Not a fan of ISFPs, as far as I can tell. 

ESFJ: Friendly, but something overbearing. 

ESFP: A weird version of the ISFP. On paper they seem like great people, but they're kinda like ESTPs to me. Can be really intimidating in groups, tend to be ridiculously loud and will shout profanity at you for no reason. OR they're like that ESTP friend, except a bit more pep talk-y and warm.",1536133434
isfp,&amp;#x200B;,1536114327
isfp,"As the title says I can‚Äôt  really determine my type. I have gone through my functions stack and I‚Äôll give you examples.

I know I am an introvert. Eventually people drain me and if I am around people for too long I get very cynical. I hope for the best in people but I often see the worst.

I am sure I use Se. When I am not working it is in a lazy way. I am very laidback and want to have a good time. When I am working (Electrical mechanic), I am very dedicated, I believe in doing quality work to the best of my ability. If I didn‚Äôt do any less than my best that would feel an awful lot like stealing. But off work I can be a couch potato probably because I‚Äôm tired and enjoy the break. I like poetry, books, history, psychology and mythology. Things that help me explore emotional depths and understand human behavior and thinking. I also enjoy art, music, and cinema.

As for Fi or Ti. Honestly this is where I struggle. I have strong morals. I am a traditional, hard working male who sees the value in traditions and not in a blind faith sort of way but I can also back up the traditions I value strongly with logic. But I will oppose traditions that don‚Äôt make sense. I have torn apart every major religion and found the flaws in them. This rocked my world as I was raised Christian. I refuse to do things that go against my morals. I strongly believe in honor, family, and protecting the weak. 

I want to go ahead and say that I respect whatever you believe but for me this is my story and what I have found to be true. As I got older and studied the Bible, I found many inconsistencies. This lead to a kick where I broke down every book and chapter and found every contradiction. Everything that didn‚Äôt line up. I also did this with the other major abrahamic religions. I actually studied Hebrew on my own. I basically witnessed the biblical story evolve from polytheism, to a henotheistic cult, to a temple cult, to a monotheistic cult, to a dualistic cult, and then to a messianic cult and finally to a Paulianic cult. All roads lead back to polytheism and psychological archetypes. Again, if you‚Äôre Christian, I mean no offense. I respect what you believe, I just couldn‚Äôt believe anymore after delving back so far. My current beliefs revolve around forces of nature, archetypes and being a good person. I just never understood how a culturally Western European person could find solace in an Abrahamic eastern religion. It clashed with my views of honor, family, and justice. 

I don‚Äôt know if the drive to understanding different religions was via Fi or Ti. Being Christian always felt wrong to me. But using history, comparative mythology, and psychology I came to peace and found my current gods which feels right. I don‚Äôt know if that was me using Fi and Te or Ti and Fe.

As for Ni. I can use that for work. I am a great troubleshooter. I can look at a circuit and pretty much take it apart and figure out how it works and I can visualize how wires are run but when it comes to planning for the future, I suck. I am organized, a minimalist, but I wouldn‚Äôt call myself someone who needs routine. I prefer improvising. But I see the value in making lists and delegating tasks because part of my job is seeing the big picture on projects.

I may have inferior Te or Fe.

I am prone to explosive fits of rage if someone tries to test me or treads over my beliefs. I am also protective and hate bullies.

I also feel the need to over organize and clean when I am stressed out which I hear can be a Te thing.

I am leaning towards ISFP based on my strong values and desire to be who I am supposed to be and not fit a mold. I am very rebellious. I get competitive. I am an Enneagram 8.  On the exterior I appear cold and calculated until you get to know me. Hard shell and soft interior for those I love. I am very private and never tell anyone my struggles or hardships. Only reason I am being open here is it‚Äôs reddit which is anonymous.

Things were going well until she flaked out on a date, and then sent me a follow-up text saying she's been needing to spend some time focusing on herself, but she still likes me and wants to see me again. I told her it's all good and to let me know when she wants to meet up. I honestly wasn't sure if she was letting me down easy, so I decided to leave the ball in her court, and leave it up to her to initiate another date.

I'd like to ask her out again, but I'm worried about scaring her away, or seeming inconsiderate if she's still wanting of alone time. Selfishly, I'd like to know where I stand with.

isfp,"Hi all ISFPs... 

A few days ago, my ISFP husband told me he wasn't happy in our marriage, and he wants to leave me. He's been very specific in communicating that he's not unhappy with me in particular, but instead seems to feel he's too broken/messed up for a healthy relationship. He's been a bit depressed lately, but things in our lives have generally been going well. For example, he recently got a raise at work, and we've been talking about having a baby soon. But, seemingly out of the blue, he's decided our marriage has to go... And that there's nothing I can do. He's expressed concern that I am not actually happy in the marriage, and he's expressed that he feels fear of hurting me. He's also said that he has unintentionally attached a lot of negative feelings (shame, anxiety) and childhood traumas to how he views me, and he feels like untangling them/removing those attachments is impossible. He says, ""I wish I felt like I had another solution."" 

There is still a lot of love. We're still very friendly with each other. We even talked a long time and held hands for a while this morning while we talked. We seem to be communicating very well about our feelings, it feels like a two way street. I definitely don't want him to go, and other than asserting that he wants to go, he doesn't really seem like he actually wants to go. 

I'm not really sure what to do. I'm trying to let him go, but I'm simultaneously communicating about ways in which it (a) isn't entirely his fault that these bad attachments exist, and (b) that it isn't impossible to untangle those attachments, although it will take time. We've been through about 6-7 hours of couple's therapy together, which has already seemed to do a lot in exposing these bad attachments. I really just want him to keep giving us a chance to do the healing work we need to do... So, I'm mindfully asking him to stay another few months, so we can keep sorting through the hard stuff. He hasn't said yes, but... He also hasn't said no. So, in the meantime, I'm still going to try to actively work on changing my side of the bad attachments. I'm going to work on giving him a lot more positive feedback, and I am going to try to cut out being overbearing or too idealistic.

**TL;DR Husband associates me with negative feelings/abuse, doesn't blame me, loves me a lot still, but wants to go anyways. I am asking him to stay another 2-3 months and keep giving therapy a chance to change our interactions.**

isfp,"Hey y'all,

After doing several tests I've gotten both ISTP and INTP as my type but after reading about both of them and being introduced to ISFP I'm still not sure which one I am. There's things about both types that describe me perfectly but there's also things about both types that aren't me at all.

**How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.**

I'm a 24 year old male, living in the Netherlands.
I've always been bad at describing myself but I'll do my best.

I'm very laidback, I don't ever stress about anything except when I'm dating someone and they randomly get distant and/or stop talking to me. When that happens I go into panic mode and go on a messaging spree which only makes it worse. Luckily this has gotten a bit better lately.

I spend most of my time in my room by myself, I love being alone.
While I do love being alone tho, I don't like it when there's no one to talk to online for a long time. I'm almost always talking to at least 1 person online unless I'm watching a tv series, playing a game or are otherwise occupied.

I'm on my pc 95% of the time I'm awake except during dinner or when I have to go to the store etc. 
Usually producing/listening to music (DnB), gaming, watching series or reading stuff on the internet.

There's nothing I'm very good at besides producing maybe (Altho calling myself very good at that would probably make me sound conceited).

I'm lazy, I don't have much energy, altho that's probably because I'm lazy cause all I do is sit on my ass all day.
I don't like sports, I don't like doing physical things unless it's something to do with nature, like climbing a mountain or hiking at a beautiful place.

I like going on adventures. I'd like to do some exciting stuff like skydiving (I'm afraid of heights but it still sounds fun to me for some reason), canyoning etc. Eventho it seems a bit scary.

I'm a quiet person, I prefer listening over talking. Even when I'm with close friends. Sometimes it's just because I don't know what to say, sometimes it's because the conversation doesn't interest me. 
With new people it's different. Most of the time it's because I don't like them, eventho I don't know them. Most people just aren't my kind of person. The rare times where I do like them, it's probably just me being shy.

When I was still in school, or when I'm walking around in the city among other people I don't know, I usually feel like I'm better than everyone else, they're all irrelevant to me. In my head I'm just like ""You'll never think at the same level as I do"" Sometimes I feel like ""a god among mortals"" so to speak. Eventho I know this is obviously not true.

I see myself as a kind person and until recently the happiness of the people I care about came before my own happiness. Thankfully this has changed cause it was turning me into a miserable sack of shit. I do still care about a select few people but not as much anymore.
It does take a lot for me to actually like a person tho. I don't like most people, which probably has to do with the fact that I feel like I'm better than them. The only people I do like are the ones I consider equals.

I don't have very strong emotions. Most of the time I'm just not really feeling anything. I am able to be happy,sad,angry etc but not very intensely. For example, a few months ago my grandma died and my reaction was ""oh"" 
Then again, if someone very close to me died it would probably be different.

I'm a different person online than I am IRL. Online I'm not afraid of conflict, I say what I think without caring if I offend anyone, I talk(type) a lot, I make the first move when it comes to girls (I'd never do that IRL)

Irl I'm quiet, try to avoid conflict, usually just hanging out in my own head. 

I suppose the online person is who I wish I was IRL.

I have a lot of tattoos and I'm far from being done. Most of my tattoos have no meaning and I just get them because I like them.

My mood can change pretty quickly and I have days where every stupid little thing pisses me off and I'll be in a shit mood for the rest of the day.

I don't drink but I do like drugs. Mostly psychedelics. No Coke, Heroin and shit like that. 

**Is there a medical diagnosis that impact your mental/comportamental stability somehow?**

Not that I know of. I did have a period of about 3 years where I was feeling down most of the time. No motivation, no energy, just sitting in my room, staring. This started happening after a break up with my fiance so that was probably the main reason. Nothing has ever been officially diagnosed tho.

**Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?**

Both my parents are Christian so I grew up with that. I went to church with them every sunday until I was about 14 I think. That's when I started developing my own beliefs. I'm an atheist now but I wouldn't say growing up in a Christian environment has had a negative or positive impact on me.

**What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?**

I don't have a job and I'm not interested in one either. I love the freedom of doing whatever I want whenever I want too much. I also don't like having a boss telling me what to do. If I'd ever get a job, I would probably start my own business.
I do produce music tho so I hope I can at least do something with that at some point altho sadly you can't really make a living off of music anymore nowadays.

**If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?**

That depends. I spend most of my time by myself and enjoy it. If it meant a whole weekend by myself without talking to people online tho, I would probably feel lonely after a while. 

**What is your relation with movement and your surroundings? For instance do you prefer a sport or outdoors event? If an outdoors event what is it? And why? If not what type of activities do you tend to engage in?**

Do music festivals count as outdoor events? If so, I love going to festivals. I only go to DnB festivals but when I'm there I always feel good. All the people there are just 1 big family who all come there for the same thing. 
I'm usually one of the people lying in the grass enjoying the weather and music rather than dancing in the crowd tho but a big reason for that is because my body feels 80 years old, not 24.

**How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?**

I'm honestly not sure. I don't think I'm very curious.
Most of the time I'm like ""It is what it is""
Sometimes when I'm reading, my eyes automatically go to the bottom of the page to see what it says there, does that count as curious?

**Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?**

Definitely not. I'm not the leader type. I don't like speaking in front of a group. I'd also be too afraid that if everything goes wrong, it'd be my fault. Then again, I do like the thought of people following me.

**Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?**

Not really. I never really plan things. If I wanna do something, I'll do it and see how it goes. Whatever happens happens. 
I do enjoy working with my hands from time to time, building things etc. But it's not a big part of my life and I rarely ever do it.


**Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.**

I'd say I'm pretty artistic. I'm a music producer so music is my main form of art. I've tried drawing as well because I've wanted to become a tattoo artist for a while but I've decided I'm just not good enough at it and I have no motivation to practice.
I'm too impatient. I want immediate results.


**What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?**

I used to live in the past. Now I just live from day to day really. I can't do anything about what happened in the past so why waste my time worrying about it. 
I also don't worry about the future too much cause I can die at any moment. I don't plan very far ahead except maybe a vacation or so, but that can change at any moment too.

*How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?*

Really depends on who's asking and if I can be bothered.
If it's something I don't feel like doing, I most likely won't do it, unless it's something that would save their life or so. 
I also won't help you if you always ask me for help but won't help me when I ask you.

**Do you need logical consistency in your life?**

I don't NEED it but I also don't like inconsistencies.

**How important is efficiency and productivity to you?**

Not very. I do everything at my own pace and in my own way. Sure there might be more efficient ways to do something but I'd rather do it my way. 

Productivity comes in bursts for me. Sometimes when I'm working on a new tune, I work on it for hours or days in a row. Sometimes I can't be bothered to do anything at all for days.


**Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?**

Sometimes, indirectly. I tend to try and convince people my way is the best way, not taking their feelings into consideration.

**What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?**

Music production. Because I'm good at it. Because I enjoy creating things I like. Because I get an ego boost when people tell me how much they like my music. Because I have a genuine love for the style of music I produce and I like being a part of that community.

Gaming because I like getting lost in a beautiful fantasy world and I enjoy good stories. 

Watching TV Series because I enjoy good stories and when I'm really into it I sometimes feel like I'm a part of it.

Carp fishing cause it's relaxing and it gives an adrenaline rush when the beeper(whatever they're called in English) starts beeping and you have to fight the fish for half an hour before it's finally out of the water.

Traveling because I love nature and discovering new beautiful places. I hope I've seen most countries by the time I'm old.


**What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?**

I never did well in school. It was just boring to me and I couldn't bother paying any attention to what we were learning. A big reason for that is probably also because I wasn't interested in what I was studying(IT).

So far the only thing that has really worked for me regarding learning things is just researching and reading stuff online.
I also think 1 on 1 sessions would work well for me but I've never tried it.


**How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?**

Not very. Most of the time I just go with it and see what happens. I don't like structure. I need to be able to do what I want, when I want. If I have a plan of what to do first, what to do next etc, it's not gonna help with my productivity because it really just depends on what I feel like doing at that moment. If I'm at ""step 2"" on the list and I don't really feel like doing that at the moment, I'm just gonna put it aside and do nothing.


**What's important to you and why?**

Feeling loved. Eventho I may seem like an insensitive asshole sometimes, deep down I still have the need to feel loved by the people I care about. (Yes, I'm one of those people that need reassurance that they're still loved when in a relationship) 

Being appreciated. If I go out of my way to do something for you and I don't get as much as a ""thank you"" I'll think twice before doing something for you again. 

Becoming successful with my music. It's the only thing I'm somewhat good at in my life and actually enjoy doing. 


**What are your aspirations?**

Again, becoming successful with my music. Becoming a well known artist in the DnB scene, playing at festivals and other indoor events. 
I don't need to become rich, but making a decent living off of it would be nice.


**What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?**

Fears: Losing my parents, falling to my death(heights), not being loved by anyone other than my parents.

Makes me uncomfortable: Talking in front of a crowd. Nothing else really.

Hate: Wasps, people trying to shove their beliefs down my throat, cheaters, rapists, pedophiles, men abusing women, stupid people, people who get offended easily, being stuck on a tune, starting a new tune that sounds sick and ends up sounding like shit. People asking me why I'm so quiet are telling me I should talk more. People telling me I should smile more.

**What do the ""highs"" in your life look like?**

Exploring a new country, taking in all the beautiful scenery.

Releasing a new EP/Album and getting a lot of good feedback from other producers who I look up to.

Starting a new tune and it's like one of those sketches where I'm like ""Oh shit, this one is gonna be sick""


**What do the ""lows"" in your life look like?**

Haven't really had any lows lately actually. Everything is going pretty smoothly at the moment.

Back in the day tho most of my lows had to do with girls. Breakups, rejection, stuff like that.

But now I'm just too laidback to really care about anything. Shit happens. What's worrying about it gonna do.

**How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?**

I daydream a lot. Half the time when I'm on the pc I'm just staring at the wall or the screen but not actually seeing. Just zoned out. Most of the time I'm not even thinking about anything. Just staring.
When I do think of stuff, it's usually me making up stupid scenarios where I have like some kind of superpower and I'm fighting a bunch of people. Stuff like that.

**Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?**

I was gonna say something else until I read ""What do you think about"" 

I'm not sure really, probably stupid scenarios like I said above. How to get out of the room. What am I doing here. Who put me here. What do they want. 

**How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?**

Really depends. Some decisions are easy to make no matter how important. Some are hard to make. 

**How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?**

I don't need time to process the little emotions I do have. Emotions aren't important to me as I've never known them very well. 

**Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?**

Only when they're so long-winded that I'm like ""Yeah whatever""
I usually agree sarcastically tho but most of the time they're too stupid to understand that it was sarcastic anyways.

**Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why would you?**

I only break rules that seem stupid to me. Or when I wanna be adventurous and go to places I'm not supposed to go, usually because they're dangerous.

**What is the ideal life, in your opinion?**

Having enough money to live comfortably, travel when I want to wherever I want to, never having to do anything I'd rather not. Half year spring half year summer. Making music that's being appreciated. A girlfriend/wife that has the same interests as I do and support me in my music. 


EDIT: Some more useful information

ISTP that's me:

- I like adventurous stuff. Canyoning, Wild water rafting etc.
- I can be very blunt and offend people without realising it or just not caring.
- I like posting things on Facebook sometimes that might ""trigger"" people because it's fun.
- I'm a good driver. Not as in following the rules perfectly but good at controlling my car. I usually drive quite a bit above the speed limit. I feel like I'd be good at Rally.
- I don't experience much emotion. 95% of the time I'm just neutral. I do have days where I get pissed off easily tho and when I am, I'm in a shit mood for the rest of the day.
- I live from day to day. I don't care about the past or the future.
- I like weapons. Swords, guns, you name it.

ISTP that's not me:

- I don't know much about cars and stuff like that. I do find it a bit interesting tho, but only a bit.
- I'm not athletic. I've been to the gym a few times, I've done sports like Ping pong and Badminton but that's about it. I do like watching football (soccer) tho.


ISFP that's me:

- I used to draw a lot
- I'm an artist (music producer)
- I love nature and beautiful things
- I like gambling.
- I can be pretty bad with criticism
- I can be very competitive




ISFP that's not me:

- I don't have a ""live and let live"" attitude. If I don't like you or don't like the things you do you can just die for all I care.
- I only easily relate to others when I choose to do so.
- I'm not easily stressed. I don't know the word ""stressed""
- I hate children



Something which I'm not proud of but might help:

A few years back I was dating someone(online, like all the people I've dated in the past few years) and she started becoming distant for no reason and after a while just stopped talking. Which made me go into panic mode, sending message after message and it didn't help (obviously). After a while I decided to tell her I have cancer just to make her talk to me. (Yes. I know it's fucked up and no I never told her the truth) Eventho I know it's fucked up tho, I don't feel regret or anything. It's just whatever.

Some other things which might or might not help:

I hate 90% of people. Even if I don't know them. If I don't like their face, I don't like them.
Everyone is just fucking stupid.

I always look like I'm about to kill you.

I like martial arts and would love to be good at fighting. I also like watching UFC and things like Ultimate Fighter. Especially when there's some sick knockouts. Don't care much about the matches where they're just hugging eachother for 3 rounds.

I make the worst puns. Puns are easy.
.
I can be extremely sarcastic.

I have a very dry sense of humor.

I definitely don't find things like Family Guy, Southpark etc funny. Can't stand them.

Things like hurricanes etc sound fun to me. Finally something exciting happening!

Being a vigilante sounds fun. 

Killing rapists, pedophiles, animal abusers etc would be cool to have as a job.

I'm very emotionally stable, if that's the right choice of words. For example, people always warn about bad trips when taking stuff like mushrooms etc but I just know that it's impossible to have a bad trip for me. I'm too care free for that. 

Some days I just fucking hate everyone and they should all just shut up and leave me alone until I don't hate them anymore.

I hate it when people beat around the bush. If you wanna say something, say it or shut up.

What is peer pressure?

What is planning?

I've been out on 2 dates, the second date we kissed after he asked me to ""shut him up"", and when saying goodbye.

Here is the thing, after the first date, it's been me initiating the plans. I asked him out a few days ago, to which he said no to due to family reasons (although, now I'm beginning to believe that was an excuse). I saw him on the day we were supposed to go out, and as always, he was being very (VERY) flirtatious. 

Today, I asked him out for coffee later on during this week, to which he replied ""I honestly am busy with work so I'll have to see what work is saying"".

I don't understand why he openly flirts with me in person, but when it comes to making an actual, solid plan, he seems to have an excuse (and basically rejects me). This is the third excuse he's come up with, and I've basically given up.

isfp,"Hi everyone! I‚Äôve done a lot of reading and there seems to be conflicting opinions about ISFP and ESFJ unions. I think ISFPs are adorable and fascinating but also really confusing so if you could spare some perspective, I could really use some backup (:

I (24F) have been seeing an ISFP (29M) for four months and it was great to begin with. His Fi fascinates me, the way he is absolutely sure of himself and won‚Äôt compromise who he is in anyway. I like how his eyes are so expressive and that he sees beauty in things I would never consider and it reminds me to stop and smell the flowers in my no nonsense practical approach to everything. 

He was extremely persistent to begin with and after I agreed to go on a date with him, we got on like fire. He was mentioning things like if I wanted children and marriage and even hinted at moving in together when I almost bought a house. He made sure early on that I was open to a relationship. I thought it was intense but I figured that‚Äôs just who he is and accepted it - I was never sure if he was joking or not. All of a sudden, he became distant for three weeks and nothing was defined beyond the fact that we were exclusive - to which there was no conversation, just that he expected me to not see anyone else because he wasn‚Äôt. 

I knew that ISFPs need space to ruminate and formulate their thoughts so I waited, even though it was excruciating. Eventually he came back but would pull away, especially when I showed affection. He eventually expressed he feels lost in his life, especially in his career and that it is reflected in his interactions with me even though he wanted to be with me. It became a problem when he mentioned that I could talk to (but not see) other guys if I wanted. I was confused and seeing he hurt my feelings, he then expressed he is not good at explaining his thoughts and he wishes he never said it - inferring from other threads, this is something ISFPs struggle with. 

I initially wanted to distance myself in fear of getting hurt and at the advice of my friends of him ‚Äòstringing me along,‚Äô and called him to voice my opinions early so he could have time to then think and get back to me. However in my vulnerability, I broke up with him thinking he needed his freedom and I couldn‚Äôt possibly wait indefinitely. 

I have since realised that I needed to break free of my Fe of letting other people‚Äôs opinions of me inhibit my decisions. I need to go after what I want because it is a real connection I feel and I would regret if I didn‚Äôt at least try. I am worried that I jumped the gun with the break up and that I have ruined my chance. 

I have presented to him my perspective that nobody is perfect and that relationships are a safe place to be who you are, insecurities and flaws laid bare for mutual growth. I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm being selfish but I care about him and want to help.

In the end, I don‚Äôt want to push him and force him into something he doesn‚Äôt want but am I being unreasonable? I know Fi values doing everything at their own pace and hope I‚Äôm not being ignorantly self righteous by playing saviour. 

Do ISFP/ESFJ relationships never end well? Is there something I can do about the Fi/Fe clash? I had a five year relationship with an INFP so I already have an idea of what it could be like. But I was young and stupid then and have tried to learn from that relationship because it was very fulfilling otherwise. I have been determined to grow from it to be a better person because let‚Äôs face it, I was probably that stereotypical ESFJ that everyone hates.

Will he resent me for trying help and see it as an impingement on his freedom for self discovery? What can I do? I am giving him space to make his decision now but it‚Äôs eating me up inside.

TL;DR    ISFP is hot and cold, I broke up with him out of fear but have since tried to reconcile by trying to work it out. I am trying to be understanding and respect his space but am worried I stuffed up big time. Help!",1534547314

I feel the same as i did when i was 20 pretty much. I dont know if this is a good thing or a bad thing. 

I went on a night walk with a friend just chatting recently and we passed through down town, stopping in to use the restroom at a bar. Everyone seemed so much older than me even though a lot of them were probably my age or younger. I guess its cus i dont really go out drinking so the bar scene is fairly foreign for me. But ive never felt more out of place and separated from them.  Im not immature (i think?) its not like i havent changed or grown since i was 19 or 20...

Instead of avoiding tasks I can't relate to, I should look at fortifying myself with activities which vitalize me. If I trust myself to live for my values, I will care less about doing the necessary minutiae. It's a form of self-respect.

I personally thought things went pretty well - flirting (a lot), getting to know each other etc. We know each other from work, and he had asked me out first. I declined politely the first few weeks, and after losing a bet on Saturday, we went out. 

Things got quite personal, he opened up about his family, background and some other things going on in his life. 

I saw him the next day, and we had a brief conversation, but nothing like the night before. I'm not sure why this was, and although I was recieving very positive signals the night before, I wasn't recieving the same next day.

isfp,"I'm sure this story is going to sound pretty intense/dysfunctional to many but I wonder if any of you have run away from a romantic situation.  I \[INFP, F, 30\] recently was in a fleeting love affair with a girl who is an ISFP \[F, 22\] with strong Ti (and yes, we're both big lesbians).  When I first met her, she was self-harming quite a bit, not sleeping, struggling intensely with anxiety, and drinking on a daily basis.  She was a bit hard to get to know at first, but would divulge small things about her life here and there - from the start, she was so kind and patient with me. That really stood out.

We began talking/texting daily, and we quickly took a strong liking to each other.  I did my best to support her emotionally and practically; we checked in daily about her SH/drinking. Pretty soon, she admitted to me that she  ""couldn't function without me"" and that she was infatuated with me. I admitted to her I felt like I was falling for her, too.

She rarely asked me questions about myself, but told me often how in love with me she was. She'd often muse about how nice it would be to run off together, elope, and how she'd love to have my children. Even though these were intense words, I fell into the fantasy with her and reciprocated.  Sometimes she'd disappear for days at a time without warning and then re-appear feeling really bad about it. One day, I asked her a question related to her paranoia and frightened, she disappeared for about 4 days. I was worried sick over her, and then I received an email from her apologizing profusely, stating that she ""ran like a coward"" because she was scared of answering my question, that she'd always love me, and that I was the most special person she'd ever met. Then I never heard from her ever again. 

I have no illusions about the workability of this relationship and realize after some reflection that it was likely doomed to fail from the beginning. I've read that ISFP's hate pressure, are flighty. I guess this might be a generalization, but have any of you run away from romantic affairs and why? Have you ever been prone to making promises and castles in the sky when in love - knowing fully that you wouldn't be able to follow through? Is this type prone to ghosting when under pressure?

isfp,"I've always considered myself an ISTP and then started wondering about INFP. Then someone suggested ISFP, which is something I'd never considered before. I read some descriptions of it that described it as an eccentric, social artist which didn't sound right. But a lot of details and the threads in this subreddit ring true in a way that the other MBTI subreddits never did.

For instance, I feel like I live life like a first person game. I observe a lot but don't really reflect on things. That isn't to say that I don't think or feel things, but I do it almost subconsciously. And in fact I do feel intensively, but it takes me a while to parse my emotions. And sometimes when I'm feeling something very strongly, my mind feels like it's looking at from a distance, like I'm playing a game.

Other aspects that ring true are my high competitive streak, the way I rarely initiate contact even with my loved ones, I have a fairly good taste in fashion and enjoy looking good, and I am a well-regarded writer. I also love doing things for other people, and while I don't like parading the fact, I get easily upset if people don't recognize and appreciate my efforts. I am also sensitive to criticism though that is an aspect I am actively trying to mend.

Does this all sound like an isfp? I am conflicted because I hate socializing with people I'm not familiar with--in party settings. I hate small talk and the pressure of wanting these people to enjoy my company. However I love smaller intimate social settings with people I am familiar with.

isfp,"Now, recently she brought up the idea of coming over to my place to have a movie night. I was cool with it and randomly a few days ago text me and says she wants to have the movie night. So I agree and we meet at my house after work, then get booze. We get back to my place and have a long nice conversation and then go to my room to watch the movie we pick. We then both down the whole bottle of booze  in under two hours. After the movie I'm pretty sure I rolled over to her on the bed and kissed her (like maybe for 5-10 seconds a few pecks I don't think tongue). As soon as I realize I'm kissing her and jump up off the bed and say I'm sorry and lead her to another room to sleep. 

She goes to the other room and takes the covers with her. Not long after laying on my bed coverless (for a few minutes/two hours who knows) I go get her and tell her to come back to the bed with me. We get back in bed together and while keeping space between us (hammered but remorseful and half sleep) I kept telling her that I was sorry. She then responds by just saying my name (meaning she wants me to shut up) and says ""what are you sorry for?"". 

When we wake up I notice that she is in my hoodie and just some panties rolled over on me trying to tangle my legs and play footsie with me (at least that what it seemed like). Later we both wake up and do some talking for about an hour (not mentioning anything of the last night) and hugs me good bye and drives home (in my hoodie). 

Now we've been texting like normal for the last few days, but I think she has been avoiding seeing me so I can being back some stuff she left at my house (avoidance is a way she has dealt with stuff between us before). Also, I was suppose to accompany her to her first counseling appointment today. She actually wants me to just leave her stuff in my car during work so she can pick it up. 

She's the best friend I've had in a very long time and I don't want to lose it. I'm sure she doesn't either. 

We tell each other we love each other all the time and we've both talked about how much we mean to each other all the time. 

I'm aware of the consequences that can happen from this (loss of friendship, respect, avoidance, friendship worsening) . I just don't know how it'll go and I don't know what she could possibly be thinking. I'm prepared for anything and am not really worried about myself or my feelings as I have the tools to work through it. I'm more concerned with her feelings and how I could have affected her. She has had guy friends who try and get with her and I'm afraid that she thought she found someone different, but still got her trust betrayed. We give each other space all the time and are never in each other's business 24/7 so I don't mind that. I'm not in love with her or anything, so I'm not emotional over possibly being ""rejected"" just afraid that she thinks I might be in love with her. And really concerned with losing my best friend. 

On one end I think I've messed up and believe that she might possibly have lost respect for me (she thinks I have it all together and I'm somewhat of a mentor to her at this point). On the other end I think maybe she's just weirded out and just needs time to sort out things? Heck, maybe she doesn't remember? Maybe there's some things I did that I didn't remember? I don't know?

We both think we found the one for life genuinely and love each other (i know she does). Still, she does not want to move in with me nor can guarantee that she wants to so in the next few years, which is killing me, especially because i would move to different planets in order to be with her. On the other, not so romantic side, i don¬¥t want to waste these years until we move together just to find out it doesn¬¥t work out. I know you isfps don¬¥t handle life very strategically, but perceive the course more like a movie sometimes, and at some point i guess it would just feel right for her, and it would eventually happen. But i dont want that gamble, and i am afraid that despite her love at some point, even if we will move together, she might just feel like parting ways one day. I could never leave her anyway, though. Also, she says she is afraid of moving in together because it might ruin our relationship. I, on the other side, cant wait to  try it out and optimize living together.

I guess it is normal in that age to have commitment phobia and it will fade at some point, and i am just the oppositve in terms of planning and strategy. But perhaps i am missing something.

-One of my acquaintances told me that I seem emotionally closed-off and not bubbly, especially for someone in my line of work (I'm a receptionist). 
-I'm uncomfortable in a leadership role. I don't like being bossed around, so I avoid imposing myself on others
-I'd like to think that I have strong aesthetics. I receive a lot of compliments on my style choices
-Here's a conundrum: I love going to events involving loud music, dancing, and autosports. However, I would just wander around and do my own thing instead of socializing with strangers. I just don't feel the incentive to do so.

I personally just try to avoid difficult people as much as possible. Once an acquaintance decides to step on my Fi, I start ignoring them and being dismissive of them when they talk to me. If we have mutual friends, they'd have to be understanding of that. Though if a long time friend hurts my Fi, I'm open to a lot of chances and negotiations with them.

isfp,"I am sorry it is such a stereotypical post. But I guess I do wonder how you guys KNOW.

My story is a bit complicated although I'll try to make it short. I've been dating a guy for 6 months and I feel at times this is the first time in my life that I am truly in love. I love him for a lot of reasons, but I feel like it's weird that I would even have to list to myself. Yet I do. He is actually a very smart and tolerant person. I love him for some things he has said to me that have touched me. It started as a very very shaky relationship because he was rude a lot of times (and I am pretty sensitive), but I knew he had been heartbroken, so I fought for myself and to heal his heart. And we made a lot of progress. He is now extremely sweet at times, never rude again, except under stress. One month in, at some point we got drunk, and then I just told him I loved him. He said he felt like it at times. So far, he therefore has not told me he does love me, but he tells me he misses me, sends me a lot of cute things that I never thought I would receive. At first it gave me a lot of anxiety, now I feel like it is okay. Because I am actually unsure of myself too.  


I am scared I will hurt him the way he was hurt in the past (she gave up on him after two years even though everything seemed great between the two of them. It seems that she just fell out of love). But it gave him depression, he had to rebuild himself through politics and strong values in order to feel right about himself again (he is ESFP)

so WHY do I doubt all of this. Well first of all I jumped into this relationship a bit randomly at first because he felt kind of impatient about my answer. I was very attracted to him and still are, but I did not know about the connexion between the two of us. We have a lot of fun, but a lot of the time I feel pretty anxious, forcing myself into talking in order to keep the conversation going. I do have this giddy, intense feeling whenever I talk to him, but sometimes it feels like I try very very hard to be more than myself.

I do get interested in the things he loves, and sometimes I think his passions make him very cute. I also do things to make him happy, and I love seeing him happy. But I feel like I push myself into asking, into talking, a lot of times, because it feels like it is the right thing to do. Because it feels like it is the way he will love me. Actually, a lot of time, I feel like I exaggerate my feelings just to make him happy, just to make him feel loved, to hear him laugh about it.

He told me recently he wanted to go to Greece for one month with me next year, which is amazing, considering how much I love greek mythology and how much he loves Antiquity. He actually had this idea because I told him how fitting such a travel would be to us. It also means he does want to stay with me for a long time, and I guess it's nice. I also think it's the best way for us to know if we are compatible or not, by staying together for a long time. I am not planning on dropping this relationship, but I think I am not being honest, I am not being myself. And I don't know if it's because it won't work or is it because I can't try to show him who the real me is. I automatically push pressure on myself to be this nice and adorable girl, when clearly I am 200&amp;#37; more sarcastic and calmer than I show. I think my problem is also that I fear we won't be compatible even though I know he is just an incredible person.

Ok. I‚Äôve identified as ESFP for a long time now. But lately I‚Äôve been confusing with ISFP because quite honestly, I don‚Äôt: 

- ‚ÄúHurr durr manipulate and control the environment and people.‚Äù I would rather just go with the flow rather than ‚Äòpush my own agenda.‚Äô  Unless something is really super important to me, I‚Äôm not forcing anything.

- I don‚Äôt ever really take the ‚Äòlead.‚Äô I‚Äôd rather let someone else more confident do it. I really hate bossing people around.

- I don‚Äôt know if this is whether I‚Äôm shy or was actually an introvert this entire time but: I can‚Äôt bring myself to initiate conversations. I might be standing in line, or sitting next to someone on the bus, and as much as I would like to make a friend I‚Äôm just too pussy to actually say hi or talk to them. And it‚Äôs also very painful if I do somehow muster up the guts to say hi and they don‚Äôt even hear me. I just think: well damn I‚Äôd be less uncomfortable just keeping my face in my phone. Now if *they* start the conversation, that‚Äôs a different story. I‚Äôd be more than happy to talk with them for hours and hours. I don‚Äôt even mind small talk. But the point I‚Äôm trying to make here is *I can‚Äôt initiate a conversation for the life of me!*

- I‚Äôm rarely the ‚Äúlife of the party.‚Äù I don‚Äôt *mind* being the center of attention, but I‚Äôm not constantly trying to throw myself out there. If I speak up and everyone listens, omg cool! But I‚Äôm never trying to force myself in the spotlight 24/7. I kind of rely on someone else to get the group all fired up. If you put me in a dead, cold silent room with people who seem depressed or uninterested in conversation, I‚Äôm not going to be the typical ESFP that ‚Äúlights everything up with my presence‚Äù and makes things lively. Like I said, I sort of just go with it. I‚Äôd rather it be more fun but I‚Äôm not the kind of person who would cause that.

- One of my friends actually thought I was an introvert (reference to point 3) because I was acting shy when I first met her. I sat next to her because I sort of wanted to talk to her, but I couldn‚Äôt actually talk to her. She was actually surprised I was typed ESFP because of that. 

**Although**, I‚Äôve never questioned my love to be around people. Even though I don‚Äôt initiate conversations or rile everybody up, I still would never turn down a social gathering. I would sooo rather go to a dinner party with lots of people at a resteraunt than stay home and read a book. Just the thought of that makes me excited.

I relate to a ton of the ESFP traits but not every single one. I also relate to a few ISFP traits too, but I honestly just feel like ESFP is the best fit for me. 

So to conclude, it is still possible to be a shy ‚ÄúE‚Äù or an outgoing ‚ÄúI,‚Äù otherwise I wouldn‚Äôt know *what* to do. 

Thanks so much for taking the time to read this, I really hope this was helpful.

(if you wanna have the same thought, just check my profile xD) Like, don't get me wrong. This guy wished me the best and he *accurately saw Fi and Se in me*. BUT, I think I'm TJ who has tried to develop his Fi side. Another thing is, there are so many Fi things and thoughts that doesn't come particularly naturally to me. Like ""Be yourself"", ""Not wanna be boxed in"". FPs just have this knack of their emotions that I simply lack, they are good at not being obstrusive, not stepping over the line, being polite, acting perfect socially and let's face it, I'm the opposite of that in many cases (an area for further improvement, and I HAVE already improved there). Another thing that supports this is, well I am fan of artists who I'm pretty sure are Fi doms, and like, I admire them and like the messages in their songs, but nah I don't have those skill myself, neither am I creative. Like, what do I do next in order to find out my type? I think I might be the INTJ to be honest, he would argue I don't have good enough Ni, but I'm not sure I'm gonna buy that xD.

Like, let's look at my past. I was like pretty controlling in ways I feel like, always demanding to do certain things or no I'm not gonna do it. And I wasn't open to trying many things that had even a little bit of risk, I was picky eater, was slow to get in the lake when bathing, didn't go on rollercoasters. Later though, I've became way more of a risktaker, but I feel like that stuff comes WAY more naturally to ISFPs and I had to sorta ""forcedevelop"" my Se. While the ISFP would have been way more chill. I also used to be this guy that was pretty dutiful, didn't really obstruse the rules and get myself in trouble (well I still am). Later I've become way more questioning of many rules. Like, I think I didn't necessarily agree with all rules even back in the day, but I just followed them. Like, it's like I have a natural knack not to do overly stupid shit or things that get me in trouble IRL, while P tend to do drugs and whatever without all too much thought, while that's like something I'd never do, especially not in my earlier days. Back in the day I always listened to teachers, my parents (when it came to significant things, and oftentimes also insignificant things). The activities I used to do when I was younger, wasn't really much F I think (like, I didn't play with dollhouse and mom, dad, kids or that many things with characters, although I did play it with my sister, but yeah I think ISFPs would have been those people who played dollhouse and things like that) (like for example, it was more like, games and physical activities (which might suggest S, but I think the way in which the physical activites were, might not make Ni dom impossible, still, and Si dom seems pretty farfetched, one of my friends is ISTJ and yeah I just doubt I'm that man)).

Let's talk about friendships and relationships: So as mentioned above Fi doms have WAY MORE of a natural knack at you know, behaving great morally and socially. Even though I do tend to be pretty sensitive in a way, IRL at least, and not just tell anyone whatever rudeness. Like, in my earlier days, I used to hit my sister, it was really horrible, and I regret it very much, but I don't think that's something a Fi dom would have like ever done. In significant friendships where I rly care about the other person, and if I'd ever have a relationship, I can be like hardcore loyal, and wish the other person the best. I think it's more in a ITJ way than FP way. Like, sometimes I can try to tell the other person what to do, but it's always for their best you know, like I try not to be over intrusive, but it seems like I always have to tell my opinion about things and tell the way things should be.

I also heard ""you can see your tertiary function"" or something like that, in a DaveSuperPowers, and that makes sense, cause in a way I really, really value doing the right thing morally with my life, like one thing I've wanted to do is helping humanity, but I think I tend to listen way less to my feelings, and have way less developed feelings, than FPs, even more IFPs, as let's face it EFPs are pretty selfish, flighty and disloyal lol.

isfp,"Saw your sub and wanted to breath some life into it, anyways I'll start.

I'll keep it short and simple.

My type: ENTJ

Favorite type: intp, I don't know where to start, from my experience with the few that I know, they tend to keep to themselves but if you let someone with this type actually open up to you and connect, they can be some of the most hilarious or interesting type people to have a one on one conversation with at 2 am, like they will think up the craziest things, and I'll think up how to actually make those things happen. Plus they are walking libraries, my cousin is one and his favorite hobby is legit learning things, whatever it may be, but when it comes to social interactions they can be so awkward in the cutest ways, anyways I think they can hold some of the most interesting conversations, just wish they would put more into action.

Least favorite type: ISTJ, never really knew any on a personal level, I think I just naturally don't get along with them, but I've worked with a few and it just annoys me how by the books they can be, like if there's a way to do something better, if I put it into action and actually yield more efficient/better results, they will still completely be against it. Honestly I like most people and can't really think of much negative things to say, what I do like about them however, is how serious they can commit to their work or passions, even if we don't see eye to eye I can totally respect that.

isfp,"My ISFP friend [18M] broke up with his girlfriend [18F] 5 months ago, mainly due to religious differences. He was the one who confessed to her and was eventually broken up with, so he's obviously heartbroken.

He takes a lot of quiet time to think about life (emo) every night, which is understandable, but I'm not sure when this is too much. By that, I mean being sad too much of the time and it becoming psychologically unhealthy.

He gets reminded very easily by his ex, for example, we were talking about our idols/celebrities and he mentioned that his ex met a certain celebrity before, even though we weren't talking about this certain celebrity at all.
He also won't go to places where he and his ex had had memories together (understandable, but that's a lot of places).

Basically, she is still on his mind all the time. I've tried to give a little advice on some things that might help, but he tells me that they'll never work and he's gonna be stuck in this emotional state forever.

He's pretty self-aware that he's sad a lot and says jokes about it (like when I said ""tell me when you're sad"", he replied ""that's my secret, I'm always sad"") or saying things like ""being sad sucks"", ""life sucks"", etc. I think all these are pretty normal reactions to a break up, but at the same time, it's been 5 months and I'm wondering if that's a little too long to be majorly upset ALL the time.

We hang out sometimes, but mostly communicate through text. He's really a great friend overall and will listen to my rants any time. I'm just really worried for his wellbeing and I wish he has more hope to move forward in life.",1529375261

Upset, maybe?

Mostly it comes from me automatically assuming that he's thinking the worst about me if there's not that constant reassurance/word of affirmation. Even then, the effect those have doesn't last very long. I wonder if I just slip into a FiNi loop or something, where I come up with these unfounded hunches and automatically assume they're true. Like, if he doesn't say goodnight or doesn't respond with much enthusiasm (I guess, if I'm giving more than he's giving back) then it really messes with my head, and typically in person I keep my distance and stay reserved until I feel like he's earned my ""trust"" again. Which is so weird, I don't know.

Is this type of thinking in the early stages of a relationship normal?

isfp,"I don't know why I pussy out when I try to tell her this. We don't really spend time together, and I make her uncomfortable for some reason. I often bother ISFPs, but I don't know why. It's very difficult for me to see into their heads, and they get annoyed and uncomfortable around me. It seems like they feel I just don't ""get it"". I'm trying, but I don't know what they want. Their minds are the most unusual puzzles I've ever seen. It's like their minds are from another dimension. It's so strange.

I think it's important to note that growing up with out of touch, emotionally immature parents and a narc mom in culturally socially strange places is going to have a huge impact on the relationship dynamics of a family, especially when one of the brothers is egotistical, socially unintelligent, and emotionally unintelligent.

The locations operate socially and culturally like they're their own country where everyone is interested in some Netflix show, festival, or occurrence the rest of the country hasn't heard of..It's weird.

My sister seems to want to do her own thing most of the time and often has to deal with conflict from my mom, brother, father, and me.  She'll have people invade in on her space a lot. The problem is we'll need something from my mom, but she'll be around my sister, so we have no choice but to constantly come in the area she's in. Meanwhile, my sister has an unhealthy attachment to my mom.

She seems to have trouble reasoning in the same way INTPs have trouble getting their Ti and Ne to work together at a young age (inferior Te?).

How can I get the balls to tell my ISFP sister our mom is a narcissist? She won't watch or look at anything I try to show her, and I feel uncomfortable explaining it to her. For some reason, she makes me feel uncomfortable when she pays attention and listens to me. I think it has to do with our relationship and the way she pays attention to me. Those big eyes staring so attentively..*shivers* I'm not used to her behaving so calm, passively, and relaxed.",1529170116

The negative: Sometimes I have a hard time discerning I am doing efforts or if I am faking and understanding if my interest in people comes from a selfish sorta need or a genuine interest and love, I have thought at times to have figured out only to realize Ni was not on point on the case (but knowing we have Ni ter has allowed me much more modesty and genuine interest in the point of view of others, therefore less subjectivity), I have tended to use Ni way too much on whys and hows rather than using Se aux, which has left me feeling empty at times...

isfp,"Hi. Inspired by [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/isfp/comments/8emrrw/finally_found_a_nice_isfpish_job/) by an animal caretaker person, I thought I'd share a couple of quick observations from some of the jobs I've stumbled into. If anyone wants to share their own experiences, or comment on mine, then please feel free.  
  
*Bartending*  
I always felt out of place. It was a masquerade‚Äîbut the time flew by when it was busy, so the money felt easy.  
But not being myself took the spring out of my step.  
  
*Cook (short-order, small kitchen)*  
* Kitchens are a bit of a refuge for outcasts and weirdos, so it was fun letting loose.  
* A lot of jobs I've had play-down anything involving the senses, but a kitchen expects and rewards a critical eye, nose, ear, tongue.  
Manipulating the colours and forms when plating up was great fun - especially desserts.  
* I enjoyed working in a small team, getting to know a few people well. Supporting each other. The camaraderie, and also the in-jokes, and silliness. I never thought I'd consider myself a 'team player', but I guess I became one without realising.  
* That said‚Äîit was stressful, taxing on the working memory (I wanted to test my limits, but I never got the hang of it), and the 12-hour shifts felt like a sentence.  
And then there was the radio. The fucking radio.  
It's an easy job to get into, and I'm glad I did it. Give it a go if you have any interest.  
  
*Gardener*  
I had a cushy job looking after a few gardens for the local council.   
* I loved looking after the flowers, the immersion in colour. You do a job and immediately see the difference you've made.  
* Being a part of nature, the seasons being relevant, etc. I would be up for the orange glow of sunrise, and put the sprinklers out with the twilight. It was all very manicured‚Äîbut with all the smells and birdsong and whatnot, I became aware I was on the revolving earth.  
* I didn't do it for anyone else, but people would often come up and share their gratitude/appreciation. Plant people are lovely. (I'd inadvertently surrounded myself with relaxed, happy people).  
  
----  

I'll finish on a sour-ish note: I don't know if it's to do with type, or if it's me, but I've never felt like I *belonged* in any job I've had. Like, this is something I'm doing until I figure out how I want to spend the majority of my energy. I'm just standing-in until someone better suited comes along. I'm in the waiting room.  
  
When do you/don't you feel like an impostor?  

  
Still, I'm attracted to jobs where I have a small role with greater implications. A masseuse relieving a worker's pains so they can play with their children. A beekeeper spreading wildflower.

If I bring it up, she just goes, ""well, it's a kitten"" and if I push for a solution she'll offer to get rid of it.  I don't want her to get rid of it... I just want her to come home more often and play with it more so it doesn't bug me all the time. Or something... I'm totally open to ideas.  I just want her on my team to look for a solution... 

Also, all our logistics conversations seem to happen over text (she says she likes having the ability to think things through before she answers) but this means that conversations take days or hours, and in pauses I start imagining she's mad at me and stuff.

isfp,"Hi ISFP community!

New user here - please bear with me if I have done any form of mistakes here, still pretty fresh with the rules and all.

So recently I have known an ISFP, and I'm just trying to get close with her as a friend. Y'all are hella interesting and goofy and has this particular charm that sucks me in.

I want to get to know her better, but I seriously got no idea how to start. I've thought of directing questions I'm curious of to her, but I'm just afraid that she may feel that I'm trying to invade her privacy/life, make her feel uncomfortable and the last thing I want to do is to scare her off from my life. (+ It is really hard to read her throughout my years on knowing her) 

On top of this, I have social anxiety issues so when it comes to even talking to people, I'm like at the level of pit bottom. I think I also need to clarify that I have a tiny slight crush on her, so unsurprisingly her existence itself manages to make my brain malfunction whenever we hang out alone.

Just a background clarification if it matters:
I am an INFP (enneagram 6w5) with horrible social anxiety and conversation skills. 

So I need advice from you guys:
- Are you guys able to advice on any kind of ways I can approach her?
- What are the signs of intimacy you guys usually show when it comes to friends and what are the differences of treatment you do between acquaintances and friends (or maybe close friends)

Sorry if there are any forms of grammar/vocab error!",1525450333
isfp,"Do any of you also enjoy these types of games?
I find that in between moments of ""real life enjoyment"" I tend to indulge into creative games. 

Like, *I wont play the game in it's intented way*, I'll just indulge in my creativity.

For example, I'll turn cheats on in the Sims and build a fantasy house and play pretend scenarios.

I'll spend hours on creative minecraft mode building the most aesthetically lleasing buildings, exclusively.

I'll invent a play pretend life in GTA online where I could either have a young gangster living in the hood type of character or a grey-haired executive driving around in a rolls royce.

I would also role play on IMVU.. As a cop, a doctor, a mafiosi, a FBI agent, a paladin, a biker.. Etc etc etc

I would play Sim City and create cities around various themes.. I'd have an industrial town map, a futuristic map, a suburban town map, etc.

Tl;dr: Any one else use video games as creative outlets instead of their intended purpose?

But as school started our every day texting died out and when I try to converse with her it feels difficult both in text and IRL. There's bursts where we talk/text a ton and then moments where she just gives one word replies. She told me she's been busy which I totally understand and I've been really busy as well so it's understandable. But summer's coming up and so I'm going to see if we will be able to hang out or something.

We met online and are on opposite ends of the earth yet I can't stop thinking about her and how she 'gets me' in a way that none of my local friends do.
Our situation is a little bit odd in that I've told her that I have a crush on her and she didn't outright reject me, but she didn't accept either. She said that she didn't know how she felt about me in that way and we agreed not to make any advances until we meet in real life. Which is fair enough, I am aware that I'm probably imagining her as more perfect than she actually is due to the nature of the Internet and online messaging.

The ISFP knows it and while he does not encourage me to send it to her (via post), he lets me do what I want. The way he put it is if I want to show him the note that I want to write as a dedication to his mother, it is only after I have already posted it and there is nothing he could change about it.

He has a very close relationship with them and loves them and respects them deeply. Based on what he tells me, i realised that his mother would like to visit a place (where I have been and which impressed me forever). I bought a book which I already read in the past, about some legends and stories about the place and want to send it to her as a token of appreciation and gratitude. She is not yet aware of my existence, we never met but I feel like I want to thank her for the way she raised her son, my now bf. My bf surpsingly, although he did not disclose anything about us yet, wants me to go ahead and send this gift to his mother. He wants me not to leave him the choice to overthink about it or that his overthinking makes me overthink about it. He basically wants me to eventually tell him what I wrote already after the gift was sent by post. Is he actually seeking an external intervention from his mother (as she would definitely question him once she gets the gift) to reveal ""us"" to her? Thing is I just want to thank her, for doing such an amazing job in being his mother and how she instilled in him such powerful values...Any thoughts about this are welcome.

https://startupbros.com/overthinkers-guide-taking-action-complete-guide/

I'm an INTP by the way. Ti-Ne-Si, especially Ne-Si, is a bitch when it comes to breaking from routine. It's good at building routine, but what happens is you adapt and then get stuck. Ne is the ""In a sec"" function while Si is the conservative ""must make no mistakes"" function. Ne can take action, but it just chases reward and only does so if it gets it soon and if little to no conscious effort is required. Si can take action if it's routine.",1525027468
isfp,"Yesterday my ex contacted me (after 3 months of not talking to each other). I was surprised, but also relieved for reasons I couldn't explain. I thought I didn't want him anymore, but at that time I wanted to do nothing but talk to him. I was in a low mood. He said to me that he was worried about me and wanted to know how I was doing. It didn't seem like he had any bitter/resentful thoughts towards me. Still, when we talked again it was like we had never stopped talking. There was that same intense feeling of fondness towards him. I was so glad at that time. I appreciated his concern towards me, and truthfully I still appreciate him. But I just can't figure out my feelings towards him?? It's like I consider him as a close friend, but at that moment I felt love, but was it platonic love? I don't think it was. I don't think it was romantic either? I think it was somewhere in between. I felt that same closeness when I had been talking to him (texting) earlier. I feel like I shouldn't abandon him, but I also don't want to run into his arms declaring I would never leave him. It's like I'm really glad he's in my life but I still want to keep him at an arms length. He said that he would like to meet me again, but only if I wanted to. I can't figure out the ""do I want"" part. Does anyone else relate to indecisiveness when it comes to romantic feelings? Do you think my issue with him stems from incompatibility or something else? Am I being a horrible romantic partner? I feel like I should be honest towards my feelings here, and I also feel like he wants me to do the same. Anyways thanks for reading this romantic rant.

isfp,"Just a little rant, maybe you can share some insights with me. 

My isfp crush keeps going for these gossipy shallow but flirty and confident girls. I know one of his previous crushes was on a real bitch who said mean things about me behind my back (called me useless) while another gave me a mean stare. They both act really shallow like I said and I can see them being mean to others too. He got rejected by both. 

I dont think that he is compatible with those girls at all, if they get into a relationship I'm pretty sure he will end up being a pushover. They are not good for someone sensitive and soft hearted like him. However I can see why he would be attracted to girls like that, they display a certain power that he doesnt and they are on the surface very bubbly and happy

He has a history with feeling worthless and sometimes depressed but I think its improved. Sometimes I think that he needs to grow up a bit and choose girls who are more compatible. 

Hes someone Im very attracted to but I prefer to be a good friend to him as he is because thats the best I can do for him. I hope that he is able to find someone to be happy with though and when he does Ill support it. We are both 21 y/o",1524845826
isfp,"Found this amazing quote in a random ISFP profile and it hit *so* close to home.  I've always viewed the world in this outsider/alien type of way, but was never able to articulate it.  It's incredibly accurate for me.  Behold:

***""When it comes down to it, ISFP‚Äôs are naturally designed observers.  ISFP‚Äôs live their life always engaged in observation, like their entire existence is a movie and they are the audience behind their eye sockets.  Other types might find this to be a horrible existence, never being directly involved in life, but to the ISFP, the best experiences are the ones most people don‚Äôt even notice until they take a step back from all  the action.""***   

I'll admit it's a lonely feeling.  It's almost as if I'm never really experiencing reality in the present moment, but rather watching it all unfold from an outside, third person perspective. However, I believe the *upside* to this unique ""watcher"" perspective is that it allows us to notice all the subtleties and nuances that many others may completely miss. These subtleties and nuances are sometimes more special than the experience itself.

 The first thing i noticed was the difference in the vibe of my co workers. Everyones more introverted and calm, no gregarious high energy people that i have to feel pressured to make conversation with. The whole day was mostly quiet except for fish tanks bubbling and birds singing.

Its also a very low stress job. You have to be timely of course but you dont have to feel rushed and stressed out with multitasking. As long as you get everything done before its time to leave youre good. 

The best part is its in the back away from the customers so you never have to put on a customer service persona.

Computers, Photography, Hifi Audio, Weaving, Woodworking, Music, Wrist Watches, Video Games, Mechanical Keyboards and probably a few more at some point.

Honestly I could sit here and type ten paragraphs trying to explain all of my hobbies but I won't.

Im in a romantic relationship with an ISFP and it seemed to be going well the first month we started dating. Its now the third month and it feels like we've grown universes far apart. We both have full time jobs on the weekdays so we agreed to hang out on the weekends but we havent been hanging out at all lately due to his demanding job which leaves him pretty exhausted and I understand that. I understand the need for space and time he needs alone. However when we are together hes very low energy and doesnt seem to appreciate my company like he used to. (I understand that its probably due to his high stress job too) We dont even text that much anymore, like a few texts a day then nothing. Noticing this and being the overthinking, clingy, emotional person I am, I did what most people would advise otherwise to do and just opened up a big bag of emotional word-vomit through text basically asking if he has grown tired of me or thinks Im annoying...
He told me he isnt annoyed by me and seems to want to continue dating me despite how overbearing I am. 
Hes a sweet guy and I would spend all my free time with him if i could but he seems to be unphased by how little we hang out and the lack of communication.

Below is an overview of the Big 5 for those who are unfamiliar.

-----

[*From wikipedia:*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits)

&gt; * **Openness** to experience (inventive/curious vs. consistent/cautious)  
Appreciation for art, emotion, adventure, unusual ideas, curiosity, and variety of experience. Openness reflects the degree of intellectual curiosity, creativity and a preference for novelty and variety a person has. It is also described as the extent to which a person is imaginative or independent and depicts a personal preference for a variety of activities over a strict routine. High openness can be perceived as unpredictability or lack of focus, and more likely to engage in risky behaviour or drug taking. Also, individuals that have high openness tend to lean towards being artists or writers in regards to being creative and appreciate the significance of the intellectual and artistic pursuits. Moreover, individuals with high openness are said to pursue self-actualization specifically by seeking out intense, euphoric experiences. Conversely, those with low openness seek to gain fulfillment through perseverance and are characterized as pragmatic and data-driven‚Äîsometimes even perceived to be dogmatic and closed-minded. Some disagreement remains about how to interpret and contextualize the openness factor.

&gt;* **Conscientiousness** (efficient/organized vs. easy-going/careless)  
A tendency to be organized and dependable, show self-discipline, act dutifully, aim for achievement, and prefer planned rather than spontaneous behavior. High conscientiousness is often perceived as stubbornness and obsession. Low conscientiousness is associated with flexibility and spontaneity, but can also appear as sloppiness and lack of reliability.

&gt;* **Extraversion** (outgoing/energetic vs. solitary/reserved)  
Energy, positive emotions, surgency, assertiveness, sociability and the tendency to seek stimulation in the company of others, and talkativeness. High extraversion is often perceived as attention-seeking, and domineering. Low extraversion causes a reserved, reflective personality, which can be perceived as aloof or self-absorbed. Extroverted people tend to be more dominant in social settings, opposed to introverted people who may act more shy and reserved in this setting.

&gt;* **Agreeableness** (friendly/compassionate vs. challenging/detached)  
A tendency to be compassionate and cooperative rather than suspicious and antagonistic towards others. It is also a measure of one's trusting and helpful nature, and whether a person is generally well-tempered or not. High agreeableness is often seen as naive or submissive. Low agreeableness personalities are often competitive or challenging people, which can be seen as argumentativeness or untrustworthiness.

&gt;* **Neuroticism** (sensitive/nervous vs. secure/confident)  
Neuroticism identifies certain people who are more prone to psychological stress. The tendency to experience unpleasant emotions easily, such as anger, anxiety, depression, and vulnerability. Neuroticism also refers to the degree of emotional stability and impulse control and is sometimes referred to by its low pole, ""emotional stability"". A high stability manifests itself as a stable and calm personality, but can be seen as uninspiring and unconcerned. A low stability expresses as a reactive and excitable personality, often very dynamic individuals, but they can be perceived as unstable or insecure. It has also been researched that individuals with higher levels of tested neuroticism, tend to have worse psychological well being.

[*From a peer-reviewed paper:*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0191886996000335):

&gt;The NEO-PI Agreeableness score was correlated only with the thinking-feeling (T-F) dimension; the NEO-PI Conscientiousness score was correlated with both thinking-feeling and judging-perceiving (J-P) dimension; the NEO-PI Extraversion score was strongly correlated with the extraversion-introversion (E-I) dimensions, while the Neuroticism score from the NEO-PI was not related to any MBTI subscale score. The openness dimension was correlated with all four especially sensing-intuitive.",1521863430

isfp,"For me:

Games:

Action-Adventure/Hack &amp; Slash (think God of War, Metal Gear Rising type games), RPG (mainly oldschool sprite-based ones, but also more action-oriented ones like Skyrim and Fallout), Survival Horror (Silent Hill, Dino Crisis) and platformers (Mega Man, mainly) are my favorites. I'm not really into puzzle games or FPS games.

Anime:

Action, drama, thriller, horror and sci-fi are neat. I generally don't really like slice of life and romance, but there are some exceptions.

Movies:

I only really watch movies for horror and thriller, since they are scarce in anime. Outside of that, a good drama or comedy movie can be nice.",1521841318
isfp,"I've been spending a lot of time on the istp sub and I've been really enjoying myself. I love their similar sense of humor and they have really interesting and relatable ways of thinking. While they can seem hostile or inconsiderate, they're a okay I'm my book.

How do you feel about them? Are they too harsh for you or can you overlook their Ti dom and let them get a laugh out of you?",1521768524
isfp,"I appreciate art and music, but haven't put any time into doing it myself. I would like to pick up a guitar over the summer. I used to be into fashion but I've found myself wearing just t shirts recently. I just find a lot of summaries of our personality trait as ""the artist."" ",1521681157
isfp,"When I'm not practicing/listening to music, I tend to watch YouTube, play video games and watch a little anime here and there. Pretty standard imo. What kind of hobbies do you have that don't cater to your creative side? ",1521600278

isfp,"Every time i start to talk to someone im romantically interested in, i become completely obsessed with them. Im not talking stalker level obsession, just as soon as i know i want to develop a relationship i just can't. stop. thinking. about. that. person. This is actually my biggest problem that interferes with my mental health since i become sooo infatuated with that person i get depressed whenever things don't work and it takes me forever to get over it bc of how much i liked them. I always see posts of ISFPs having trouble with long term relationships but i feel like i have the opposite problem. Do any other ISFPs develop crushes really easily? or often become obsessed with liking their crush? ",1521494456
isfp,"Hi all

So I have an ISFP friend and I am wanting to get to know them better. Also wanting them to open up more I feel I am often sharing more stuff with them than they are with me. Any advice would be much appreciated.

Thanks ",1521428093
isfp,"I find that I learn quickest through visual learning. I like graphs and charts and if I can see it, I can probably learn it. But I find that if I learn by doing, it takes me a while but I get an overall better understanding of whatever it is.

How do the rest of you isfp's like to learn? The three main ones are visual (seeing), auditory (hearing), and kinesthetic (doing), but you may have a specific way that is unique and works best for you.",1521417713
isfp,"People always tell me I‚Äôm an extremely likable person, but yet I‚Äôve always had trouble romantically.  In past relationships I‚Äôve been told that I seem too uninterested and that I don‚Äôt put enough ‚Äúwork‚Äù into things such as making plans.  Also, people have taken offense from me wanting to be alone sometimes, but that‚Äôs just an integral part of who I am.

It just seems like my personality is not the best for long-term relationships.  Making friends is very easy, but anything more is extremely difficult.

Can anyone else relate to this or perhaps share some advice?",1521375220
isfp,"Is there another type that you know you're not but you wish you were? Some websites show isfp to be the ""worst"" type (I know there's no worst type but read similarminds.com has to say about us). Do you mind having a biased negative connotation to us or are you indifferent to how others think of you?",1521345941
isfp,"I always wanted to be a musician for the pit orchestras on braodway. Didn't work out too well because I wasn't willing to put in the time and effort to really master the craft of music. It's still a hobby and I find any opportunities that I can still play here and there.A

 Now I'm going to school to be a biochemist and it's working out really well. I'm excited to work in the field even though it's not my ""artistic"" passion.

Do you make your living as a full time ""artist"" and get a low paying job in order to feel happy or are you okay with working a common job to live comfortably? Maybe you tried following your passion but failed and ended up like me or other opposite: you ignored your passion and got a dead beat job somewhere that you now hate.",1521328835

isfp,I'm doing field research ;p,1521243197
isfp,"Also which instruments/sounds do you typically tend to focus on when listening to music? 

To me bass is often important, I also like the repeating piano chords in the background ([kind of like in this one](https://youtu.be/Y5Cj2FVzrsk?t=2m52s)). I usually notice sounds that are more in the background than those in the forefront.",1521230384
isfp,"Yesterday, I realized I had lost my wallet when I got home. I wasn't too woried about it because I was tired and I didn't want to make a big deal about it. When I told my partner he freaked out and started looking everywhere for it. I knew it wasn't stolen because I put it in my pocket when I left my car so I must have put it down somewhere in our house.

 Long story short he got his whole family looking for it which  made everyone else stressed out and loud which in turn made me stressed, but not because of had lost my wallet lmao. It was because everyone else was tense and in my face and asking me the same questions over and over again. In the end I found it right outside my car (I missed my pocket I guess).

So my question today is, do you lose things frequently? I almost never lose important articles but trivial stuff I lose all the time. Do you get anxious when you lose important things, or do you try and stay calm and relaxed?",1521216275
isfp,"Hello friends! Us isfp's are well known for our carefree attitudes and adventurous tendencies and we hate to be ""shoved into a box,"" including the box that is the isfp personality sometimes. I am unique and although I do relate to the standard isfp model there are things about me that you wouldn't quite expect.

1. I love the color grey. As the most artistic personally, grey would seem to be the least likely to be favored because it has no personality. I just love it though because it sort of represents my philosophy on life that nothing is black and white. You have to look at controversial issues from multiple perspectives to get the full picture and it ends up being somewhat of a grey area. Also it's just astheticly  pleasing bc it brings out the vibrancy all the other colors. 

2. I learn best with concepts, not applications. Generally, personalities with the S trait only want to learn unless there is a practical application to it. For me, learning the application before the concept can be really confusing bc in the real world there's always exceptions but learning a theoretical model can make things much more simple and easy to understand. Once the concept is understood, the application to that concept can flow right in. I know I'm iSfp and not iNfp because I'm naturally a perfectionist and I tend to be better at pointing out differences in minute details than others. 

3. I SUCK at creating my own artistic works but I'm great and taking what others create and adding my own personality to them. For some reason if I have a blank mind, it will stay blank. But if I'm inspired somehow by someone else's creativity I get so full of ideas.

So that's me, but what kind of uniqueness do you bring to the isfp table? Maybe an uncommon hobby or habit that you wouldn't think a standard isfp would do. I know it can be hard to open up but I think it's fun to get some perspective into the lives of others. Also, I'm thinking about trying to regularly post here to get some insight on how people like me live and maybe make some knew like-minded friends allong the way :) C√≠ao! ",1521093171
isfp,"Alright. I'm pretty good at being my carefree, weird self when I'm in the right mood to socialize or when I've warmed up to someone. BUT for some reason when I have a big crush on someone I kind of shut down when I talk to them and everything feels awkward and like I'm pushing them away or don't like them? This really happens when there are other people around and the person I have feelings for approaches me... does this happen to anyone else? Ugh. I'll send a text like ""hey can we talk after such and such event?"" and then when they approach me at the event asking what I wanted to talk about I'm like ""oh, that was really nothing..."" like ?!? wtf me?! Then, when we hang out alone eventually I warm up to talking to them and everything is fine and I can be myself again and have a great time. I feel like I'm giving really mixed signals and I'm worried I'm going to push them away.
does this happen to anyone else? How did you fix it??",1521057388

isfp,"Hellooooo!

I'm an infj and this sub's been a little calm these days, so I figured I'd get around to asking some questions about you guys I've always wondered. I'd appreciate any response, Happy Tuesday! 

1) What do you normally think about/wonder (/when you're alone, if they differ)?

2) Do you enjoy taking yourself out on dates/doing things alone, or is it hard to enjoy because you'd rather experience things with others?

3) How do you reward yourself?

4) What are your guilty pleasures?

However, I don't feel like I'm communicating the best (I love to text, he doesn't). I also tend to initiate asking him to hang out, which he usually rain checks, and then later asks me to do something (I ask by text, he usually asks in person). 

Any tips on how best to approach an ISFP early? And in particular, are there likely behaviors I'm exhibiting (100000% ENFP here) that you as an ISFP would rather us ENFPs not do?

isfp,"We have this link stickied at the top of our ENTJ group - I've linked the ISFP version for discussion... It's very spot-on for my ISFP. 

http://www.sociotype.com/socionics/types/SEI-ISFp/

Do you ever catch yourselves when you're bottoming out? When work or home life is crashing? When your health is poor and getting worse? When a SO is about to leave you? 

The link mentions reluctance to think about the future - does that ever change?

Even in trying times, when I've had to snap my ISFP out of his coma - he'll slip back into it once all hell stops breaking loose. 

Does the world really need to be falling down around your shoulders to get your attention? Do you worry about your health, your job, your relationships? What would make you do something about it? 

As an ENTJ, I just have to let most things go or I'm seen as harsh, then I look up and my ISFP is completely gone! Why make me the bad guy? I don't want to be! 

**SEIs are often highly disinclined to engage in productive tasks, and may be inclined to react to ""responsible"" individuals or environments as overly somber, cold, or dull. They often see the hustle and bustle of working concerns to be insignificant, preferring to focus on their own comfort and friendships.**

So, how do you guys not get fired? Mine had his mother take him aside in his *late* 20's and give him a heads up that he was about to get the ax because (issues)...  He's well old enough not to get this lecture again, but it could happen.

isfp,"Hey dudes! An INTP 9w8 here. Just wanted to share how my ISFP friend mistyped as an INFJ. She is an enneagram type 1w2, which is pretty common for INFJs. Type 1 generally made her appear more ‚ÄúJ‚Äù, so she never considered that she was a ‚ÄúP‚Äù type. Her tertiary Ni is somewhat developed and I would say that she often gets into loops, making her think that her Se is lower than it actually is.

Most ISFPs are enneagram types 9 and 4, and enneagram has a big impact on your personality and actions, so she doesnt at all relate to any ISFP online descriptions. After showing her the descriptions for the single functions in ISFP positions, she definately related more. She scores higher on Te in cognitive function tests, due to her enneagram type 1.

I thought it would be cool to share, and to see if any of you have a more unusual enneagram for ISFPs and how that affected the processes of discovering your MBTI type?",1520343221
isfp,"I have an ISFP friend and I also have some social anxiety, and so I tend to say things like ""sorry for being annoying"" routinely... do you think that you would interpret insecurities of this kind as a lack of trust? I trust her a lot, and I don't want her to think it's her fault that I'm worried about annoying her... it's a completely irrational fear and she has told me time and time again that I'm not annoying... but of course I can't ask her if the constant apologies are annoying because that would imply that I didn't trust her... I'm worried that she might translate my insecurity into me not trusting her...",1520277997
isfp,"I'm hoping you all can help me with being a good partner to my girlfriend.  My goal is always to make her feel valued, to help her where I can, and not to be too intrusive into helping her since I can be a bit controlling if I'm not careful.

I love that my girlfriend is such a good companion, normally has a great attitude, has a great sense of humor, and a perspective that compliments my own.  ...but she's kind of a pushover.  There were some important health things she needed to schedule with doctors, and she is so laissez-faire that she just asked for an appointment without any attempt to get a sooner one, to get on a waiting list, to impress upon them that this is actually a bit more *urgent* even though I'd talked with her about it beforehand.  We're talking potentially life-altering bodily damage if she didn't make an appointment soon, and there was basically no assertiveness or urgency.  I just didn't get it.  

Her rationale was that she didn't want to inconvenience people.  Mine was that mildly irritating a scheduling clerk isn't going to debilitate that clerk for life, but that delaying on this could permanently damage her health, and that I couldn't schedule it for her, so she needed to be more assertive and politely and persistently push them for an earlier appointment.  She finally did after a lot of exhortation from my end.

Fast forward a few weeks.  My request for her to be more assertive wasn't forgotten.  She recently made a very impulsive decision that I found upsetting.  When I probed into her motivations for doing what she did, her response was ""You asked me to be more assertive, but when I am, you're unhappy with it since you don't agree with my decision.""

That's... not true.  I'm unhappy because she made a rash decision on a whim, which affects other people, without discussing it with me or anyone else, and without good reasons for doing it.  Do I think she needs my persmission?  No, she's an adult.  ...but she wasn't exactly acting like an adult.  She just felt like doing it and did it and didn't think of the potential negative consequences for herself or others.  If she'd have talked it over with me I'd have still disagreed with her, but I wouldn't have been half as upset since she at least communicated something with me.

It was pretty painfully apparent in those moments that as much as I love many of her qualities, her ability to critically think through decisions and their likely consequences is a bit lacking...  She couldn't articulate her rationales to me when I tried to understand them.  She didn't fully understand her own feelings and motivations as we talked about it either.  She felt something -&gt; She took action.

How have you matured in these areas (assertiveness/critical thinking)?  What can I do as a partner to help?  She's bound to make some really upsetting decisions that negatively affects us both if she doesn't get a little better in this area.",1520261196

It is difficult to make him change his mind. Can be very stubborn and intractable. Sensitive, prudish, dislikes imposing his company. Internally highly critical and applies his high ethical standards to other people, though may not openly voice this. If his principles are touched, he can suddenly show his character, becoming sharp and uncompromising. Hardworking and practical. - [**Full description**](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=ESI_subtypes)

**ISFP-Se** - The sensory subtype is quite strict, critical, and ironic. Categorical in conclusions and uncompromising in decisions. Internally sensitive and emotional, but tries to appear as strong, cold, self-assured person. Serious, guarded, and private. Conservative in his tastes and habits. Diligent in work, though sometimes he lacks in attention and perseverance to complete his assignments. At times seems unapproachable, arrogant, and prickly. His gaze is piercing.

isfp,"Hello! So I‚Äôve been best friends with an ESFJ for about 3 years. We met at work and both still work at the same company, but in different departments. We both started off as runners and have slowly been making our way up the ladder. Where I‚Äôve had slow progression in my department, she‚Äôs been able to move up quite quickly purely due to the fact that there has just been a quicker rotation and more oppportunities to be promoted. 

Every single position she‚Äôs had, she‚Äôs always had something to moan about it. She‚Äôs never been content in the job and is always looking to see how she can get the next job, or annoyed as to why she hasn‚Äôt got the opportunity to be promoted yet. Recently, she was promoted and has started her new position. She‚Äôs only been in the role for 2 weeks and already she‚Äôs moaning about the work, after having expressed that she wanted this promotion whilst in her previous role. I‚Äôm starting to lose my shit. I‚Äôm already having to keep myself positive and motivated being in my very slow moving department with hardly any progression. I feel like I carry a lot of her stress on my shoulders when she rants to me and I try my best to make sure I‚Äôm there when she needs to talk and giving her advice to keep her spirits high. It‚Äôs getting to the point now that I am irritated by her messages and the irritation is filtering through into other aspect of our friendship. 

Today I found out I didn‚Äôt get a job at another company I really wanted, and messaged her to tell her the news. She‚Äôs replied kinda, but has recently stopped replying to my messages in which I‚Äôm clearly looking for someone to talk to. Luckily, I have other friends etc I can talk to, and that‚Äôs not really the issue here. I think I‚Äôm just feeling a bit miffed that I put a lot of time and energy into making her feel better, that I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm getting the same in return. Even things like, when she‚Äôs applying for job roles, I help her with her CV and cover letter etc, and when I asked her to help me reply to one email concerning my job interview, she said she‚Äôd do it and then completely forgot.

I guess I‚Äôm asking is am I over thinking this too much and should I just accept that this is how she is? Should I stop bothering trying to make her feel better all the time if she doesn‚Äôt seem to want to do the same for me? Is she even listening to my advice or will she continue to always be unhappy in everything she does?

isfp,"So throughout my life, I've loved to try new experiences, I've loved to build things with my hands, I've loved to create physical sculptures, to see the fruits of my labors. In high school, I got into game development, thinking that it would be a good intersection of an artistic and lucrative profession.

Through the end of high school and all through college, I had this dream of being an indie game developer, thinking I'd one day be able to make a game that was lucrative enough to dig me out of this hole that I felt I was living in. I think it was this dream of not having to work the corporate 9-5 that kept me going. So somehow, I actually find an opportunity to pull this off, to get some funding and start a company. However, now that things have calmed down, I've never felt more unfulfilled in my life. 

All I've ever wanted ever, since I was just a kid, was a girlfriend, and yet, I've never been able to get one. For some reason, I felt that having money would be enough, but as I have finally gained financial independence, I can see (and to many this is obvious), that this is such a small part of the equation.

I think part of the reason I can't find someone is that I act really desperate, because the truth is I am. Programming feels like rock compared to the clouds and water and fire of love. I'd don't love programming, I don't love myself so I'm desperate to find emotional fulfillment somewhere else.

It seems to me that finding a job that hits close to the feeling of love is the only way I could make a relationship work. The only problem is, I have extremely limited skill in the artistic/athletic pursuits that seem to sufficiently entertain other ISFPs. I feel pretty stuck. My parents are extremely narcissistic and authoritarian so there's no way I'm going back home... 

Any suggestions? I really appreciate any thoughts.

isfp,"So supposedly SP types, including ISFPs, are very impulsive in general. That's true in my experience, though depending on if this is really an ISFP thing it's not always in a good or even proactive way.

I find that a lot of my impulsivity manifests, for lack of a better word, in laziness. I'll have a small part of a project as a daily goal, for example to complete a transition between two songs or something. But as soon as I start, I'll decide it's high time to go make some coffee or a pasta sauce, or maybe watch that Youtube video I just remembered. Useless stuff like that, that is fun for about ten minutes until I realise I just wasted all that time.

And as for positive impulsivity, like calling a friend over or going on a walk... well, then my old friend overthinking (alter ego probably Fi-Ni loop) steps in and tells me to stay in the house. :\

I guess the purpose of this post is twofold - to find if MBTI has any explanations for this and to help any other ISFPs who may have this issue feel less isolated, given the ""go-getter actioney ISFP"" tendency, or stereotype, or both, whichever it may be. Also random curiosity. :D

isfp,"in english class, we learned about the concept of sublime in romantic literature and i think its something that would resonate with us (it probably resonates with everybody regardless of type but i feel like it‚Äôs especially amplified with us and i‚Äôve attributed it to fi+se). it‚Äôs basically the feeling of awe and wonder that arises in the presence of natural beauty. romanticism is very fi because it entailed opposition to organised structures and strongly emphasised individuality. the romantic poets also believed that the emotional power of nature transcended rationality.
anyway i fell in love with this idea because even looking at pictures of nature makes me feel a sense of calm i can‚Äôt quite describe. i get lost in the beauty of the world and the richness in colours. in these moments, thinking about meaning doesn‚Äôt come naturally to me. fi+se is not concerned with creating meaning but just experiencing and appreciating the full moment and seeing it as what it is and that‚Äôs okay. maybe there‚Äôs meaning in that - does something have to be profoundly meaningful in order for it to be valued?",1517647791

We're pretty platonic. He tells me everything, and comes to me for 'love advice'. 7 months ago, he started liking this girl called J. They study together quite a lot, but he's never had the guts to ask her out. As you know, 7 months is hella long. So the possibility of them dating became farfetched and unrealistic (for me at least). 

For the past 2 weeks, ISFP started getting more than friendly with me. Nothing outright, but a perceptive person would be able to tell he'd amped the eye contact up. He offered to buy me dinner, started teasing me aaaand walked me home for a week straight. He got protective too? He told my friend to leave me out of this thing he knew I hated, and when I asked him why he did that, he said ""Welllll I care for you"". We were close friends before, but never this close.

SO OK HERE'S THE CLIMAX. Yesterday my friend made a bet with him: if he lost he had to ask J out. He lost. And he asked J out. And J said yes. (He called me when I was in class to deliver the good news). 

I had to spend the afternoon in the library watching them cosy up to each other ARGRGFH. And later on I had to act all excited and ""wow congrats dude!!;!1!!1!!!"" as he thanked me for supporting him for the past 7 months.

I'm new here. My entire life I always considered myself an INFP and I'm still fairly split between INFP/ISFP. I just wanted to get some outside input on this and see if anyone has a similar situation. 

After my first semester of college as a design major, I realized that while my roommate (also a design major and ENFP) was always focused on finding and explaining deep meanings in her work I just wanted my work to speak for itself and be what it is. 

I've always had this part of my brain in school that wants to find the real world application for everything I'm learning otherwise I tend to tune out and not take it seriously. 
I enjoy extreme downhill skiing- especially moguls and tree runs because you only have to focus on the next thing in front of you and not the entire mountain. I also really love challenging acting roles in theater and have always been known as a great ""in the moment"" actor. I'm impulsive and not very money savvy and I often feel the need to go out and explore by myself. 

BUT I do consider myself an idealist and overthink situations that have happened/are happening/will happen and I'm not very good at remembering small details. Because of this, on online personality tests, I tend to score more N than S.

isfp,"Last NYE I was at a concert (edm) with friends plus their friends. I met two girls. 

1 was to my right and 1 was to my left. most would say Right was more attractive. but when stripped from instinctual desires from the LSD, I was drawn to Left. 

Through the loud  bass beating against my body, intense plethora of lights creating a crazy Fantasia 2000 like scenary, and rad dancing from the big group (20 ish ppl) , I would occasionally look at her and make eye contact and just smile. I could feel it directly in my body as though she understood me and exactly how I felt from the overall environment when I couldn't physically put together words because of how overwhelming all my sensations from the experience was .  there was some weird energy that drew me towards her.  I physically couldn't formulate words more complex than ""this is so crazy"". this experience is very odd and hard for me to explain. I felt as though our energies balanced each other out. 

All I knew about this girl was her name through us being introduced. through her eyes and physical cues I believe I could just tell this girl was 100%  true to herself and top notch in terms of someone to be around.

After the concert, we all parted ways and I couldn't get to know her. it's hard for an ENTJ to describe feelings so sorry for that. I believe this girl is ISFP after a year of consideration and having mutual friends describing her personality and lifestyle. That part of the concert still has me wondering a year later. Can you truly understand and be drawn to someone without even talking to them? I feel as though I found exactly the type of girl I would like to have in my life. The whole experience made me realize how superficial ""what do you do"" type of conversations were, as well as how unappreciative I was towards life, as well as many other compelling thoughts that are irrelevant to this post. 

Feelings defy all logic and this is truly a weird territory for me. Think typical ENTJ and that's me. Our function stacks are in reverse order and apparently we psychologically fulfill each other. I'm not exactly sure what I expect to gain from this post but oh well. Let's chat :)",1514427960
isfp,"I'm kind of looking for a second opinion on something, in case I was overlooking something.

I had a crush on a girl for a while, who I'm pretty sure is an ISFP. She knew about it, but she starting dating someone else. I'm okay with being friends instead, especially if it meant we could talk - but she never says anything back. I try to write supportive comments on her art posts online, yet she always leaves me hanging. She doesn't block me either, even though there wouldn't be any consequences. I don't know if she's mad at me, if it's just awkward, or if she's worried that her boyfriend might feel hurt or jealous if she talked to me. I don't really want to confront her about it as if I'm entitled to be her friend... and really I shouldn't have to. 

When I try to talk to her, one one level I'm checking to see if she's ready to be friends. But on another, I'm worried that she's sacrificing a lot of time and energy to make the other relationships in her life work, but no one's really checking to see if she's doing okay. It's kind of like there's a mask there and she's not really putting herself out there like she once did. It's almost like she's putting off dealing with the things that are really bothering her.

A few months ago I came across an INFJ channel called VaseFace, and I believed her to be a mistype although I wasn't completely sure of her actual type. Now that I've watched a few more of her videos, I'm almost positive that she's ISFP.

Everything was going wonderfully and we were having so much fun with each other over the course of two months in our ‚Äúnew‚Äù relationship.... until 

He got drunk one Saturday night and told me I was ‚Äúhis‚Äù so I said ‚Äúthat means you are mine‚Äù and he said ‚Äúyeah but I would fuck *this other girl we both know *‚Äù and I was appalled. I was so upset and I told him that and his response was ‚ÄúI‚Äôm always going to be honest‚Äù

Recently, things have been very stressful for both of us and we've both been acting a bit unhealthy - though my antics have been more apparent and visible. I have an issue with anxiety, and that causes me to be extremely whiny, controlling, cynical, and selfish when I'm really stressed. Evidently, this had been affecting my ISFP friend really hard, because they very abruptly ended the friendship.
While I was definitely at fault for my behavior (and I'm getting that sorted out), this is a temporary state. I'm not usually this way, but my friend decided to REALLY abruptly end a three year friendship that's been extremely close. He's shown extreme loyalty in the past, but now suddenly ends it all. Even more bizarre was that he had said NOTHING up until this point. Me and our other close friend literally had no idea he was upset. He didn't say one word at all, and even he apologized for being so secretive about his feelings (though I don't think he realizes just how much damage this secrecy has caused. If he had said literally anything at all, I would've reformed myself. But I had NO idea)
We did do some talking, but things are still unclear if my ISFP friend is really going to stay friends with me or not. I know it's in the nature of ISFP's (when stressed or unhealthy) to sort of abruptly abandon/run away from things, as well as get caught up in their own emotions and lose all empathy.

I know how it feels to feel down and out. 

To feel broken. 

Waking up every morning questioning my own existence and it's value to other people and significance to the world. 

I know how it feels to wear a mask for the sake of others while trying my best to fool myself into believing that very mask is my true face. 

The wish to die is not brought by pain, it's brought by fear. 

Pain can be managed, decompressed and dealt with. Pain is an aching sort of ailment, dull, depressive and hollow. But fear is far more potent. It is sharp and always felt. Fear is a difficult and ruthless beast. 

Fear gnaws away at your soul until you lose all control. You can't escape it. You can attempt disassociation or whatever other concievable coping mechanism imaginable, but fear will always wait for you at the door. 

Fear that you are not good enough, that you will never succeed. Fear that you are not loved, that you are hated, ugly and unecessary. Worthless. Pathetic. Disgusting. Unworthy. Fake. 

Fear is masterful in the art of deception. You lie to yourself and are caught in a cycle of self defeat due to false beliefs constructed by your own insecurities and weaknesses that fear uses against you to manipulate you into sabatoging yourself.

The only way to combat fear is to confront it. 

To confront fear is to confront yourself. 

Confronting oneself and emerging victorious is torturous. But a Phoenix must rise from it's ashes if it is to fly.

Shedding the ashes of insecurity, doubt and self hate and bursting into flame. All of your weakness melting away as you spread your wings taking to the sky, soaring towards the sun reborn. 

To live is to reinvent yourself.

The wish to die may never leave me and fear will always remind me of it's power and presence, but the beauty of the Phoenix is the power of rebirth. 

To die, to rise, to die, to rise. Never giving up. The eternal fight and cycle. 

So yes, I am one of many broken people. The desire for death I recognize is a part of me, yet despite that curse I realize I also desire to live. So I will struggle against fear to continue to live. 

I may lose battles now and again, but I refuse to lose the war.

I know some days I will be deceived and fall into despair. But I won't give up. No one should give up. It doesn't matter how far you fall. You can always climb back up. 

Failure is a choice.

Even if you lose your legs and are unable to stand, crawl. Surrendering is the greatest weakness of all. It is true cowardice. If you continue to fight, you will discover that drive to live is an unlimited source of power you can tap into whenever you need it most. 

That power is within you and will always be within you. It's your identity.

A human soul is the greatest weapon of all convention. Never turn that blade toward yourself, but to the heart of the negative manifestations that afflict you. 

There is a path out of darkness and into light only if you remove your hand from your eyes.

isfp,"Hello Everyone,

I'm working on a psychology project examining the accuracy of romantic partners perceptions of personality, emotions, and work behaviors. I pretested the survey for length, if you both have just 20 minutes to spare, have been in a romantic relationship for a year or more, are both 18 years old or older, and employed you can participate. I will be granting access to your personal results through a password-protected system. If you would be willing to help a young student out, I would really appreciate your time and effort.

Thanks again,

isfp,"Male INFJ I've been crazy in love with a female ISFP for nearly 17 years now. God I've held onto her for the longest time yet over that time she has emotionally constrained herself to the point of no communication for nearly three years now. I believed and believed yes I know I'm crazy but when I fell in love with her at the beginning I made a vow in my heart that I would do whatever it takes to love her, and that included every worst case scenario. Anyway worst case scenario happened and true to my vow I have kept my heart's love alive for her since. But God is so hard to love someone who has become so emotionally constrained to this degree. I've been burned out on her emotional constrained behaviour before. Enduring 6 months of no contact. Endured 18 months after she moved of her not letting me know where she was. This time it's been 3 years almost with no text messages whatsoever from her, never mind verbal communication, that's definitely not happening. Can I hang in there and win her heart eventually, will she ever stop constraining herself to this degree? I have too many words and emotions that I can't possibly do justice to the entire story, this is but a snippet of the whole picture. ",1510322250
isfp,"Hello. First time poster! 

I‚Äôve re-written this post so many times cause I can‚Äôt seem to make it make sense! But here goes...

I am intrigued about how you fellow ISFPs feel about texting? I don‚Äôt mind sending texts when I have to. In general, I prefer to write down what I have to say as I am able to choose my words carefully, and I find it much easier to collect my thoughts. However, I hate receiving texts. The feeling of having to reply straight away makes me feel anxious and as well as that, I often seem to misread the context of texts or I sense the wrong tone. This usually results in unneccesary arguments or I end up feeling annoyed and confused because I don‚Äôt understand what the other person is trying to say/or why they‚Äôre choosing to text me this? I think in general I prefer to have conversations face to face.

So, my best friend loves to text. She‚Äôs the kind of person who will send several bursts of texts, that she could just write in one text. She will always be the first person to text at the beginning of the day. If she didn‚Äôt text me, we probably wouldn‚Äôt talk for days. She also texts more friviously, whereas when I text someone it‚Äôs for a purpose. Some of the things she‚Äôs texts really annoy me sometimes and I often wonder why she is texting me such things and I‚Äôll find myself feeling annoyed with her, when really there is nothing to be annoyed about.  When I see her in person we‚Äôll be chatting away and getting on like a house on fire, and there are no misunderstandings.

I guess I‚Äôm just asking/wondering if anyone else feels the same way about texting? Or often misreads tone/context? What are your texting habits?





",1510085893
isfp,"Curious to see if there are others similar to me, as I have yet to meet someone that is anywhere near similar.

I‚Äôm a 24 year old average female, and an ISFP, which I believe may add some insight as to why I enjoy being alone. I‚Äôm very much in the moment and I‚Äôm horrible at planning, whether it‚Äôs short term or long term. 

I have never once been in a relationship or desired a relationship, although I‚Äôve had many opportunities to have one. I have a guy friend currently that I enjoy talking to and is undoubtedly attracted to me and doesn‚Äôt shy in letting me know, but as soon as I even envision being in a relationship I get a sort of anxiety and ignore any advance at dating. 

I have many friends that are married, dating, or cannot emotionally be single and must always be in a relationship, that have been puzzled as to how I could possibly be content and full on my own. I‚Äôve even had a friend ask to tell her friend how great it is to be single and not need to constantly search for male interaction. It felt very odd trying to explain how I‚Äôve always been, just as she would feel odd explaining why she feels the need to have a constant companion. I‚Äôm somehow the friend that gives amazing advice without even having experience in relationships, having the ability to observe everything I‚Äôve seen and put it together for a specific problem or question a friend is having.

I understand that it‚Äôs the societal norm for humans to seek relationships, so I‚Äôm not shocked that my family and acquaintances are always wondering what it is about me, why am I so odd that I wouldn‚Äôt want to date. How could I not want to date? I don‚Äôt have an answer. I just am what I am. 

I have a feeling it‚Äôs a mixture of how relaxed and independent I am, and that I‚Äôm so comfortable and full on my own that the idea of ‚Äúfinding your other half‚Äù is so baffling and unfamiliar to me. Maybe I‚Äôll date in the future, maybe I won‚Äôt. My ISFP personality confirms that I don‚Äôt worry about the future, and would love for my family and friends to understand that I truly am happy with myself for now. 

Would love to know if anyone else feels the same! I‚Äôve searched many times and somehow have not come up with much.",1509934535

Our interactions revolve solely around sex when we hangout, we never do anything else together. But then when we aren't together he messages me to keep in contact.

I've started to develop some sort of feelings for said ISFP. Although, I have a difficult time picking up on how he's feeling since being kind and considerate is in his nature. He invites me to hangout with him and his friends sometimes but I try not to read into that too much considering they were with him at the bar when we met.

isfp,"Hi all! :)

So for the past, I don't know, 3 months or so, I've been furiously researching jobs that I might enjoy. As a first-year student at a large public university on a full ride, I was originally going to pursue business, but soon found that was a horrible mismatch. I then focused on actuarial science - but, as an ISFP (MBTI test - Introverted, Sensing, Feeling, Perceiving), I realized this would only be a sustainable career path for at most a year before I got antsy and wanted to do something more creative and ""hands-on"". Thus, the rapid scramble for major ideas.

So far, I've got it honed down to interior design, exercise science, and nutrition - these three engage some of my biggest interests, and I would undoubtedly be happy pursuing any one of these fields. However, none of them are particularly known for being lucrative or reliable fields to pursue. Therefore, I just wanted to ask you all, based on my desire for a job that provides a creative outlet, a fair amount of autonomy and stability, and decent pay, which of these paths do you think would be the most beneficial?

isfp,"Hi, I seem to attract ISFP females alot, and I am attracted to them as well, but the thing is, it's hard to get the conversation going. Everytime I meet an ISFP at a party or social setting, it's like oil and fire, I can feel this fire growing inside both of us, but since I don't want to come out as too eager, I do the usual small talk, which usually backfires. You guys literally stare the shit out of me and not say a single word, but your body language and smile tells me you are very interested in me, but I don't know how to get it going in a normal sense. I've slept with ISFP girls before, but it was when we were both high out of our minds either from alcohol or other drugs, and the next morning the same thing happens where the conversation gets kind of frozen and stalemate, and we both end up thinking we made a mistake. ISFP seem to see me as who I am (I look strong and unrelenting, but ISFP sees my soft side) I don't tell my friends that I like dogs, or that I am interested in art and dancing, or that I am secretly a closet nerd, but without a word, ISFP knows that I am that kind of person inside, but the only time I actually open up is when I'm incredibly drunk, which is when the magic happens between me and ISFP.

So the question is, Is it better for me to completely open up about who I am to an ISFP at first date? I never done it sober, but I would think it would scare them off since no one actually opens up at first few dates (maybe just me). Every type except ISFP, I can follow a routine and get them to like me without opening up. If there is a routine that an ISFP likes, would you guys care to tell me? If not, is taking off my mask and opening up my soft side the only way to get you guys to open up? Me opening up my soft side is equivalent to me kneeling to someone, and my conclusion was that you guys know that. 

If there is a right way to approach ISFP in general, let me know. One of my best friend is an ISFP, and tells me to be straight up and soft, but not really sure what that means and that's the only advice he'll ever give me.",1508789712

Then I noticed the way the early morning light was coming through my window and curtains, and the type of shadow that it cast on the wall. I felt really uneasy and I realized that for some reason that cold blue light and the shadows on the wall made me feel something very dark and painful. I don't know why but it made think of a girl who had a hard life, suffered a lot, and then committed suicide. This isn't a real girl by the way, the light and shadows just made this story pop into my head. It really made me sad though, I teared up a little thinking about it. I really felt attached to this made up shadow girl so I kind of just lay there feeling gloomy for a while. Then I got up and made a tea and forgot about it.

I've recently come into a relationship with an INTJ who I found to be what seemed a polar opposite, and it really got me thinking about how I process information and problem solve as in ISFP. I often feel as though my mind is blank, and after reading about compatibility between INTJ and ISFP, many explained that we are too happy-go-lucky, fun beings who rarely use logic or reasoning when trying to problem solve. I often feel unintelligent (when with INTJ) and often keep quiet when debating, for I always see both sides to a problem, and also can't come to a side that I could sit and prove to be right, it never seems to be worth my energy. This all being said, I was wondering as an ISFP how you feel your brain works? Are there any tips or tricks anyone has to be more ""logical"" or change the way you think? To have more ""intelligent"" conversation, and how to form a strong opinion more often?

Example:

Today I had bought a train ticket to my hometown (I study in another city). Before I left, I recalled that my mother had asked me to bring her glasses and my little brother's coat that they forgot at my sister's place, which is located in another district of the same city.

 As I was leaving, I calculated the time that it would take me to take the forgotten things from my sister's place and from there, to the railway station. Well, it wasn't enough so I decided to change the ticket to another one that was 2 hours later (with a small fee). I went back home, ate a bit (I was hungry and I forgot to take some food with me.) I decided to take my time with it. 

When I was ready to leave the second time, I calculated the time again (with a navigator app, I find it pretty reliable), and I found that I wouldn't make it yet again (or I would miss with a few minutes). Then I realized, I could message my sister to ask her to bring the things to the railway station herself! Then it would save me considerable time that way and I wouldn't have to panic. So I did.

isfp,"I have a lot of fragmented thoughts that fly in different directions. They‚Äôre rarely narrative in structure‚Ä¶ which would flow like a journey towards an end goal.

I wish I knew why

One of my theories is that I‚Äôm bombarded with sensations which narrows my scope of attention. Sometimes I get so focused on the micro details of the situation that I lose sight of the bigger picture. A minute ago I spent about 30 seconds re writing the word ‚Äúthey‚Äôre‚Äù; something about the conjunction was bothering me. But merely the process of deleting and re-writing that sentence was almost just as captivating as the intention I had to begin writing this. 

It‚Äôs why I have such a hard time sticking to things long term. It‚Äôs so easy to get lost in the moment. 

Is it something I can control? Yeah, with a lot of effort. Do I wish I was different? I guess, but wishing that doesn‚Äôt change the reality. Am I just lacking a long term goal which is important to me? Perhaps, but I haven‚Äôt been able to construct a sustainable goal that extends far into the future. Or maybe my idea of a goal needs to be less objective and more subjective‚Ä¶

Because every time I conceptualize what I seriously want to have accomplished on my deathbed, it‚Äôs less about the accolades and more about the person I became throughout the process. 

I admire people not for their material achievements, but for their personality and values. How authentic was this person in expressing what they truly felt? Whether it was ‚Äúright or wrong‚Äù is less important than sloppily expressing your personal truths. Obviously we‚Äôre all constrained by the environment we‚Äôre in‚Ä¶ we sacrifice our authenticity to maintain order in the social realm. I wouldn‚Äôt joke around in a sexual way in my corporate job nor would I have an unfiltered laugh at a friend‚Äôs funeral for some selfish reason. 

But for some reason this personality trait: authenticity, or congruence, or alignment with thoughts and actions in a genuine way, is what I‚Äôm powerfully drawn to, both in myself and others. Again and again, it appears to be the highest virtue I strive for. And the more my attention is focused on authenticity, the more trivial other things become.  Petty insecurities like how others perceive me become completely subordinate to my pursuit of authentic expression.

It‚Äôs why I respect things like spirituality and religion. Though they‚Äôre not the only mechanisms of inducing a purpose filled life, they limit your focus of attention towards what‚Äôs the most important. I read a book about how the most happy people are the least focused on being happy, the successful companies aren‚Äôt the most focused on profit, and the most creative people don't force themselves to be creative. It‚Äôs as if these achievements and skills arise in an oblique way, indirect rather than direct. And yet these achievements are often percieved to be the result of deliberate systematic technique, it appears they arise as a mere side effect of something more important.

While this doesn‚Äôt extrapolate much about my original point, I think you can see how my thoughts become scattered. I go down vortex‚Äôs of thought‚Ä¶ building and building on an idea as the sensations captivate me through time. But maybe I can string an idea together‚Ä¶

I originally criticized myself for how shortsighted my attention and focus was. But what if that's a mere side effect of authenticity?

...Because how could authenticity be conceptualized in the future, when the very definition of authenticity is ACTING in alignment with your thoughts and feelings? One cannot ACT in the future. So by definition, my highest virtue requires immediate action to feedback whether I‚Äôm being authentic. So my own critique of being shortsighted and bombarded by emotions is perpetuated by my striving to act authentically in the moment. Perhaps, a more sophisticated goal would could be to be as congruent as possible for the longest amount of time; strive for the state of being authentic, and every material accolade and success would arise indirectly.

And that goal feels right to me.

For me, it would be [LP - Lost on You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3wJ1_1Zsg) (I know it has got like a fuckton of views, but hhey i didn't know about this song for so long)

PS : I think the best ones are those which when you listen to them, you are like ""ehh I dont know.."" but when you play it two more times you can't stop listening to them :-)

EDIT: no problem with playlists too, or even whole genres ! I mean, f.e Electro swing, It's great",1506274521

isfp,"Hey all! So I'm a recently self-discovered ISFP (have previously mistyped as INFJ - who would've thought we were so similar to them?) and love reading all these discussions with you cool people :)

Anyway, I'm currently lost on where to go workwise: just graduated high school as valedictorian (took lots of AP classes, spent lots of times with IN--'s who I identified with academically) and was going into college planning to study math/economics to become an actuary. As someone, like all of you, trying not to drown in this increasingly STEM-oriented world, I feel like this is the smartest way to a stable income.

But like... as an ISFP, I keep feeling like that's not what life is really about. You know? Midway through senior year I became really interested in drag and female stage performers, and have subconsciously developed a really strong passion to pursue drag/art. It would be wholly fulfilling, let me express all of my creativity, and I know there wouldn't be one day that went by that I regretted choosing my path. However, there's just such a great risk associated with choosing this route - and a huge opportunity cost as well, giving up a STEM college education and basically betting my whole life on whether or not people like me enough as a performer. It's like I'm choosing between low risk-low return and high risk-high return at this point.

What do you all think? I'm so freaking sorry this text was so long, but finally having a group of like-minded people to relate to is liberating and any feedback you all have is greatly appreciated. &lt;3",1505701832

When I feel this way I'll start using my imagination and either draw up emotions and memories from past relationships or make them up myself. This will slowly lead to me getting horny, ""fixing"" that urge, and then completely shutting off thinking to myself ""why did I do that?"". Maybe it's just the fact that I'm 20 years old and all my past relationships have been less wholesome and more horny all around. This all just leads me to think ""was that all I'm good for? Satisfying myself and then completely shutting down? Not caring about the person I'm close with? Was it all for me?"" I'm not sure. I guess I just haven't met to right person yet to challenge my need for sexual contact. I wonder if my loneliness is the natural side of me, seeking love and true companionship; while the hormone prone pubic me turns that loneliness into lust, sexual need, and eventually anger.

isfp,"Thoughts about Si, Se, Ni and Ne, context, cross-context, worldview, and possibilities

* Si and Se deal with real experiences directly.
* Ni and Ne deal with patterns and connections.
* Si and Ni are concerned with worldview.
* Se and Ne are concerned with possibilities.

Ni/Se and Si/Ne work together as pairs:

* Ni/Se operate within one context at a time. Se usually focuses on the present context, but Ni can mentally shift the context in space/time so Se can have a look at it.
* Si/Ne are cross-contextual. So Si builds up insights over time, and Ne uses it as a springboard to find parallels between situations, objects, ideas, anything.

Therefore:

* Ni builds its worldview by looking at patterns and connections within a single context at a time.
* Si builds its worldview by looking at real experiences across contexts.
* Se finds possibilities by looking at real experiences in the current context.
* Ne finds possibilities by looking at patterns and connections across contexts.

&amp;nbsp;

**Label**

Add the possibility of free labels. For example, freedom of choice your type, or your type and enneagram, also, being able to choose the color of the label.

&amp;nbsp;

**Creating post**

When you want to create a post, you need to go and click the button of ""Submit a new a link"", so then you need to go and click ""Text"" to be able to write a post. It would be great to make it simpler and create a button of ""Submit text"" next to the other.

&amp;nbsp;

**A background**

For example, this: https://www.reddit.com/r/ENFP/

ENFP's have a beautiful background, is spacious and natural. It would be great to propose some backgrounds and then to vote for one in this sub. I though in something warm, live, bright and colorful because that's the feeling that gives me the ISFP.

&amp;nbsp;

**Title in posts**

When you write a title, all the initials are capital letters, which can confuse.

&amp;nbsp;

**Downvotes**

Fortunatelly, this is a sub with a lot of friendly people. I feel really understood and accompanied. But anyway, it would be amazing if we create a warning when we put the mouse on the downvote arrow. For example: ""Remember, downvote is only for aggressive comments, not to express disagreement"".

&amp;nbsp;

**Upvotes**

Also, a few words to the Upvote arrow, like, ""thanks for your vote"" or something, in order to promote amiability.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

**Any other idea? Want to propose a background? Share it!**

What do you think about it? please leave your coment and help us promote this post with other ISFPs!

isfp,"**1) How likely are you to play mind games if your crush was engaging in such an activity?**

Hypothetical example that is totally hypothetical - so most ISFPs are notoriously bad at texting right? Once upon a time, ISFP and notISFP text back and forth frequently. However, things happened. 3 days ago, notISFP texts ISFP. ISFP takes 1 hour to respond to notISFP. notISFP in return takes 9 hours to get back to ISFP. ISFP then takes 16 hours to get back to her. And the intervals keep dragging. ISFP isn't even busy, he deliberately ignores until *x* amount of hours has passed before replying.

**2) Is it normal for you to experience infatuation in frequent, but fleeting moments? (With different people)**

**3) Do you get jealous? If yes, how do you deal with the jealousy?**

**4) Are mental connections with your partner important? Or is 'doing fun things' enough to sustain a relationship?**

Another hypothetical example that is totally hypothetical - notISFP and ISFP hang out quite frequently. However, notISFP constantly fears the day she would run out of conversation topics with ISFP. Because notISFP and ISFP are very different people. notISFP can tell that there is NO MENTAL CONNECTION. However, due to ISFP's unique ability to exude calmness and carefree-ness, notISFP cannot tell if ISFP is affected by the lack of a mental connection. notISFP feels exhausted after spending time with ISFP because she has to be bubbly and altruistic to get along with ISFP. This is not a cry for help this is just a hypothetical situation. ~~help me please oh god idk what to do~~

**5) Not too sure how Fi-dom works. Are you guys *conscious* about what you want?**

Yet another hypothetical example - ISFP tells everyone that he likes some girl let's call her Mary. ISFP says he likes her because she's 'shy' and 'submissive' AKA his type of girl. ISFP is currently in the process of courting Mary. He gushes about Mary to notISFP. His gushings sound like, ""I think I'm in LOVE, she likes outdoorsy stuff. We have so much in common. She also likes snow. I like snow too. Hehe. Now she's telling me how she's always wanted to visit Greece. I too want to visit Greece!""

I'm studying to be an art teacher. I can see myself as a teacher, but I feel that life is something more. Also, I'm working in a bar, like the typical 23 years old guy.

I have no particular skills. I have no animals, no children, no girlfriend. Nothing really depends on me, nobody is going to lose anything if I change my life for another. Many people found me nice, others a fool. I could say I have one or two real friends. But I feel that there is something missing in my life. **I feel I have** to try to make my dreams come true.

&amp;nbsp;

I imagine myself dying of old, and remembering my life: *Always busy making money, studying, getting a girlfriend, a dog, a car... waiting for something to get better, but never being able of doing nothing more than saving money, studying, getting a girlfriend, waiting for life to get better.*

&amp;nbsp;

And I imagine myself dying young, and remembering my life: *I did what I wanted; I lived according to my deepest truth. Even if I haven't succeeded it is better than not having tried. The real success is to have done what is possible to reach my dream.*

I'll continue half functioning, I'll get a girlfriend. When I wanted to remember my life again, I'll be 40 years old half good father and husband. Maybe died at age of 73 years. Not much contribution to the world. Not much fun taken of my life. Always there, waiting for more free time, always waiting for something to get better.

I'm 99% sure my best friend is an ISFP. He's one of the most amazing people I've ever met, but we've been having a really rough go at things the last few years.

I didn't judge him for them, but my anxiety is horrible and so the things he did would cause me to want to throw up all the time. They still do. I felt more like he didn't care that he was causing me so much anguish - when I told him numerous times I just didn't want to know.

Anyway, as an ENTP the only thing I knew to do was distance myself a bit - but per usual, that has backfired and now he is distancing himself from me. 

I really love him and only want the best for him. I've tried to communicate a million times that it's me, not him. That my anxiety gets the best of me, but that I'd also hope that he does the right thing and is respectful of everyone.

He's very impulsive, would skip classes to do random stuff. But he 'studies' for long periods of time. (Lots of zoning out though) Also gets quite mediocre grades. Words like fickle, restless and unfocused can all be used to describe him. 

From what I have gathered, he falls for girls easily. And gets over them in a very short time. He said he's submissive in nature, but he likes... being the more dominant one in relationships, that's why he likes shy females?

I'm ENTP, and I'm not sure if he feels the same way, but our conversations feel insubstantial. At least the online ones. It's easier to talk to him face-to-face. He's very open to my weirdness and he gets my dark humour. But still insubstantial. We used to text everyday, but it felt very exhausting on my end because we are very different people and I felt like I constantly had to act bubbly and nice when we text. Otherwise he would feel uncomfortable.

He's also very averse to conflict and drama. If he senses conflict he would try his best to *not* get involved.

He's also a very nice person. He can't stand the idea of someone disliking him, so he tries his best to be nice to everyone. I don't think he engages in any form of art-making, song-writing, or poetry-composing. But he has this hidden depth. When prodded, he can and will discuss functioning parallels between his friends, motives of his counterparts etc. etc. He uses big words too.

isfp,"I'm seeing this ISFP. He approached me online first and was very interested in me. We got close really fast. He mentioned something the first night I saw him saying, you won't leave me will you? It's just like heart wrenching to hear it in my head now. I think someone hooked up with him and he fell for them hard and they left.

Some background: he moved to LA from NY over a year ago. Why I don't know. He hasn't seen any girls since then. As an SP that seems very strange. Especially since he *says* he goes to bars with his friends when he isn't working (he never wants to go to bars when I suggest it). He's very good at telling me what he DOESN'T like. He is definitely a 6w7 sx/sp. I can't find anything out about him. He will just rebel against everything I tell him to do for fun. Even sending a picture of his face. He doesn't like to go places but insists he isn't a homebody. So far I've seen him twice and we Netflix and chilled at his place both times. I've asked him what he plans to do with this ""girlfriend"" of his and what he wants and he says he doesn't know what he wants. Which I reiterated back to him.

Lately my former friend intervened and tried to tear our relationship apart. I blocked him on all media and my phone and will never talk to him again. I apologized sincerely to the ISFP. It was this guy trying to provoke him saying he'd like, videotape me doing shit and stuff and sending provocative pictures. So I think ISFP is scared of losing me to someone else. He lives an hour away and can't see me much because of his job so he can't know what I'm doing. This disaster happened on Sunday by the way and it is now Wednesday.

Do you guys relate to this? Can you explain it? What to do? I've texted him something once a day since Wednesday. He reads and doesn't reply. I'm really trying to connect to his emotions by being as open as I can with mine and honest and I never do that. I just sent him a huge playlist I've been working on for the past few days. It's several hours long. I'm sending him one more long ass text saying I don't know what else to do, you won't open up to me, I think you might have trust issues and you're pushing me away, I'll keep talking to you until you stop bugging me... before I just stop talking to him. I sent one text yesterday saying if he doesn't like me just tell me to leave and I'm gone forever but I'm not gonna leave him otherwise. He read and didn't reply an hour later so at least he doesn't want me to leave. A couple people have suggested he's playing games but that doesn't feel right to me.

I dunno. I just feel like if I left it would really fuck this dude up. He is super scared of disloyalty is my impression. He literally won't be vulnerable with me. He physically holds himself back. But he wants me to be vulnerable. I just don't feel like I can cut him out something tells me. I said I'd keep inviting him to stuff and we can even be friends until he's ready.",1502339653
isfp,"I'm INFP. About a month ago I began chatting with an ISFP guy online, and we ended up chatting for about 2 weeks. The reason it went on for so long was because it was difficult to try to get him to arrange a time to come and see me. But I really enjoyed chatting with him, he was so funny and sweet and would sometimes make me cry with laughter. We both seemed very interested in the same kind of thing from a relationship, where we both wanted to experience something serious since we were both tired of the promiscuity that is rife in the gay community. And he seemed really into me, where he would initiate the conversation every single day.

Then we finally agreed a day. He even told me what train he was going to get. But then on the day we were supposed to meet he just stopped replying altogether. After a few days of hearing nothing from him I decided to delete him on all social media.

A month later I saw him on tinder and I swiped left just out of intrigue. We matched. He then wrote to me on tinder and said he was sorry and said that he liked me so much that he got really nervous and just stopped responding. Then he did the same thing where he was writing to me a lot and I got reminded of how much I enjoyed speaking with him, so I eventually agreed to meet him.

This time we did actually meet. I went to his neighbourhood and we went to a cafe together. Afterwards we went swimming in a lake (we had agreed upon this beforehand so we both brought swimming trunks). We subsequently sat behind a rock in our swimming trunks and chatted and made out. I really enjoyed the day. I was possibly slightly more reserved than I might otherwise have been because I was apprehensive about letting myself be too swept away by him in case he might just ignore me again. But now after we met, he's gone completely cold again. He hasn't stopped replying to me altogether but it takes him about a day to reply to my messages, whereas before he would often reply almost instantly.

I don't know what to do or think about him. I really liked him - thought he was gorgeous, kind, funny. But he just seems to be making things very difficult.

(Another note: He took a photo of me when I came out the bathroom which I also thought was a bit peculiar.)",1502279955

isfp,"Hey buddies and buddettes,

I'm an ISFP, a sensitive little baby teddy bear, 26/f, but I loooove to go out and drink, mingle, walk through the city and hit a few bars, hear the loud music, maybe dance a little, and yell over it all to be heard... until making my way home long after midnight. Is this unusual for an isfp?  

I know we're super introverted and timid and shy for the most part, but I think that's why I get such a thrill out of experiencing the opposite. It's nice to go out, have a couple drinks, and become the social person I always wanted to be. I'm addicted to it. Maybe I'm over compensating for a lifetime of social anxiety and a very strict conservative upbringing. Or maybe I'm just overcoming boredom :p

Do you have intense social cravings in spite of your shyness? Or are you happier to stay home in your comfort zone? Also, I want you all to answer EVEN if someone said something similar already, as I know we ISFPs often feel our input is not needed (we are the most likely to write out a reply, then delete without posting).",1502133027
isfp,"**Is there anything that may affect the way you answer the questions? For example, a stressful time, mental illness, medications, special life circumstances? Other useful information includes sex, age, and current state of mind.**

Female, 22, currently relaxed.

**Describe yourself as a person if you were to introduce yourself to someone else like in a cover letter. What kind of person are you and why?**

I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôd say in an actual cover letter if I were introducing myself, so I‚Äôm just going to describe myself. I‚Äôm easygoing, really relaxed most of the time, hardly get stressed or worried about things, and I love to enjoy life. I‚Äôm pretty lazy and I‚Äôm hard to motivate. Even if I want to do something like lose weight, it‚Äôs hard for me to actually get motivated and dedicate time and effort into losing weight, partially because I really love food. I don‚Äôt have life goals, I have no idea what I want to do in the future, and I‚Äôm not an ambitious person. I‚Äôm easy to get along with, can converse about many topics so I guess I‚Äôm pretty open-minded, and I like to keep things peaceful. Because I‚Äôm all about peace and comfort, I don‚Äôt like doing things out of my comfort zone and I‚Äôm very conflict-averse. I‚Äôm accommodating, have a hard time making any of my own decisions or taking initiative, and I‚Äôm an agreeable person. I typically either have strong opinions or no opinion at all (or not really). I‚Äôm extremely materialistic, have a hard time saving money, and I‚Äôm interested in anything aesthetically pleasing including fashion or anything beauty related, photography, and interior design. I‚Äôm not a risk taker, like stability and security, and have a good memory for detail. I‚Äôm ethical, reserved, shy, and it‚Äôs hard for me to get close to people and feel comfortable with them to the point where I‚Äôd open up or express my feelings to them. I‚Äôm pretty bad at dealing with people who are being emotional to me. I‚Äôm kind of a follower as opposed to a leader and I‚Äôm very passive and easily taken advantage of. 

**What were you like as a child? Think about how you were in school, with friends, and at home with your family.**

As a child, I was friendly and active; I liked playing sports as a child, but now I‚Äôm very physically inactive. In the classroom, I was a good student, but I was also quiet and hardly ever participated. A lot of my friends in school enjoyed bullying me, not because they thought something was wrong with me, but because they just thought it was fun to hit me or pick on me since I never did anything back to them and never spoke up for myself. At home with my family, I was helpful; I used to help my mom with chores a lot, and she said that I was fast with my hands, but that I‚Äôm now too slow. When I was still in elementary, I enjoyed going outside and traveling to random places with my siblings even though we had no idea where we were going. I wasn‚Äôt that obedient to my parents at home. I still did unsafe activities even though I was told not to, such as go out into the streets alone. 

**What kind of person would you LIKE to be? Why? What kind of person would you NOT want to be? Why?**

I‚Äôd like to be someone who‚Äôs kind, but able to stand up for themselves and speak up when necessary because I admire people like this. I also want to be someone who has their future envisioned and who are passionate about things because I‚Äôm not a passionate person and I have no future dream. I want to be someone who‚Äôs artistic and good at writing because even though my writing skills aren‚Äôt bad, I want to be even better. I also want to know how to draw really well. I want to be someone who has their shit together/planned out, and is achieving enough to actually go after what they want because those people work hard and have the motivation that I lack. 

I don‚Äôt want to be someone who‚Äôs unethical and selfish because I don‚Äôt like those kind of people. Those people who go after what they want at any means necessary without being concerned about how it‚Äôll affect other people annoy me. I don‚Äôt want to be someone who‚Äôs only concerned about money. I wouldn‚Äôt want to be someone who‚Äôs excessively pessimistic, worrying about things that could go wrong, and complaining all the time because they drain my energy and annoy me. I also don‚Äôt want someone who‚Äôs rude and lacks manner or someone who‚Äôs aggressive, competitive, and controlling. 

**Do you think there are any differences to how you described yourself and how people actually perceive you? How do you think others would describe you? If there are any discrepancies between these two that are you are aware of; do you know why exactly that is?**

For the most part, I believe the way I described myself is how people perceive me. One discrepancy is that people see me as lazier than I actually am because most of my friends are friends I made back in high school, and that was when I was so lazy to the point where it was too much. In high school, I didn‚Äôt care about my grades at all and I all I did was enjoy life and disregard my responsibilities like homework and studying. I‚Äôm a lot less lazy than I once was before. People also underestimate my intellect; a lot of my friends think I‚Äôm a bit dumb, but I‚Äôm actually not. Others would describe me as chill, funny, a spender, open-minded, shy, a pushover, slow-paced, too agreeable, nice, helpful, and friendly. They would also describe me as a homebody, lazy, easily irritated, indecisive, and two-faced. A long time ago, many people thought I was a big mouth who liked to gossip too much.

**What in life do you find to be of importance? Why?**

I believe it‚Äôs important to be happy and stress-free in life. I don‚Äôt think people should overwork themselves too much or expect too much out of life just in case they end up struggling to meet those expectations and as a result, get stressed out and/or unhappy. I believe it‚Äôs important to just do what makes you happy otherwise you‚Äôll live a life you won‚Äôt really like, and you might end up regretting the path you took because you aren‚Äôt living life how you prefer to live it. To me, happiness is more important than things like money or status. I also believe it‚Äôs important to treat others how you want to be treated, and to not deceive people.

**How do you react to new situations in your life? Can you describe an event in your life where you were in an unknown situation? How did you deal with it?**

I don‚Äôt adapt to change as quickly or easily as I‚Äôd like to. I feel like it might be because I‚Äôve become so comfortable and situated in a situation I‚Äôm already used to, and that makes me more hesitant to change. That along with not knowing what to expect. If the new situation isn‚Äôt anything too big (traveling, trying a new activity, etc) I‚Äôm fine with it for the most part. However it‚Äôs kind of bad if it‚Äôs something like a new job or anything that involves waiting to know what the outcome will be (good or bad). I was put in an unknown situation when I started working a completely different job, and I disliked not knowing how I‚Äôd end up performing after training, which was hard for me. Because of that, I quit during training. Another situation was when my family and I moved into a new house. For that, I reacted and adapted pretty well. I did prefer my old home, but it was easy for me to get used to living in the new house. 

**Please describe yourself when you are in a stressful situation. How do you act and why?**

When I‚Äôm stressed, I‚Äôm more easily irritated and prefer others to not bother me. Besides that, I don‚Äôt really know because I don‚Äôt catch myself stressed out that often. I guess I‚Äôm also more impulsive and irrational when I‚Äôm stressed out, and want to make hasty choices without thinking clearly first. 

**Describe your relationship to socialization. How do you perceive one-on-one interaction? How do you perceive group interaction?**

I‚Äôm okay with socializing if it isn‚Äôt for too long because if it‚Äôs too long, I start to get tired. One on one interactions are nice if I‚Äôm comfortable with the person and they‚Äôre easy to talk to, but if not then I prefer group interaction. Actually just in general, I prefer group interaction because I can listen more than speak whereas in a one to one interaction, it‚Äôs always a back and forth exchange between me and the other person. If I‚Äôm not involved in the interaction though, I find one on one interactions more appealing because they seem more intimate and from an outside perspective, it would seem like the two people have a really strong connection. However for me personally, I‚Äôd rather be involved in a group interaction. 

**Describe your relationship to society. What are the elements of it you hold important or unimportant (e.g. social norms, values, customs, traditions)? How do you see people as a whole?**

I'd say that most social norms, values, customs, and traditions are okay, but I don't care whether or not they should be kept or followed. However there are some social norms and etc that I don't particularly agree with. I don't have much of an opinion on people as a whole. I guess some people are cool whereas some people are annoying. One thing I always think is that people should stop trying so hard to be who they aren't to the point where they'd do something like act rude to others just because their friends are like that. I feel like many people make things complicated when they don't have to be. Other than all of that, I actually don't pay that much attention to society or anything.


**Describe your relationship to authority. How do you perceive authority? What does it mean to you, and how do you deal with it?**

I don‚Äôt really like authority because many people abuse the power they have. I also dislike authority because I feel like people should treat everybody equally, so I don‚Äôt find things like authority, hierarchy, and power appealing. Even if I was in a position of power, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd want to exercise it. In terms of my relationship, I listen to those in authority even if I don‚Äôt want to just in case something bad happens to me if I don‚Äôt obey them. 

Describe your relationship to order and chaos. What do order and chaos mean to you? How do they manifest in your daily life?

I don‚Äôt have much of an opinion on order, but I dislike chaos because I like having at least a little bit of control over my situation just so things don‚Äôt go out of hand and turn super chaotic, which would be hard for me to deal with.
 
**What is it that you fear in life? Why? How does this fear manifest to you both in how you think and how you act?**

I don‚Äôt have any strong fears, but I guess I would say that I fear conflict because it‚Äôs hard for me to deal with and because I don‚Äôt want to make enemies with anyone since it would feel so awkward if I have to see them, knowing that we got into some issues and dislike each other. It‚Äôs also just something that makes me uncomfortable. This manifests in how I think and act in that I fear conflict to the point of not standing up for myself even for the simplest things ever, and I can‚Äôt even speak up when I know it‚Äôs necessary to. Other than that, I also fear public speaking because I hate attention and feeling like people are possibly judging me for either how I look/sound or how my presentation is. 

**What is it that you desire in life? What do you strive to achieve? Why? Where do you think these drives and desires stem from or are inspired by?**

I desire a happy, relaxed life as well as my ideal appearance. I desire all the designer items on my wishlist. I also desire stability and financial security. I don‚Äôt know what I strive to achieve lol.

**What activities energize you most? What activities drain you most? Why?**

The activities that energize me most include listening to music, watching shows and movies, eating good food, being on the computer, and relaxing at home. The activities that drain me the most include being out for too long, being in crowded areas, listening to someone talk excessively without giving me a turn to reply, and anything too physically active. 

**Finally, is there something else you find to be of importance you want to add about yourself you think might be of relevance when helping to type you?**

- My enneagram is 9w1 SP, tritype 269 I think (not in that order). 
- My temperament is phlegmatic and sanguine
- I‚Äôm not nice or helpful because I care about other people or want them to be happy, but because I either feel obligated to help, want to avoid conflict/haters, or feel like I should be doing something (like holding the door for others, etc) because it‚Äôs the right thing to do. 
- I‚Äôm good at reading other people‚Äôs motives and usually pick up vibes about their character when first meeting them. 
- I dress for appearance, not for comfort
- I‚Äôve been through a lot of phases in life such as a preppy phase, a gothic phase, a tomboy phase, a scene phase, and stuff like that when I was in my teen years.

isfp,"hi everyone, i'm an isfp (i think). i don't feel as if online descriptions entirely of isfp match me; but the functions do very well and so that's what i'm going by! anyways, to the point:
i'm still young, but many times over the years i have been called either serious or too serious. at first i took it as a compliment, being serious can be a good thing. but then i realized some people don't think i can be fun, or i can't take a joke because they think i'm serious all the time. maybe that's all in my head though. but i hate it. i think some of it might have to do with my face/voice not showing a lot of emotion or people not catching onto it. 
i always enjoy a good laugh even though i may not make jokes or gags myself. i love having fun, i may be much more reserved than others though. but what i do know is that i'm in the moment, enjoying every single thing that is happening around me. it's not like i'm just sitting there not enjoying myself. and that's why i hate being called serious. i feel like people don't see the real me. i mean, that's fine but that's not really who i am inside!!! i yearn to have fun in actuality. that was just a side point...
and i think i may come off as serious maybe because when people are talking to me i really think about what they are saying/doing and immersing myself in the conversation??? i don't really know.
it's almost as if people either see me as not having any worries so they don't bother being serious with me or they think i'm not fun enough. it goes both ways. and it kinda sucks.

isfp,"In the past I've dated an ISTP and I'm currently dating an ESTP. 

ISTP: Relationship itself was okay and we lived together for a while. However, he was very fleeting and broke up with me several times. He couldn't decide if he wanted to be with me or not and it tore me apart. Each time he'd say something like ""we're just not compatible"" and stuff like that. We could both comfortably enjoy alone time and enjoyed doing stuff together like games and anime. He was also a closed book which was very frustrating. It was like a game to try and get answers out of him. He was  overly confident and cocky which was a huge turnoff. Also pretty insensitive and couldn't empathize with people. 

ESTP: Very fun and exciting relationship. He's a total open book and a hilarious person. He brings me out of my comfort zone. I never thought I could date an extrovert but he doesn't talk all the time and we can enjoy some quiet moments together. Sometimes we run out of things to talk about though. I like that we can just chill together and on the weekends be like ""Hey, wanna go to this event?"" ""Sure."" Sometimes he can be insensitive, but I know he cares about me so I let that slide. We're in an open relationship (he wanted one) because we're apart a lot of the time since he has to travel for work. He doesn't plan much for the future and doesn't really talk about serious topics which can be frustrating. He's not a huge fan of animals either which is hard for me. :(

How about you fellow ISFPs?",1501343420
isfp,"I did the personality test on that 16personalities website (since it appeared the most attractive/professional) and tested as ISFP(-T) 4 separate times over the course of a week. I'm new at this but I decided to reach out to the inter-webs since I haven't tried this method yet, here goes nothing.


I've been in a little bit of a (well kinda big) rut recently since entering the university system last year, I still have no idea what I want to do although I definitely know what I don't or wouldn't like to do in the future (e.g. definitely not mechanical engineering or the sciences). I used to be interested in film (fueled by my enjoyment from making YouTube videos for fun) but that kind of died off, just like my interest for business studies/commerce. I've been attempting programming during my time in university, but recently that has been dwindling too. It's not like I am failing horribly at those subjects, in fact i'd say i'm doing decently; it's just that I find it really hard to justify doing something if I don't enjoy it (for an extended period of time). I started to notice and acknowledge that my work ethic revolves around random bursts of high energy and motivation whenever I find something I am genuinely interested in whether it be a subject, a hobby or even something as minuscule as shooting a basketball, I would literally dedicate my entire life towards that activity and become the most efficient and hard-working person that I personally know of. But as a result, if nothing ignites me or interests me in the first place, I procrastinate (a lot), lose motivation and as of recently, start questioning whether I made the right choice in choosing media as my major. I am jealous that many of my friends found their place at their unis and seem to be excelling in their fields and healthily developing as an individual, finding internships and what-not, getting fit and healthy, making money etc. And here I am again, wondering what went so wrong.


Why can't I handle stress and/or bite the bullet like my friends? Why do I mentally and physically crumble under (the smallest amounts of) stress? Why do I procrastinate so much even though I know that I can physically do a certain task?  Why am I always unsatisfied and anxious? Those are probably some of the questions I google every night before I worry myself to sleep (am I even an ISFP?). It's just so depressing thinking about this stuff but I feel if I were to suppress these feelings, they would probably creep up on me in the future. I tried sharing with friends and family, but they don't seem to fully understand (comprehend), maybe because I am bad at explaining what's going on inside my head, or they're not taking me seriously. Every time I try to explain the struggle i'm going through (especially to elders) I get the ""you're not in the workforce yet, so just get good grades"" talk. I understand that they might have gone through the college experience and found some secure 9-5 job that pays good money, but that doesn't mean I should subject myself to that same path (of torture) doing something I have no interest in, come out working some random job which I will hate for the next 20 years only to say ""I hate myself"". 


Speaking of hate, I sometimes hate how emotionally sensitive/weak I am. Maybe I can attribute that to my weak strength (relative to the world) so I can't exactly put up a fight, nor do I want to since I know I'll lose. Or my mental capabilities, especially the ability (inability in this case) to keep up my side of a verbal argument, it seems to always get to a point where I start realizing where I might be wrong and then I implode; so I feel that unless I am 100% correct I cannot win (I usually lose in those arguments too since the other person tends to arrogantly think they are correct anyway). I don't exactly have high self-esteem nor the willpower to just will it to existence like my brother did. Don't get me wrong, I do have willpower, but it just comes and goes at the worst of times; I'd go out my way to spend time with a friend if they are in need, but I just can't get started on that essay.


I've been told many times that I view things too much in black and white, ones and zeroes, and that I take things way too seriously/personally (even social interaction), but habits are hard to break right? I have no idea what the solution is, I doubt it can be found through a simple google search. I have tried taking things less seriously and become more lenient to halfway points (not winning 100% of the way, at least I put in effort sort of thing), but it seems during moments of high stress (work or play) I throw all that out the window whenever things are going south and it's back to square one. It almost feels like I let my guard down and as a result I let the result slip. A common example would be: while I am playing games I relax a little and enjoy the game with a few friends. Then some random player on my team says that I suck (usually after a round loss); the casual match then becomes some personal mission for me to do everything I can to prove him/her wrong so I can rub it in their face later (not verbally of course). This puts a lot of stress on something that is meant to be a relaxing activity. The thing is, I know that it's not a healthy thing to do, but I do it impulsively (explosively) and usually I can't control it although I am aware of my actions. It usually ends badly as I tend to set impossible expectations for myself but still be disappointed if I don't reach them. 


I probably said enough, I could go on for ages but I doubt fellow redditors would want to read such a long post (especially if it's a rant). I don't really expect much from this post, nor do I know what response I want to see (just like how I don't know what I expect my family or friends to say after hearing my rants), but at least I got it out.",1501178802

isfp,"I invested wisely when I was younger and saved up a lot of money from my job straight out of college. As a ""starving artist"" type, I quit my job because I felt 40 hours a week was just too much. Wake up early tired as fuck, commute on a ghetto bus for almost an hour, go to work, talk to people through messenger only, commute back on a bus, walk my dog, cook dinner and relax, by then I have maybe an hour to do my hobbies, but I usually go to the gym since it's pretty much necessary. What the fuck? I can't believe this is how people live. On weekends I usually have to grocery shop, get my car fixed, take my dog to the vet, go to the gym, or have a social life for a friday/saturday night. By then, I STILL have no time for my hobbies.

I want to learn how to skateboard, make music, play more instruments, volunteer, travel, build my own house eventually, start my own business, meet new people, join gymnastics, lift, join an orchestra, learn to cook better, make funny videos for Youtube. Etc etc etc.

So, I quit my job. I have enough money to live a year or two without working. Believe it or not, I STILL don't have enough time to do all this!! It's the most frustrating thing in the world. I recently graduated with my Bachelor's degree last month, so I thought okay, this will free some time up, but no, there's always SOMETHING. 

My typical day is wake up, shower, walk my dog, go to the gym, by then it's time to make some food, so I do that and dick around on Reddit for a while. Then either my friends want to hang out or I go to the skatepark or play piano, then it's time for dinner. I eat and catch up on Youtube subscriptions. I go to the gym. Dog needs another walk. By now it's about midnight, day is done. It NEVER seems like enough time! I want to do everything. This is what a day looks like when nothing urgent comes up, such as car needs to go to the shop or friend is having a panic attack or sister wants to call and catch up for a couple hours.

isfp,"I'm an ENTJ,
Ok let me try and make a long story concise here...:

Background:
One of my closest and most long-time friends is an ISFP, we grew up together and were like brothers. A few years ago he got into a really bad downward spiral driven by an adderall (prescription amphetamine) abuse problem. He seemed to be struggling with a lot of paranoid and delusional thoughts and he quit college, work, family and moved into a room in his GF's family's house and played ""call of duty"" all day for two years. He had surrounded himself with enablers and complacent people.
I moved back from college to find him in this state and, over a period of about a year and a half, slowly but quite forcefully pushed him to reenter society. In the process I got him a good job at my workplace and he has been adjusting, he's been normal-ish for about 1 year.
Although initially my goal was to rehabilitate him 100%, he seems to be permanently changed from the person he was before the ordeal, and I accept that now for the most part.

Now:
However, in the past 4 months or so, he has started to relapse into irrational and paranoid thinking, and this time the target is me. His belief is that I am ""talking gossip"" about him and that I constantly hound him for ""favors"". He will bend or twist any interactions or events to fit as evidence to reinforce this narrative. 

For example:
-Any time I ask him about something going on in his life (small talk), he gets extremely defensive. Believing I am trying to pry for gossip to tell others.
-If friends or acquaintances know something about his life, he will interpret that as evidence of my gossiping. (his memory is poor, and often times he was the one that told them, but he forgot).
-He will bring up a list of 2 small favors he helped me with 1-2 years ago and get really resentful about it. I have stopped asking for anything from him for a long time now. But I can't escape this resentment for these past favors.

On several occasions now, we've discussed in depth these thoughts and actions, and corroborated with mutual friends that his thinking seems unusual. Each time he seemed to mellow out and start to trust me for a few weeks, only to return back to the irrational thinking.
As it stands now, I've decided try to switch strategies and give him space instead. As a result our relationship is basically on a communications blackout for 2 months. However, since I got him a job at my workplace, I still have to interact with him and its very tense and uncomfortable.

I'm not sure if these issues are related to the ISFP type or if it's a sign of mental illness?

Can anyone relate? 
How can I escape from this zone of scapegoat/ enemy? 
Any advice is very much appreciated. Thanks everyone!

I feel like I'm acting on impulse all the time. I dont think before I speak or before I buy something or make decisions. Sometimes, it saves me time, effort and some concerns I don't need, but sometimes (lots of them) they also bring me bad consequences. For example, I realized I'm an impulsive liar. Not all the time, but in some situations where I feel pressured or just only on the bad consequences of telling the truth, I just lie. I know that lying will bring worse consequences in the future, but I do it out of impulse to avoid immediate conflict.

Well, that was one example of how my impulsivity is bringing bad consequences to my life right now, but there are many others. I just want to be more aware of what I say, what I think and what I feel, instead on living in autopilot while I hide in the back of my brain.

Do any of you experience the same thing?  Is it just me or is it an ISFP problem? 
And how to deal with it? I think therapy would help, but it's not a viable solution right now.

I just don't feel like I really know who I am enough to know exactly what content I should produce. 

To give you an idea of why I want to get started with YouTube, I love producing and editing videos. I don't think anything makes me feel more creatively stimulated since I'm not much of a drawing / painting type of creative haha. I also love the freedom that it would give me.

BUT despite all that I don't feel like I'm a person who is interesting enough / I'm having a lot of doubt about my abilities both in making videos and in finding a job / career path that interests me enough.

I personally love it now. I remember when I saw it back in 1999. I back then thought it was ""painfull to watch"" cause it brought up some wierd feelings i could not explain. I was then married to a woman I did not truly love and that did not share my intense feelings for life etc. I dont think she reacted to the movie at all really. She commented something I remember and never spoke of the movie again. But it stuck with me. I have always ""worshipped"" Nicole kidman after that movie...(along with the hot prostitute that died)

Then...a few years ago I mentioned the movie to my much younger GF. A woman I truly love and desire. She kinda liked it...i just showed her the ""sex clips"" and she liked it. She is very sexual and i guess that helps alot (my x-wife was not really sexual at all..just extremly smart).

Then....fast foreward to last night, Me and my GF even ""played out"" a litte bit of the movie ourself and it was pure magic. A magic for the senses I think I have never expereinced before. That wierd music in the background...and she playing the totally lost, submissive prostitute was absolutely sentational. She smiles a little bit tio much in the start and I think she was about to laugh....but she quickly and by my ""direction"" turned into being lost...and basically looked like she was on drugs.

I'm pretty much addicted to strong experiences (but never truly life threatening dangerous like parajumping etc) where I can use all of my senses 100% so this was a fantastic thing. She loved it aswell.

So I was thinking that the ISFP community might like Eyes wide shut ""themes""...or I might be wrong but the whole thing is just perfect I think:)

EDIT: Mind you! I do NOT share in the ""darker meaning"" of the film. I would never ever really want to experience the ""theme"" in real life and in person (I probably could have watched as a fly on the wall), but as a ""thill for the senses"" and for ""in the mind only role play"" its utterly perfect!

But recently, I've grown to fear that he is somehow compromising, because he doesn't ever say what he wants at all. He doesn't talk about his passions, he mostly doesn't talk about himself. If I asked him what he wanted to do he would just scratch his beard and smile while looking around. Heck, yesterday I tried to ask him what he wanted to do on the phone: 10 seconds of silence.

isfp,"Okay, so here go my lengthy night posts (apologies in advance, if it drags on a little, I shall try and keep is succinct).
ENTP female here. 

About a week ago, I met this girl busking (also another musician/ busker), who I am assuming to make things simpler is an ISFP.

She's very artsy, literally lives and breathes art, music, photography, film, etc. Anyway I struck up a conversation with her as I was curious as to where I was able to busk in that particular area. Initially I had no other intentions except to learn more about the ins and outs of busking in that area from a fellow busker, who seemed very friendly and approachable. 

Anyway I introduced myself, said I was a busker, she shook my hand and introduced herself, was very smiley and friendly (just her peaceful nature I suppose). I made sure it was okay if I busked further down, and she said it was and was grateful I asked. I went off and busked a bit further down. 
 As she passed me when she had packed up, she smiled, and mouthed that I was very good, and dropped in a dollar. Also as she turned the corner on the street, I saw her look at me for a bit longer and smile-- perhaps just her sort of wowed by me singing (not to be arrogant, but don't want to assume this is a sign of attraction). 

That night, I found her on Facebook, as I wanted to check out her music (she was busking on a hand pan, but is also a singer/ multi instrumentalist) I was also intrigued by her, hard to explain. I messaged her, saying it was nice to meet her. 
We struck up a conversation for a while, she said she thought I sounded so good, and she loved my voice.
We chatted about music for a while, the conversation flowed pretty well, and she kept asking me questions about me and my music. When she found out I was queer (well not straight) she seemed chuffed with herself cause apparently she'd picked up almost instantly that I was into girls haha. I asked why, and she said perhaps from my style (which she also said she loved) but also a vibe. 
 We continued to chat, she kept complimenting me and being what I would say friendly, perhaps borderline flirtatious, although i am god awful at picking up on those things, hence why I'm enquiring on this forum. We talked about our sexuality (we both feel we're more attracted to the person than gender), she asked me what my type was aha. We chatted about relationships, etc. 

I was in a relationship (undefined) at the time, however the girl was slowly detracting her affection and I knew it, was just coming to terms with the fact it was gonna end (I have now broken it off). 
We talked for a good few hours, she continued to keep the convo going, asking me questions about myself. Also her answers seemed quite thoughtful (typical of ISFP). We just seemed to click, like it seemed effortless chatting with her. We had some good laughs at stupid things (she has a rad sense of humour it turns out, very witty and sarcastic). 
.... 
We chatted the next night, into the morning, and we were in fits of laughter. I somehow had the idea of making a carrot into a clarinet/ flute, and she strongly encouraged this insane plan of mine, and she kept joking with me. She pushed me (teasingly) into sending her a video of me playing on this carrot instrument, and apparently it ""made her night""

We talked intermittently after that, we were both super busy with social events and music related activities. She continued to be quite fun and jokey (can't think of a better word) with me. I was  actually shocked at her blatant wit and her overt sarcasm. She also said to make sure I came and said hi if I was busking in the same spot as her any time. But again could just be her being friendly.

We stopped contacting each other as often over the past few days, because I was going through a tough time after ending things with this other girl, and she was super busy with gigs, and recording.  But we have had small chats here and there.

Do you think there is a possibility she could be interested? Or do you see this as purely her being friendly? She seems to respect me at least, and find me inspiring and interesting as an artist which is nice. But how do you differentiate the friendly from the more-than-friendly with ISFP's? You guys are a very mysterious and secretive bunch, it seems.
I wouldn't say I have a crush on her, but I am definitely fascinated by her- she's just so mystical, and there is something very intriguing and beautiful about her. She has this quiet confidence, like she knows who she is but doesn't feel the need to shout it, and is just comfortable with who she is. 

I know it was super long, thanks for your time!!!

isfp,"Hey, I'm not entirely sure if I use Ne-Si or Se-Ni. I will describe some of the things I do to give examples. 

I consider myself very dreamy. The daydreams I have are usually about random things that happen. They're not particularly related to the future/past. 

Another thing, I'm easily distracted but once I begin with something (homework for instance) I'm instantly focused. 

I'm also very lazy, It just feels like I don't have the energy for some things to do. A lot of people have made jokes about how lazy I look or about how slow my movements are. It just feels like I need some kind of stimulation for everything I do.

They say isfp's are better at practical and creative things and infp's are better at things as writing. I easily pick up practical skills like playing music instruments and drawing. But I'm also quite good at writing. With writing I mean, I'm good at writing articles and essays. When it comes to writing a story, I just can't make a chronological and fictional story. 

Another thing isfp's tend to do is expressing themselves. I don't know if that's me. Like I don't really dress myself different from others. I usually just like it the comfortable way. And as for drawing, cooking and other things, I don't do them unless it is asked from me. When I do such things, I do enjoy it but its not something I neeed to do regularly.

I really am picky about things. I have a strong meaning of what is good looking/bad looking. 

I'm also very indecisive. I always need help from others when making decisions. 

As for living in the moment, I'm sure I do that. I never picture myself in the future and I have no clue about what I'm going to do later in my life. I love to just do what I want, when I want it. Althought a lot of those things never come to action because I'm just not comfortable enough to do it. It only comes out when I'm with my family/friends.

I don't know if all the things I wrote about have anything to do with the cognitive functions. Soo if you need more info, just ask me questions..  I'm sorry if some things are badly written, my native language isn't English

isfp,"I'm an ISFP, obviously. That's why I'm here. I'm 24 with no degree and no idea what I want to do. Great, isn't it? Let me ask you this. When I take another personality/quiz/test, called StrengthsQuest, why do I get these as my top 5 strengths:

Deliberative
Empathy
Adaptability
Strategic
Responsibility

How on earth did I get this result as a person with no direction in life? There is in no way I am deliberate about my actions. Empathy maybe. Adaptability maybe. But strategic and responsible? I'm confused.",1494830501
isfp,"My biggest problem as a person is that I tend to keep most of my emotions locked away. It's gotten a lot better as I have matured and today I am a very outgoing and polite person but I still keep my strong feelings locked away. I tend to lockup especially when I am tired/frustrated and needing a break from dealing with other people (typically a introvert thing I believe). I had experienced large amounts of sadness and depression in my past due to parental problems. I went to therapy years ago but I never got over my feelings untill my life (through time) got over them for me. I've though about seeing another therapist but my rationale‚Äã tells me that I myself would be the only person able to understand. Whenever bad things happen to me or people say things to me that make me hot headed, I feel like my mind punishes me by recalling bad memories and forcing their emotions back on my body. I'll try to cope with the nuances of the day and sometimes I can mellow out but sometimes I can't hold in my emotions enough and I erupt. I start not thinking before I speak and I generally don't like my demeanor. Am I fucked up? Do I need help? I don't know.

isfp,"I don't have many friends that are women. Mainly because my brain is always on the motive of eventually dating the girl I'm friends with. Like I could see myself being really good friends with a woman but then I wouldn't see a point not to date her. It's to the point where if a woman strait up said to me that she wasn't interested in a relationship, I would simply loose interest and wouldn't be friends with her.

isfp,"I recently met this girl on tinder and after talking for about three days, we have a shit ton in common. Turns out she's a INFP. She's been great in convos and she isn't in the slightest a boring person. 

She just recently got out of a taxing relationship and she said that she wasn't looking to start a new relationship right away for a while. She says she would like to just do her own thing for a bit. 

I get very emotional when I'm lonely and especially when other people don't talk to me. I know she doesn't hate me, but my conscience says she does because that's just how my brain assumes when people don't talk to me. Its probably because I don't know her that well. I guess I just expect too much from people that I meet. 

Anyone else have these problems?",1493553698
isfp,[deleted],1493552704
isfp,"Seeing as how dead and forsaken this sub is and how I'm genuinely perplexed by this ISFP and need help, why not.

Long story short, a little more than a month ago I met this ISFP girl. I'm 99% certain she is ISFP, she fits all the stereotypes and all the things associated with ISFP behavior that I have scoured the entire internet including the farthest reaches for in true INTP fashion. She fits it to a T. Theoretically, INTP/ISFP is never supposed to work right from the start and is one of the harder pairs to bring together, but I believe that is bullshit and with the right respect, communication, and sacrifice from any two people, any mbti combination can make it work.

Since then, we've hung out every single weekend(already have plans for next weekend), and my feelings for her have blossomed. She's genuine, a great listener, puts me at ease, and her sense of the moment is amazing to me, probably because I live in my own head too much. I don't even care that she'd rather not listen to my intellectual banter and keep it to myself instead, I just focus on her strengths and appreciate what she brings to the table.

The problem is that I can't read her locked, heavily guarded closed book. It bothers me because she doesn't show any signs of interest, like at all. She is extremely, extremely good at it, and I can't tell whether it's her ISFP superpower of properly managing the outward radiance of her emotions or she just isn't interested in me. The numerous times we've hung out, I feel like nothing but a simple friend to her. On the other hand, I think I have given enough signals to show that I'm interested, such as going to great lengths to help her plan her extended trip overseas, even gifting her stuff she needed to take with her. She's quite slow paced and feeble-minded(for lack of a better word), and I am more than willing to use my Ti and logic to help her with anything. I do little things here and there(cause I know ISFPs appreciate action more than words) to convey how I feel. Matter of fact, I feel like I've done so much(my ability to solve problems with ease has been a welcome addition to her disorderly and reckless way of diving into things without thinking it seems) I need to scale back the charity before I scare her off.

But even then, she hasn't done anything to reciprocate. It bothers me and drives me crazy. Normally I'm really good at noticing subtle cues that girls give off that scream interest, as I've had a fair share of girls in the past(unfortunately mostly ESFJ, ESFP). But when it comes to her, she shows absolutely nothing.

If it means anything, I asked her to be my date to a wedding I'm attending next month, and she said yes. I sorta used it as a cry for help, because we are both vegan and I didn't want to sit with hundreds of carnivores alone at this wedding convention and wanted some company, but she nodded almost immediately. Now I'm not sure if she's just being a really supportive friend or sees it as an excellent opportunity to further our relationship. If she truly isn't interested in me, I don't think she would have agreed to such a thing because of the wrong implications that come with deciding to partake in such a thing with me...

Is all of this simply because she is still in the process of warming up to me? I understand that ISFPs seek long term partners and not flings. Will she eventually reciprocate further down the road? I want to bring up questions to set things straight between the two of us because I don't want to drag things on just to be hurt in the end. But I don't want to blow it too early. Is one month too short of a time period to judge, and should I give her more time to process how she feels inside(Fi)? I'm so perplexed on what to do, any advice offered is greatly appreciated.

isfp,"A while back, [we asked folks in this community to take a survey](https://www.reddit.com/r/isfp/comments/5xbw1g/make_your_voice_heard_tired_of_phone_calls/) and you all were kind enough to help us out. This post is a high level summary of the results of that survey.

(Note: for this summary, we will be using the term ""[extravert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraversion_and_introversion)"" as used in clinical analysis initiated by Carl Jung instead of the popularized spelling, ""extrovert."" )

# Introduction

The Movers &amp; Makers company is engaged in ongoing research about introverts, extraverts, age, occupation, and communication preferences. The original hypothesis was that introverts, or individuals in introvert-friendly occupations such as STEM, were more adverse to having a phone call disrupt their time, with some exceptions. In contrast, extraverts, or individuals in extravert-friendly occupations, were more open to phone calls. Our formal interviews showed this hypothesis to be incorrect and revealed a trend based more on age and occupation than temperament.

As an informal triangulation of our data, The Movers &amp; Makers research team decided to conduct surveys on popular social media and internet forums. The research has not yet concluded, but ""Phase 1"" of these informal surveys are complete and we'd like to share the results of these surveys. The results of this informal survey coincided with our formal research and also contradicted the original hypothesis. This summary is not an analysis of our hypothesis, our formal research, or of the informal research. This summary is only a brief overview of the informal survey results.

# Summary

In addition to essential demographic questions, the questions of the survey took the form of ""I work for a company that has never done business with you and I'd like to introduce myself."" The possible answers included, ""Call your phone number,"" ""Send you an email,"" ""Send you an SMS,"" ""Send you an MMS,"" and ""Send you an IM."" We also asked two, somewhat open-ended questions that emphasized the positive and negative consequences of the communication preferences.

## Overall Preferences

Our initial observations, which initiated our research, were that there are some people that don't like to be called on the phone and would prefer to be contacted by other means. This survey supported the observation with less than a third of respondents preferring  a phone call (31.3%) over alternative methods. Email was the preferred method by half of the respondents (49.6%).

[Overall Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/UmRoBq3)

Granted, the spectrum of scenarios may have been biased toward phone-call-aversion, so this is not an absolute reflection of preferences, but merely a summary of the preferences reflected in this survey. 

### Introvert-Extravert Preferences

Breaking down the data between introverts and extraverts yielded an insignificant difference between the two temperaments. Introverts preferred a phone call in 30.61% of responses. Extraverts preferred a phone call in 31.41% of responses. This is a difference of only 0.8% and is much smaller than we anticipated.

[Introvert Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/p7S4Djk)

[Extravert Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/9eww0um)

The similarities between introvert and extravert coincide with our formal research and are also reflected in the breakdown of most of each questions that follow.

#### Ambivert Preferences

While ""ambivert"" is not a part of some personality/temperament models, many contemporary research make allowances for ambiverts. In our case, we are including the term because people that identify as ambiverts seem themselves as distinct from both extraverts and introverts and they may have a distinct profile. However, the number of respondents describing themselves as Ambiverts is too small to comprehensively study and we recommend a more in-depth study of ambiverts and communication preferences.  Still, as a note of interest, we'll include the results here, though we caution against drawing any conclusions. Ambiverts responded with a preference for email at 54.6% and phone calls at 19.2%.

[Ambivert Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/5CHYPha)

### Male-Female Preferences

Our original hypothesis did not account for sex or gender. We allowed for the selection of ""sex"" in the survey to satisfy any curiosity of biological temperament selection. As we suspected, there isn't a large or significant difference in correlation of sex to communication preferences as borne out in our formal research and reflected in these survey results.

[Male Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/VeC5EeV)

Overall, male respondents selected a preference for a phone call in 34% of responses with females selecting phone calls in only 28.6% of responses. Email was the preferred response for both males and females in 49.3% and 49.7% of responses respectively.

[Female Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/Npq6ZeS)

#### Gender and Non-traditional Genders

We specifically did not include the word ""gender"" in this survey because the study of gender is outside of the scope of our current research. We allowed for the answers of ""Prefer not to say,"" and ""Other"" with an open field to promote the completion of the survey, but this survey is not equipped to tackle gender. Even with this allowance, only 0.1% of respondents answered with a non-traditional sex. Of that 0.1%, some of the respondents showed open hostility to the survey in their comments, indicating that this answer was not truly reflective of the respondent. The answers from these respondents were removed from our analyzed results.

That does not mean, however, that we do not value research regarding gender. We believe that the identification of gender and that correlation to communication preference might be quite significant. It is simply that we have not begun to tackle the question at this time. We would openly welcome input or recommendations from anyone with knowledge or expertise in this area.

### Generational Preferences

The first of two areas with distinctive responses is the difference in generation. The age groups that we call ""Millennials"" are the least resistant to phone calls, with 31.6% of responses, and yet 48.4% of the Millennial responses prefer email. Millennials were also more open to ""alternative"" communication methods such as IM, SMS, etc. with about 20% of the responses in total.

[Millennial Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/fJBFPKj)

The age groups that we call ""Generation X,"" or ""Gen X,"" are slightly more resistant to phone calls with only 29.1% of responses preferring a phone call and 57.3% preferring email.

[Gen X Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/mAotSZr)

The age groups that we call ""Baby Boomers,"" or just ""Boomers"" are the most resistant to phone calls with only 23.6% of responses preferring a phone call and 72.7% preferring email. Boomers were the most resistant to ""alternative"" communication methods with only 3.6% of responses for SMS and zero responses for the other methods.

[Boomer Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/U7Yng1Z)

### Occupational Preferences

The second of two areas with distinctive responses is the difference in occupation, or, occupational ""wings"" as we call them. These wings are simply divided into occupations that are [STEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics)-related and non-STEM-related. The survey results reinforced our formal research and part of our hypothesis that respondents in STEM-related fields are more resistant to phone calls than their non-STEM peers. Respondents in STEM-related fields responded with 23.5% of responses preferring phone calls and 57.4% preferring email.

Responses in non-STEM-related occupations were more receptive to phone calls, but only with 34.2% of the responses and 46.7% preferring email.

## Scenario Preferences

We asked respondents to imagine a range of hypothetical scenarios and how they'd prefer to be contacted in those scenarios. The scenarios spanned a variety of business-oriented communications that fall onto a spectrum what we term ""cold to hot"" in order indicate the amount of familiarity the two parties have already established. We also asked about preferences in various degrees of urgency and responsibility.

It is probably unsurprising that the more distant and less urgent relationships are the most resistant to phone calls and the nearest and more urgent relationships are the most receptive to phone calls. In the ""coldest"" scenario, *I work for a company that has never done business with you and I'd like to introduce myself*, responses were predictably low on preferring a phone call with only 8% of responses and 85% preferring email. In this scenario, the differences between introvert and extravert were negligible, but the differences in generation were in-line with the overall responses. STEM and non-STEM responses were also in agreement with the overall responses.

Also, predictably, the ""hottest"" scenario, *I have an emergency (business emergency, not life or death)*, included 74.6% of responses favoring a phone call and 5.9% preferring email. As an interesting note, in this scenario, more respondents preferred SMS to email with 13.7% of the responses.

[Emergency Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/IOxd25R)

The scenarios that emphasized cool or hot combined with responsibility, however, were a little surprising. For the scenario, *I'm a customer with a question (it's your responsibility to answer customer questions),* the responses were similar to the warm business responses. 19% of responses preferred a phone call for customer questions and 72.2% of responses preferred email.

[Cool Customer Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/2FOARrW)

The scenario, *I'm a customer with a problem (it's your responsibility to handle customer problems),* showed a surprising 61% preferring email and only 31.2% preferring a phone call.

## Consequences

We were also interested in understanding what impact these preferences have on the communication recipient. We set up a pair of questions in the survey to give respondents a chance to demonstrate the perceived consequences, both positive and negative. The negative consequences include, ""I mostly roll with it--no big deal"" (16.8%), ""I find it irritating and frustrating"" (24.3%), and ""The interruption negatively affects my work"" (16.5%), as well as, ""I may decide not to reply or continue communication"" (17.8%). The most damaging consequences would be ""I lose some respect for the person contacting me"" (7.3%), and ""I may block that person, or mark their contact as 'spam' or 'junk'"" (6.5%).

[Negative Consequences Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/RbL1A2Q)

Conversely, when the respondents' preferences were respected, there were positive consequences, including, ""It helps me manage my schedule"" (14.3%), ""I feel I'm more productive and efficient"" (13.9%), ""I believe I can dedicate the proper amount of attention to the communication"" (21.5%), ""I'm less irritated"" (20%), and ""It reduces my anxiety"" (18.8%).

# Conclusion

Our initial observations were that most people don't like receiving phone calls. Perhaps it's no mystery that the manner in which communication technology evolved puts the telephone front-and-center to business communication. However, our ongoing research shows that most people find phone calls to be disruptive and intrusive. Using the phone as a primary source of communication could be damaging to business relationships and to the overall economic health of our collective society. 

Looking at this research, we can see why ""cold calling"" feels ineffective and like ""a waste of time"" to many people. ""Cold emails"" are more likely to be effective and seem to have a lower downside. In fields like recruiting, it may be damaging for the hiring side of the relationship to initiate contact with a phone call. 

Yes, the research is ongoing, but it seems relatively clear that the phone should not be the first point of contact in any scenario, unless we know for certain that the recipient would prefer a phone call or we know for certain that the purpose of the contact is an emergency (the definition of ""emergency"" is somewhat subjective and needs to be judiciously applied). In business scenarios, the least risky option for contacting anyone is to use email and the most risky is to use alternative methods like MMS, or even IM. But, phone calls seem equally risky by the same standards considering that email seemed to dominate the responses.

As an illustration of the resistance to phone calls, this is a comment from the survey, ""I hate phone calls, almost unconditionally.  Texting or e-mails are always preferable unless it's really an emergency."" And, another comment, ""I do not generally like speaking on the phone because it's a purely auditory activity, and I am a visual person... I like time to process what's going on and formulate a response, otherwise I feel flustered and anxious."" These and several other comments are reflective of the overall tone of this survey. There were no equivalent comments showing resistance to email. 

Our research currently only analyzes the state of things as they are, not *why* things are as they are. For example, why are Boomers more resistant to phone calls than Millennials? Why are STEM-related occupations more resistant to phone calls than non-STEM-related fields? Why are extraverts as equally resistant to phone calls as introverts? What is the significance of gender in communication preference? How might this study be different if we focused on personal scenarios instead of business scenarios?

All of these questions push us to recommend further research in this area. We know that we are continuing to research this area, but our small contribution covers only a fraction of needed research.

We will begin ""Phase 2"" of this research soon. If you're interested in participating, keep a watch on our blog for updates. This topic will remain a topic of interest for The Movers &amp; Makers Company and our research is ongoing.

I have 1 close friend right now, my sister. But there is somebody else who I have a very good gut feeling about trust-wise . I think he is an INFP, and he seems very mature. I got to know him a few years ago at a summer internship program and I know he has a pretty good character (I am pretty good at vetting people btw in an Enneagram 8ish way, and almost everyone fails the tests). and We both have had similar psychological experiences, it seems (lack of trust, depression, avoidant personalities). We knew right away about each other that we were kind of on the same wavelength (in a non sexual way). Him and my sister are the only people I have ever had this feeling with, the kind of person I never get into a flight with. (Yes you might be thinking I am overreading into this but no, I am not, I have good evidence to back this up.)

He is also very supportive in general.

It's also non-toxic and has been described as an anti-addictive drug (!) because of its potential to treat alcoholism and other addictions. Here in Norway we also have a political organization, [EmmaSofia](http://www.emmasofia.org/), working to legalize MDMA and psilocybin.

isfp,"Hello. I know this is not the most appropriate sub to post something like this but as a fellow isfp (or at least I believe I am) I have gotten tired of studying economics which I took just to take a career, I know, big mistake.

Now though, I've taken some time off from university to find out what do I truly want to do throughout my life and since I've played videogames, written and read stuff as early as I could remember I thought that the department mentioned in the title could just be the thing I've been looking for. Giving me a chance of storyboarding my long time inspired ideas by videogames, draw (which I'm not particularly good at at all but willing to get good at) and make games! Overall just express myself and make a job out of those ideas!

What has me worried about this though is programming. A friend of mine took his fair share of it and he didn't seem to enjoy it all that much.  He has taken some time to explain to me what's that All about and I can't help but be rather intimidated by it. Math and numbers overall have never been my strong suit and I'm genuinely worried that it might make me regret this choice.

Some suggest trying a career that has to do more with literature and while I'm not against it I would be lying if I didn't say that I find it a bit tedious at times.  

I do have a ""backup choice"" if anything and that would be learning a 3rd language (currently know 2) and give translation a shot, videogame translation if given the chance would be great. The languages I'm interested in are Japanese or Chinese maybe both if possible. While it isn't as much of an expressive profession as I would like I find it genuinely fun to learn a language since you are learning so much more than just the language. Culture, ideals and many other things fall there as well.

 However in my current nearby area there are no bachelors provided by any university that involve any of the previously mentioned languages, the closest thing are electives so not much hope there...

What do you guys suggest/think about this situation?

Any sort of input helps and thanks in advance!

isfp,"Here is a bit of background, hopefully you think it is a funny story.

This girl was leading me on so I asked her out and got rejected, and I realized the other day she was just using me for something.

instead of getting over it like a normal person and processing my emotions healthily by say, talking to a human, playing video games, eating 1000 gallons of ice cream (I think this is what an xNFP would do?) I decided to make an album, and music videos to it to top it off.

Just for fun here is what I think each type would do in this situation (if acting unhealthily- if they are acting healthily, the action will be the same regardless.)

**Guardians**

ISTJ- After their Te has failed to get them a date after taking the necessary steps they will retreat into Si / Fi, projecting negative emotional intent onto people- my mom is stuck in a vicious Si / Fi loop, it's not good

ISFJ- Si / Ti loop- they may rethink why they got rejected over and over again.

ESTJ- Te / Ne- they may dream up tons of grandiose plans and try to enact them.

ESFJ- Fe / Ne- they may seek more and more admiration from others

**Rationals**

I understand rationals much better than guardians so this is probably a lot more accurate than the last section.

INTP- Ti / Si- they will remember every date they went on and what went wrong, and conclude there is no logical reason for social interaction, basically becoming a schizoid

INTJ- Ni / Fi - they will rely upon internal validation such as their feelings in a given situation to reject anyone who might try to reject them next time

ENTP- Like the ESFJ stated earlier

ENTJ- Te/Se- they will become fixated on making their environment perfect and may resemble enneagram 8s

Idealists / Artisans I don't understand well enough to comment on.

I've toughened up more over the years however I still have never been able to develop a thick skin.

isfp,"I have a theory that I am a jaded ISFP although a lot of people have mistyped me as an ISTP / xNTJ because I come off as cold to almost everyone (common for ISTPs IME) and xxTJ because I have a very simplistic (though rigid and crucial) moral code and have developed good Te after many years spent in stress relying upon the grip function.

First of all Fi is definitely my dominant function. Based on my personal experience I have a set of values (although it is very simplistic, meaning most situations are amoral) and Se is quite likely my secondary function (making music / art is my main hobby). Ni for third (I can usually predict how things will go and I am good at finding the underlying truth) and Te for fourth (my Te &gt; Ti) I can see. There are many decisions I make with Fi which Se/Ni/Te would scoff at.

Most of the ISFP descriptions focus on how ISFPs are concerned about preserving harmony, keeping others happy, charity, fulfilling their personal values in their environment, etc (basically an E9). However my personal moral set is very individualistic, more like libertarianism. Although I am a fairly nice person in general I don't go out of my way to preserve harmony / make others happy / etc. and because my personal experiences are more negative my Fi has made me very jaded: I am very cynical about other people and there is no one I fully trust. This is because my personal experiences have told my Fi that no one can be trusted (like an unhealthy E8). This is in contrast with most ISFP descriptions which are very idealistic, about over-trusting friends / significant others / etc.

Furthermore, I take more pleasure in seeing the (very) few people I dislike / hate suffering hardship than I do in seeing someone I consider ethical succeed. I also have a vague sense of dysphoria all the time, I never feel really happy, though sometimes I feel stimulated and confuse that for joy. I also was rather depressed for the majority of my life up to present in retrospect which led me to completely pack away my emotions, to the point that people call me robotic and emotionless. They still do now, even as emotions about normal things like working on a homework assignment overwhelm me, it's just that my emotions are hidden now.

I feel like an unhealthy 8 in a sea of Nines, lol.

BTW I think my tritype is 348 sp/sx. Very heavy on the sp, light on the sx.

I was on another music forum and someone literally said ""I don't have anything to compare this to so I can't give feedback on it"" (very heavy Si).

isfp,"Today I was having lunch with a friend. Then a YouTube notification came up. I checked it and it was a video of a newly introduced champion in a video game I play. In it, there is this girl engineer, and after a few moments I thought about how nice it is that people are introducing characters like this to break stereotypes and empower children. Then I thought about all the discrimination women had to endure to this day and the thoughts turned into feelings and they all overwhelmed me and I welled up, my eyes brimming with tears, almost spilling. My friend (girl) asked me (guy), ""What's wrong, your face is red?"" and I waved it away. People at next table were glimpsing at me as if I'm weird. (I was.)

A few days ago, I was listening to a Hungarian guitarist, and his sounds were beautiful but the way he conveyed them was even more beautiful. And I remembered this Spanish violinist whose music lifted me up from my severe, suicidal depression years ago. Then I was thinking that this guitar dude is ""literally"" saving people from death with his music. That moved me and I welled up and this time I was alone at home so I shed a tear or two and sniffled.

Does this happen to ISFPs too? I know some INFPs and they all attest to that this happens to them. I was wondering if ISFPs experience this too, since they are feelers too. There's no ISFP near me.

Before you say ""its the thought that counts"", let's just say I would leave a dead bird on his doormat and call it a gift.

That would freak him out for sure, but the joy of giving would certainly be one-sided.

Anyway, I noticed he liked cool &amp; comfort things. My friends and I got him a bean bag chair last year and he couldn't stop grinning.

isfp,"Buckle up people because this is gonna be a long ride.

Lets start with January 2016 I was with my girlfriend gonna call her Number 1 as she will be mentioned a lot and obviously don't wanna use her name. And life was okay. I was in a relationship with someone I loved more than anyone. Was trying to redeem myself as I had broken up with her 3 times within around 3 years and every time there was not a single reason to break up with her she was amazing to me, I would just get in a bad mood and make rash decisions instead of talking to her. I also had some problems with housing and had to live with my friend and at first it was alright, but the longer I was there the worse I felt and I was down pretty much all the time, My job at a hotel was shit because a new manager came in and he didn't know what he was doing. and my friends house was making me feel worse everyday that went by. I ended up getting really down one night and decided to break up with my Girlfriend. At the time I was like ""Man this is exactly what I needed"" she obviously hated me after that as this was now the fucking 4th time, She deleted me off of social media and didn't want to talk to me at all. about a month passes and I realise that I miss Number 1 more than anything and I've fucked up big time yet again, and started really hating myself to the point where I tried to kill myself. As you can tell i'm still here so yeah that didn't work out, After that I was still really down and eventually quit my job as I couldn't bare being there anymore.

I then met some girl online who gave me a lot of attention so we got talking and hung out and all was well. I meet up with some friends and one of them asks if its okay if he asks Number 1 out as they had been spending a lot of time together, In my head I was like 'no fuck off she's mine, I need her' but I couldnt say that so I said ""yeah fine"" etc so they date, and me and the girl I met online started dating too and I was like man this is sure gonna take my mind off of number 1! a month goes by and my friend says his mum doesn;t want me to stay there anymore, I couldn't argue as you know it's her house. I stayed round a few friends houses for a few days and it got to a point where I had nowhere left, My mum and younger sister were living in really shitty situations and I wasn't able to live with them, Brother was living on his own getting on Cocaine every week, and i'm homeless at this point, My gf at the time said if I have nowhere I can stay at hers. So I did that as I had no other option. Things were okay but I slowly realised that she wasn't the one. Like we got on really well and we didn't argue but she didn't come anywhere near to Number 1.

So skip forward about 5-6 months and My mum finds a home so I can move back in with them and I was beyond happy as I missed my family. I get a job at a store near me and everything was coming up. But then anxiety decided to say hi, and interacting with customers at worked started to scare me a lot and it got to the point where I broke down and started crying in the middle of the aisle in front of the customers and it was fucking awful. Luckily I haven't had an experience at work as bad as that so far.

I go through a bit of an episode and decide to try and be a better person, as the way I treated the one person I loved more than anything wasn't how I wanted to treat her (Not paying enough attention, being selfish) I avoid pretty much 98% of my friends and for about 2 months I havent seen most of my friends and I realise how much I don't actually like most of them and that they probably didn't help my moods.

Number 1 is then going through tough times with her boyfriend and I am there for both of them and talking to them trying to help them both through it and it didn't work out in the end. Me and Number 1 started talking a bit more and became friends again and I was so happy because I had missed talking to her so much as we had a lot in common and our humour was similar. I then slowly realise as we talk more that I never actually got over her and so I'm in this mess as my current gf and I aren't doing too great and I've realised i'm still in love with Number 1.

A month or so pass and me and gf have split up. and so one day i'm talking to Number 1 and I get a message out of the blue saying something along the lines of ""Are you free? I need to talk to you about something"" (bare in mind at this point I have said to her about how I felt about her) I then get a message a few minutes later from my other friend who's pretty much one of the only friends I still like ""Saying we need to talk so let me know when you're free"" I'm confused as hell and also terrified at this point because someone asking to talk is usually never good. Number 1 messages me saying how they don't know how to tell me this news so she just comes out and says how Her and my other friend slept with each other just a bit after she broke up with her bf, and it fucking crushed me. (quick side note I forgot about. me and number 1 stayed round that friends house one night. Number 1 fell asleep and me and the friend spoke about life and I explained to him about my love for Number 1 and how i feel etc. it confused me because usually he's always super advice heavy or comforting and he wasn't this time so it was odd but I was like eh he's probably just tired) So yeah when I got told that I just fucking broke down for a few hours and basically just cried myself to sleep. 

And since then I've pretty much just been beating myself up about how much of a dick I was to Number 1 throughout the years and how i've basically thrown away the best thing that's ever happened to me. Been feeling shit about work. and not really liking any of my 'friends'
On the plus side its my birthday today and I got some money from family so I can upgrade my PC so I got that going for me (Also quick side update Brother is no longer on cocaine so that's also a good thing) 

So yeah sorry for the stupidly long essay. I just wanted to get this out as I had this bottled up for too long and had no one to talk to about it.  ",1488179130

We do have common interests in strange and obscure music and but that is about it. She is amazed by the number of hobbies I have and how easily I am bored of them and the random stuff I know in many subjects while I am amazed by her self-confidence even though she herself said she is useless in most things. I love how she finds the beauty in even simple everyday things. 

She writes haikus which are about extremely ordinary things and they seem extremely pointless and useless to write about but they did seem sort of cool. I guess I just don't know how to appreciate them yet. I wrote her one back when I thought of one while reading the Wikipedia article on haikus when I was shitting but it was not really about a ""fleeting moment in nature"" but she liked it enough.

She has very little ambition and is fine with just a shitty retail job while writing poems on the side. Which really sort of annoyed me. We do tend to have similar views on how we want to become Icelandic animal herders but I don't know man. 

Also she is capable of just relaxing and looking at nature or the night sky and admire its beauty. How does one just do that without spacing out or start thinking about other stuff?

I had a huge crush on her but the more and more I talk to her the more and more I am sort of put off by her. I think? I just want to see why my brain decided to choose her as my infatuation.

Thanks for being you.*

I'm not sure if this is an original thought or if it's something that's common among us, but I find myself feeling very misplaced in a sort of limbo between introvert and extrovert.

There's no denying that I very much enjoy my alone time. When you're alone, you don't have to worry about entertaining another person, about if what you're saying sounds stupid, or if you're gonna stutter over your rehearsed words. There's so much peace in being alone, and I love the freedom to choose to do whatever the hell I want without someone paying attention to me. It's easier being alone. I've canceled many a plan last minute.

However, aside from the slight relief that myself and many people get from canceling plans, I take little joy from the act. Because while being alone is peaceful, it's also lonely. I've noticed that I don't get any energy from being alone. I may have small, infrequent doses of motivation and ambition, but usually only in the form of cleaning or organizing. I typically do not feel very happy when I'm alone. 

I do love going out, being around people, and having many new experiences. I feed so heavily off the energy of the people around me and the environment I'm in. Is that just empathy, or extroversion? Because, correct me if I'm wrong, the raw definition of extroversion is gaining energy from people around you, whereas introversion is gaining energy from yourself. And that's where my conflict of thought comes in, because energy is rarely something I can give myself. But the other side of that conflict comes in where I can get absolutely exhausted from being around people and socializing for an extended period. So other people is where I get my energy from, but it's also what sucks the energy out of me once I have it.

So really I'm just trying to see if other people feel like this and I'm just over thinking everything, or if maybe I need to think deeper into why I am how I am.

So I'm ENTJ and I've gone out a couple times with an ISFP gal. She's beautiful and hilarious and I like hanging out with her...

But I have no earthly clue as to how to read her.

When we're together she gives literally 0 signs towards any sort of physical escalation (we've gone on 2 or 3 dates at this point), and have been texting nearly constantly.

She seems to enjoy hanging out and has said she wants to do it again, but she's cancelled several times now.

I've been wondering something about my fellow ISFPs. One of the main reasons why I had such a hard time accepting that I was an ISFP, is that they always seem to be described as ""artsy"". I've never really been much of an artist myself in any way. I am the sort who likes to ""stop and smell the roses"" but never had any drive to recreate what I've seen through art. I always felt like I could never do the real world any sort of justice so to speak. Plus I'm just not skilled in that way.

I get very excited to buy a game and playing the beginning, yet never get to the end as I either get bored of it, just don't finish it when I mean to or take looong breaks (years). An example of this is Bioshock, as five years on from starting it I still haven't finished it and am only in Fort Frolic with photograph man, where I have been for the past two years.

However I have realised I tend to play a lot more games where there is no particular end, or they end quickly. I have over 1000 hours on both Team Fortress 2 and League of Legends. I have a lot of hours on games such as the Binding of Isaac and Terraria, where you can play for a while and stop whenever you want, only to pick it up again months later.

So I asked her to take the test again. She took the one on 16personalities and got ISTP. I'm not a big fan of that site, but it is what it is. 

Now, I think ISTP fits her better then ISFJ, but I really feel that ISFP fits her the best. 
I posted this on the ISTP subreddit and most people thought ISFP as well. 
Here are some notes on my wife and I was wondering if you all could let me know if she sounds ISFP. 

----------
Comes off cold to others but is very sensitive to what I say. Sometimes way to sensitive to my sarcastic jokes. Sometimes she loves my humor, other times she thinks I go to far. 

Often takes what I say and assumes something negative is meant or inferred when I was just stating a fact. 

She sometimes assumes I should know what she is thinking, which usually ends badly.

Is a great and loving mother. She is very free to let the kids follow their own path, as long as they don't spend too much time on the ipad. She is great at homeschooling and develops specific learning plans for each of our sons.

Has days where she is very touchy feely and close and days where she is very distant. I used to wonder if she was mad at me, but now I just give her space.

She does not enjoy abstract concepts as much as I do, such as talks about philosophy, religion, physics, etc.

She likes graphs and numbers to a point. She has always been interested in stock trading and knows tons about market analysis, etc. She studied to be an accountant but never finished her degree. Usually  has some projects going.

She's not really into taking things apart, mechanically. I am the one that does that. I always fix her computer, work on the cars and tractors, plumbing, etc. She loves gardening. She is not really artistic but is great with colors. We recently built a house together and she picked out all the colors and they worked great. Very visual learner. She needs pictures to grasp something.

I could never picture her being a nurse, but I could see her being a teacher. She loves children and seems to have way more patience with them then she does with adults. She also loves animals. 

She only has a few friends and is fine with that.

If she is interested in a subject she will devour anything she can find on it. If she is not interested in anything at the moment, she just watches netflix.

She doesn't appear outwardly empathetic.  

Seems motivated by emotions. She will make a decision based on emotions and intuition, whereas I will make a decision based purely on logic and my plan. She actually can help me in this because if something has to be decided but I can not see the logically correct course, I can get paralyzed, or change my mind too often.

She sucks at planning trips. I always to have to plan our trips, and she is happy that I do. She is happy to just be a long for the ride. This generally works out great and we both have a good time. She prefers I drive everywhere, because again, she just enjoys the ride.

Has complete trust in my ability to plan and figure stuff out. If I get frustrated she just tells me I'll figure it out eventually, which does help, because it reminds me to stay with it. She did follow me half-way across the ocean to peruse my dream because she believed in me. 

She is active in some sports. She grew up on the swimming team. She exercises (Tae Bo) every day. But she doesn't like the riskier sports. I tried to teach her snowboarding, but she was to afraid of the speed. Now that our boys are learning snowboarding, she will go to the mountain with us, but just stays on the bunny hill with skis. 

She thinks personality tests are silly, but she indulges me a bit because I explained they help me. I would ask her to take more tests, but it was like pulling teeth to get her to take just the one.

She loves to read non-fiction and biographies. I read tons of sci-fi and she can't understand why I like it so much. She loves Kung-Fu movies though! She also does like some sci-fi movies (not star wars). We watch movies differently. I tend to analyze them and remember them, but she'll forget she even watched a movie a few months later. It's not that she has a bad memory, I think she just watches movies to relax and be in the moment. 

Procrastinates on some things, but not others. She loves a clean house, but her home office is usually a mess. She has taken huge strides to be more organized. Her digital file system is non-existent, meaning her computer files are all over the place and she has like 1000 unread emails in her inbox with 1000 tabs open in her browser. It drove me a little crazy at first, but now I think its cute and funny.

I could go on, but I feel like I have gone on to long already. Thanks for your opinions.

So I'll smile and talk to her and try to joke around but I'm worried because it's work so a number of things could go wrong. I don't really know what I'm doing or how to flirt or tell if she likes me back or not. 

I do seem to favor my sense of touch so I would imagine if I ever get to have a relationship I would be into physical contact and communication. I can talk but it's usually when I'm interested in something or have something to say so so I'm not very good at small talk but I'm working on it and trying to put effort into that. I'm pretty guarded with my feelings since they are so strong and sad and painful for me so if I was willing to show that part of myself I would really have to trust someone and even then it would be terrifying to be that vulnerable. I also had an emotionally abusive and neglectful childhood though so that could be because I'm so damaged and broken. I'm starting to think it would be better for me to not be in a relationship because I'm so fucked up and don't understand relationships and don't think that anyone would or could ever want me. Maybe it would just be better for everyone to just accept that I'll be alone and try to move on.

I know there are a million variations within each mbti type, and in the end we're all individuals. With that disclaimer, I'm curious to hear whether other people's experiences can lend insight or guidance to my quest.

I tried an ESTJ, but he was too dominant and insensitive. (But he could be an exception. Thoughts?)

Tried ENFP twice, but in both cases the connection was lacking after the infatuation wore off. 

Dated a possible INFJ, felt a strong connection but our mutual struggle with anxiety and depression accumulated and poisoned the relationship. We were also very young and immature... I suspect INFJ could actually be a good match in healthier circumstances? 

With an INTJ, I felt a strong connection. He was a quiet one, and I liked that he was decisive without dominating, always stable and predictable. He had this beautiful logical computer-brain that would never start drama or read into something I said. Made me calm, eased anxiety. But he had very little social drive and required too much alone time. I felt lonely and neglected. But he loved me as deeply as any robot ever could, with that cold metal heart of his.

It bothers me because we live pretty close to each other and lately I've been really craving some kind of social connection, but she's been avoiding me, cancelling plans etc. Like I said, she texts me constantly but every time I say 'hey do you wanna go for a drink?' she gets all shady and tells me she's in ""hermit mode"" right now and she just wants to be by herself. But she's lying because there's this other group of friends that she often goes out to bars with and to music gigs etc. I see her mutual friends posting pictures of her online and it makes me wonder why she always says 'no' to me and 'yes' to them.

I tried to be straight with her. I said ""look I'm just feeling a bit lonely these days and I'd love to be able to hang out at the pub or just be in the company of you and few other friends"". She said something like ""yeah we'll have to hang out soon"" but it's always really vague.

Is this usual for an ISFP? Why does she call me her best friend and text me lots but never wants to hang out with me? Is she ashamed of me? Is there a better way to get ISFPs attention?",1485291893

isfp,"There are a lot of things I could write about, but I'll be as short as possible.

I took the 16personalities test several times, getting 98% Introverted, 85% feeling and 90% Prospective. Every time I passed it I got a different S/N result, always hovering at around 50%.

I read things about both INFP and ISFP, and I really really liked what I read about INFP. I resonated with INFP a lot, and had some amount of inconsistencies with ISFP.

Then I specifically took the Se/Si, Ne/Ni tests and got Se:Ni, which is, you know it, ISFP.

I'm overly panicking and just can't settle down with this, I'm anxious about something as simple as a personality test.

What is happening? Is this common or am I a special snowflake? How do I stop freaking out? How do I.. accept myself, I guess?",1484788729
isfp,"So this is the original post that I posted on r/my_mbti_type and someone suggested that i could be isfp so I'm posting this here just to be sure. Am I ISFP? I am sorry in advance for the really long post. 

I've been taking mbti test and my results are never constant. I've tested as isfj, istj, istp, isfp and intp.

I want to put an end to this madness.

**1) What aspect of your personality made you unsure of your type?**
I tested as istj and istp the most. I relate a lot of traits of istj and istp. I don't think I'm istj cause they are potrayed as too rigid. I changes my principles constantly based on new informations. But I can't be istp either cause I'm not adrenaline junkie and I don't take things apart. I'm not into the cars or bikes. 

**2) What do you yearn for in life? Why?**
Adventures and I want to not be bothered with the hassles that comes with being a human. I dislike having to eat, shower and sleep. Especially when I'm in the middle of doing something I love.

**3) Think about a time where you felt like you were at your finest. Tell us what made you feel that way.**
Made a really good joke that cracked everyone up. My friends seem to love my sense of humor.

**4) What makes you feel inferior?**
When people easily solve a problem that I took so much time to solve. When people seems to know the right things to say to comfort people and I have nothing. How some people are really confident and at ease with others. I'm bad at social interaction.

**5) What tends to weigh on your decisions? (Do you think about people, pro-cons, how you feel about it, etc.)**
If it's for myself, I'll think of what I can afford. If it's something expensive, research first. If it's something cheap, just go there and see what they have. I love buying practical things that makes my life easier. I don't think about other people when I make decision for myself. 

**6) When working on a project what is normally your emphasis? Do you like to have control of the outcome?**
I value quality work. I like having control over a project. I lost my interest if I don't have a say in it. If there's a project I like, I'll give it my full attention. Especially if it involves hands on work. I dislike theoretical work.

**7) Describe us a time where you had a lot of fun. How is your memory of it?**
A road trip with friends. Listened to a really good playlist. Looking at trees at each side of the road. Endless hills and meadows. We were lost at one point. Had a few detours. Ended climbing hills. It was fun. My memories of it is Radiohead's No Suprises is a really good song for a roadtrip.

**8) When you want to learn something new, what feels more natural for you? (Are you more prone to be hands on, to theorize, to memorize, etc)**
Hands on. I learn better by watching people do something and copy them. 

**9) How organized do you to think of yourself as?**
Not so organized. My work space has to be organized or I won't be able to think. I take care of shared space and make sure it's clean and organized. For my own personal space, i don't mind it being messy. I don't make plans. I hate tardiness. I can't stand people being late on a date or for a meeting. I always come earlier, at least 5 mins early. I feel uncomfortable making people wait.

**10) How do you judge new ideas? You try to understand the principles behind it to see if they make sense or do you look for information that supports it?**
I am very sceptical to new ideas but I'm open to be convinced. I'll look for information to support it and I'll think about the principles afterwards (if the info starts to become convincing).

**11) You find harmony by making sure everyone is doing fine and belonging to a given group or by making sure that you follow what you believe and being yourself?**
I'd like for everyone to be doing fine but I also like people minding their own business. So I won't ask what's wrong for fear of invading people's privacy and trust that they'll tell you you if they want you to know. If they look too distressed, I'll most probably will distract them with fail cat videos.

**12) Are you the kind that thinks before speaking or do you speak before thinking? Do you prefer one-on-one communication or group discussions?**
I always try to put some thought into it before I speak. So it's well summarized, clear and straight to the point. One-on-one communication for someone I'm trying to get to know so there's no other distractions. One-on-one and group discussions for people I already know. Group discussions with a bunch of people I don't know is a no no.

**13) Do you jump into action right away or do you like to know where are you jumping before leaping? Does action speak more than words?**
Knowing a little bit of it will help. I hate surprises so I need to know what to expect. Other than that, you can learn it along the way.

**14) It's Saturday. You're at home, and your favorite show is about to start. Your friends call you for a night out. What will you do?**
If I have had too much social interaction that day and I need some time alone, I'd stay at home. If not, I'd go.

**15) How do you act when you're stressed out?**
Distractions. If the problems has to be solved in the nearest time, I'd do something that doesn't require my attention (like a simple game), turn to auto pilot mode and try to solve the problem in my mind.

**16) What makes you dislike the personalities of some people?**

- People spending their time gossiping about other people like they don't have a life of their own
- People purposely doing bad things to other people out of fun
- People not respecting personal space and people's privacy
- People littering despite having the garbage can just 2 metres away from them
- People who have kids but can't be bothered to teach them manners
- People who walk slowly or side by side and blocking my way. 
- People telling me what to do
- People being inconsiderate

**17) Is there anything you really like talking about with other people?**
My interest. Movies, tv shows, books and games. Certain interesting topics. Just to see how many different ideas/opinions I can get from it.

**18) What kind of things do pay the least attention to in your life?**
My well being of course. I constantly missed my meals. I slept very late. I dislike the thought of showering unless if I can create a new way of showering or different showering experience. I smoke occassionally. Eat really unhealthy diet. My doctor has been complaining that my blood pressure is quite high for someone my age. 

**19) How do your friends perceive you? What is wrong about their perception? What would your friends never say about your personality?**
My friends think I'm funny, quiet, a little childish, prankster, antisocial, overthinking things to the point of paranoia, fun to be around and timid on social situation. They are not wrong but I act differently around different people so there are other side of me that's only shown to others or only for myself. My friends would never say that I'm confident.

**20) You got a whole day to do whatever you like. What kind of activities do you feel like doing?**
Camping or a road trip. If not, binge watch a good series and play games.

I used to think of it as my own personal growth and evolution, but I recently was told very harshly that I have no mine of my own and it's scary how easily influenced I am. Since then I've caught myself doing it and it really bothers me.

Do you ever feel like you are such a laid-back pushover that you lose yourself, and you have trouble remaining true to a self that you bury without thinking?

This is what I consider magic in reality.

When I'm told to dig deeper into this feeling I get insulted. Why would I dig to try and find something to consciously control it when I already have it happen organically. I have tried.. A lot. Each time I've damaged myself deeply trying to get the answer to this ""magic"". Some might consider this denial of something, others say it's a form of stubbornness, and worst of all it's attributed to being oblivious. When in reality all that is happening is my attention shifts to a different area than those around me. I pay attention to the feeling in the room the feelings of the people around me. Only when this core function is suppressed is when I retreat to my head. It's the only safe place if no one understands. I don't even care if they truly understand as much as I care that it's viewed so negatively. Although I see their point and agree that me being another person would be ideal, I am who I am. Human beings need acknowledgment from time to time. How can one acknowledge what one cannot concept.

I don't hate who I am, I hate how I'm perceived. To change that I have to change who I am, and fuck absolutely every single thing about that.

(I understand change needs to occur and I work everyday to grow and be a better person, please don't mis interpret that)

People believe in religion, spirituality, superstitions, and other stuff that in reality don't ""exist"" (I know I know we each have our own reality yeah I fucking get that.. I get it). So why can't things be more than what they are.

-Texted him to let him know that if he needed space, he could let me know and I would be ok with it   

-After slow textual responses, asked him to take a walk with me through Ikea, which he really liked   

-Told him that I liked him in the car and that I didn't want to push him, but that I needed some reassurance that he liked me and that I was willing to be patient with him so that we could build up trust   

-He was more open (even texting me first) after I told him that I liked him outright (which was scary), and told me that it was really thoughtful of me to have researched his personality type to better understand him and that he liked feeling more understood. He also told me that he would work on initiating more and being more relational which I am super excited for   


I really like him, so thank you this subreddit!! This place helped me better understand that it was a big freaking deal when he asked me out because it was a big risk on his part! I would have never known that he liked me and even after he asked me, I still wasn't sure because he wasn't very effusive or affectionate, but thanks to this subreddit, it helped me to not be so insecure and just be patient.     

I am excited for what is in store and will probably be back in the future. We haven't gone out on our official official date yet, where he asks me out and sets the time and place, but for now I want to give him that space to do that so he knows that I care that that is what he needs.

Example: prefers to say ""mind as well"" over ""might as well"". 

2. Right now, I've been waiting for her to get ready for a few hours now and if we don't leave soon enough, we won't make it in time for the place we're planning to go if we are going to do everything she wants to do. 

3. Is very good with colors, a little obsessed with them.

5. Abusive childhood. (Wondering if there are some ""nurture"" factors that have created her personality)

6. Hard to bring around new people. She only knows right when she meets someone whether or not she likes them, and if she doesn't like them, she tends to be on her phone the entire time. Though, she can be convinced of liking someone if they are persistent in getting to know her/are friendly enough.

7. Indecisive.

isfp,"This might be a long post, however I guess I just need to let it out. I'm on mobile, so hopefully my autocorrect doesn't fail me too often

I'm basically at a major crossroads. I learned that (to the best of my knowledge), I'm an ISFP, from the book, ""Do what you know""

I'll explain my personality related to my work, and also my current job situation

I worked in construction, hated it, and now work as an estimator in construction. I realize it just isn't for me, my current job, and construction in general. I have no interest in it. 

#There are several reasons I don't enjoy it.

1) The work itself doesn't interest me

2) I'm not good at it

3) It requires a lot of ""figuring out stuff on your own"", as opposed to a traditional training course.

4) I get bored easily, especially if I don't understand or care for something. It takes a ton of willpower to keep focus on the job at hand most days.

#Now how my brain works:

* Awful short term recall. If you tell me how to do something, I'll almost immediately forget, and if I right it down I might forget the context or even what I wrote down in general anyways. 

* I'm not very organized, and this job can require a lot of jumping around from one thing to another. This creates frustration as well as confusion if I'm told something. Im much slower at processing information (The ""Thinking"" personality trait), so if I'm told something, the gears in my head don't quite churn, but I'll just do what I'm told anyways, even if I don't understand, and don't have time to get more complex. I could be told something, but it might not actually register/make sense for an hour, day, or even week later


* Im not good at ""figuring things out"" a lot of the time, or veering off the path of what should be done to do the job. What I mean by this is (And this relates to not having a lot of knowledge in the field) is that I need to be told how to do something, if you told me how to think about doing it from a certain perspective, it's a lot more difficult for me to remember. I NEED structure and a system. Figuring things out is not my strength. The best way to explain it is my mind is like  a blank computer. I need to be given explicit instructions on what to do, if you said ""I want you to open Microsoft word"", I'd be lost. I need the exact computer.programming to do it, if that makes sense.

* Im not confident in my ability AT ALL. I second guess EVERYTHING. Even if I think I know the answer, or have a solid opinion, or have a question (as it relates to work), I'm going to ask myself 100 times first in my head to make sure Im not asking a dumb question, or make sure I haven't asked it before, or make sure Im not saying something wrong

* If I don't understand something, and I'm too afraid to ask what it means, or if I just can't wrap my head around it, I give up. I'll just go on Reddit. Even if there's a deadline ahead, I don't treat it as, I have to ""buckle down"". I'll browse the computer, and throw in work as I go.

* A lot of the job involves calling vendors, calling project managers about questions, etc. This is MAJORLY out of my comfort zone. Again, I always feel as though my question is dumb, and I'm wasting.my time asking. I assume I SHOULD know, so if I have to ask, then there's something I'm not understanding.

There mght be more I'm forgetting. But that's the gist

#My personality:

* Most days I feel as though I'd like a career helping people. But then I get nervous about if it pays enough. Then I get paranoid that ""Maybe that won't actually be the career I want"", and I lose all motivation to change careers. Constant indecision. 

* I'm not a big communicator. I'm not good at explaining how I feel or what I want to achieve. 

* I'm  a very bad long term thinker. I don't want to think in the future. It's tiring and annoying to me. I get exhausted trying to think about the future in terms of career, where I want to be, etc.

* I keep to myself. I'm a hermit. Besides my wife, I don't hang out with people unless I get to know someone. Even then I have no ""real friends"". Just people I might hang out with if I'm bored.

* I have high expectations in myself IF ITS SOMETHING I CARE ABOUT. I don't care about.my job, do I dont have too high of expectations. If I don't understand something, ""Oh well."" But I love to play football. If I don't make a play when I'm playing pickup or flag football, it will bother me all week. Just 1 play, or the whole game.

* I don't like expressing my feelings because I always assume people will just be annoyed. So besides to my wife and even her sometimes, I just keep my feelings to myself. And unless someone asks me first, I won't initiate hanging out with friends. So if I wanted to go watch football one night with some friends, I won't call them. If they don't ask me to go out with them, I won't go, because I won't ask them first. Again, I feel as though I'm bothering them, and if they wanted to hang out with me, they'd call first.

* If I understand something as it relates to work, I'll get this small ""spark"" work hard, then it dies down, and will go away completely if a new challenge comes up.

My hands are starting to hurt from texting, so I'll wrap up. 

I'm not sure what career I should change into, but I need to change. I know a lot of ISFP people get into art, mostly to express themselves, but that doesn't sound like me at all. Are there any jobs that would relate to how I explained myself? As do I sound like an ISFP at all anyways?

I love thinking about how the world and brain work, like quantum's mechanics and neuroscience and stuff, but I don't have the brain for it, and am paranoid if I could even get a job for it. I'm getting mentally exhausted even tho king about going to school for a degree, let alone how long it's take, and the work involved to be either.of those, or even a career change in general. All I know is I'm drained, bored (Think I need something not very routine at work, idk), etc. At my current career.

Sorry for the long, all over the place.post.Just kind of typing as I think.

Any advice helps

Thank you",1480966466

I'm a 22 year old female who has come to the conclusion that I'm a weirdo who does not fit in with the rest ofte world. What I mean by this is that my worldview and views on life is different from the views of most people I know. It seems like most people I know want to go to college, have a ""high power"" career, go through a string of shitty relationships before finally settling with ""the one"", and having a cohert of children who they think are ""special"" and ""unique"". Yes, I'd like to go to college, have a job, and perhaps a relationship, but I don't seem to view these things as life goals like how many other people do. I guess I'm just sick of the judgement that people pass on to others who do not share their ""life goals"". 





































































I can't relate to most of my peers. Anytime I try to connect with them, it goes horribly wrong. I especially cannot relate to my female peers. There, I said it. I can't relate to other females. I don't care if this pisses of feminist; I'm being extremely honest with myself, and what's wrong with being honest? It seems like everyone in my age group is obsessed with makeup, selfies, and pretending to care about social issues in order get attention. Everyone wants to be bubbly and nerdy. I'm just fucking sick of it. I'm sick of people thinking that something is wrong with me because I prefer to be reserved, serious, and entertain myself with my own thoughts.  The physical world does not interest me. The phony front that people put up irritates me. I can see right through it; I want to discover your own thoughts and ideas, not the crap that society feeds you and you regurgitate. 








































































































I feel a disconnect to the ""rituals"" of society. Again, I can see through it, and it angers me that others fall for it. If I try to explain to people why I refuse to participate in this crap, I getting told I'm crazy or that I need to see a psychologist. If I hear some tell me I need to ""live in the moment"" one more time, I think I'm going to rip my hair out. What is ""the moment"" anyways? 





































































































































I hate who I am. I hate that I'm not ""normal"", or that I just don't understand things that a huge hunk of society values. I don't know what job or career to pursue, and I don't know what to major in in college. I've thought about major in art history, English, and more recently political science, but those topics are considered ""impractical"". The problem I'm having is that the only thing that really interest me is researching topics and theories, and writing about them, and I don't know what profession that would translate to. 










































I'm just really pissed of at myself and the world. I feel like we could all achieve great things, but for whatever reason we don't. Rant/vent over. Thank you to whoever has the patience to read this tripe.

isfp,"Hi there. I was hoping some of you may have some experience with this.

My boyfriend is an INTJ and we've been having an issue with clashing feeling and thinking functions. We both get along wonderfully usually, but we approach stress very differently. He gets angry quite easily and will have a mini blow up about work or whatever, then be done with it. I, however, process for a long time and cry over it. He gets angry, I get sad. 

The issue here is that he thinks I cry too much. I do maybe every 2-3 weeks, depending on how stressed I am (I'm a college student and usually stretched pretty thin with my time and mental capacity.) I see him a couple times a week and sort of begin to relax, which releases the emotions I've kept inside. I usually feel much better after a mini cry session.

However, a couple weeks ago he did something that hurt me. I was feeling worse than usual because of a project going badly and I found myself sobbing. He shut himself in his room and went to bed, all the while telling me he was fine and not mad but not looking at me. He didn't even try to comfort me or anything, which made me more upset.

I have picked at him for it several times since then, because I don't turn to many people about my emotions (classic ISFP, keeping my aloof, emotionless demeanor in public) but I thought he was the kind of person I could do that with. I guess not? He says it's for his own sanity - that he can't handle my sadness, and that I need too much comfort from him.

This hurts me a tremendous amount, as someone who doesn't cry often in front of others and I feel as though I can't trust him with my very personal feelings, since they're apparently a burden.
Any insight? I'm trying very hard to understand but I have trouble doing so.

I don't know how to help my ISFP boyfriend motivate himself to accomplish things or even set goals for himself. Any advice from someone who has experienced this or had an ISFP friend/partner go through this?



Long Version

I'm currently dating an ISFP [M21] who seems to be having a lot of trouble with motivating himself/getting work done. He seems like he has depression (lack of interest in people, low self esteem, wants to do nothing like LITERALLY nothing all day long only brainless activities that require no thought like video games and netflix shows, doesn't want to socialize, and gets anxiety when people bring up future plans). It probably doesn't help that he's pursuing a degree he's not really interested in (Software engineering), although he does plan on getting another degree in game design so he can express his creativity, but this wont happen for a while.

I'm not sure how I [F21, ENTP] can help? Like a typical ENTP, I like to help motivate my partner and help them achieve their goals, however I don't know how to help someone who doesn't want to help themselves. I don't want to be overbearing or intruding, but I believe he may need a push to help him realize that there are things worth working for so you can feel happy. 

He is genuinely a kind person and we get along well for the most part, however when I bring this up, he gets very upset. He says he knows he has a problem but has no interest in doing anything about it because he's tried before and failed. He says he'd rather do things that require no thought because it's easy and distracting even though when the distraction is over he is sad and lonely. 

I too struggle with anxiety and depression, however I believe the best thing for this is self improvement. Constantly achieving small goals you've set for yourself, socializing with people, and trying new things. I really believe that this could help him, but he seems so disinterested with life and any suggestion that requires him to put energy or work into it.

I would love any input you guys could offer. Particularly from an ISFP who has trouble struggling to accomplish things/be happy with life in general.

I'm only mean to the people that are closest to me; my best friends. And this has been killing all my closest friendships for the past few years. I wonder how some of them are still my friends. Actually half of them are gone and I can only blame myself for it. Who would want to be friends with someone like me?

Now you must be wondering how I am being rude. Now that I think about it I've noticed that I might say things to feel ""better"" or to feel ""superior"". They were usually about really ridiculous things. In the middle school my best friend was getting really good grades - and then me, not so good. I couldnt ever be happy for my friend so I just said something stupid to her, like ""what a nerd, at least I have better things to do than study"" (ikr that sounds so stupid, studying isnt useless, the things i were doing instead of studying were useless). And I was always mocking all the music she listened to or all the series she watched (unless they were the same I liked). I have no idea why. I was so childish and stupid. She's not my friend anymore, what a surprise.

I've also noticed that I've been doing this to my current friends too but not that badly. I've just said some little things that might have hurted them. I heard one of my friends said behind my back that I'm a bitch. That's when I finally realized that's what I am. I'd say I'm a bit harsh with my words sometimes. Cocky, maybe.

BUT WHYyyy ??? Why am I like this? I dont want to hurt people but I keep doing it without realizing. I've been trying to minimize it but it's still there. I don't mean to be rude :( And I really care about my friends, but I dont know why I end up hurting them. I'm not a bad person

Like if I am with someone alone in a room hanging out or taking a walk with that person and talking.

So I'm looking to switch to a career that is very one-on-one. The most obvious careers in that setting is counselor/therapist/psychologist. These interest me, however they also rely a lot on me giving advice to others, and I don't know if thats my strongest area. I'm a much better listener, but maybe I can learn how to be better at giving advice.... I'd much rather learn to give advice than work in a non one-on-one career.

So can you let me know of other careers which might suit this fellow ISFP?",1477063107

isfp,"Over the past 6 months, I've lost two of my closest friends. They're both a few years younger than me (they're 16; I'm 21) and they're an INTP and an ENTP. It seems the general rule of thumb is if I don't comment on either of their negative behaviour (sometimes manipulative and controlling) then all is well. It's only when I've called them out on their negative behaviours but they paint me to be the bad guy and act as the victim. 

Most of my friends have taken the MBTI and I am the only sensor - I was wondering if it means I'm more likely to pick up on things, and maybe because it's just me, it seems I have the problem?

isfp,"Not sure if this was rightly fitting here or r/ENFP (I'm an ENFP) but my ISFP friend is one that has struggled with depression due to her life circumstances, and is only just moving out of it (although I think she phases in and out of depression, so not sure if permanently). As someone who is stubborn, she stays true to her character and as she puts it, is too lazy to compromise her personality to fit jobs, particularly retail which requires a very put on persona. I know she has gotten sacked before, and I had just recently helped her into a job to help her get moving in her life. However, due to her 'lazy' personality and work ethic not suited to retail, she had lost her job once again. I'm not sure what advice I should give her - whether she should 'not worry about the stupid job anyway' because she has another, or whether I should tell her that in life to a certain extent your job kind of requires you to lick people's asses to get where you want to go (basically just keep on everyone's good side). I want her to realise this work ethic she has is not likely to last her in the workforce, (she sort of has an attitude that makes her feel like the world owes her - eg ""The manager actually made me do so much work today, I hate him"" (the workload being that of a normal retail day). But it is also possible there is a job out there suited to her personality so she does not have to distort her raw character (but it can be argued that we all have flaws to tweak to better ourselves).

But if my crush happens to show any interest towards me, I get really anxious and I just feel the need to back off. I can't even count how many men i've friendzoned because of the anxiety. I guess it's just ""easier to stay single"" than to give them a try. And damn I had a really big crushes on a few of them. Still, I told them I only see them as a friend. I am so so so stupid, I know! But it just comes automatically

Basically I'm too nice and forgiving to people, and having this personality is letting things happen that to me are minor details, but to my family and peers I am just giving myself up too easy in trying to please everyone and make others and myself happy.

Examples: 
I recently closed on a co-op apartment, and in the process the bank lawyer messed up and sent important documents to the wrong address. In my mind, people make stupid mistakes, and the problem was being resolved by the lawyer, so I was more or less calm about the situation. My mom however was fuming at the fact that he fucked up and delayed things even further, and possibly letting personal information out in the world  (it was not). She told me I'm too nice and need to be angry. 

And at work, we had some job position changes and I had an opportunity to get a position that's a bump up from what I usually do(think lower manager upgraded to higher manager). 

However after discussed with my colleague, I conceded to stay at my usual job to maintain work quality overall at the ground level, and give the higher position to him because I know I'm a better lower manager. Other coworkers came up to me and say I was 'bullied' into staying at the lower manager position, and that I should be angry. 


So yeah, has anyone else been told they need to be angrier? I don't have it in me because that's not who I am, however feeling good about something at one time and regretting it later is getting old.

I constantly try to please people, even at the expense of my own feelings and needs. For example, I have no desire to have society considers a great career (things such as engineering, medicine, law, business, etc.). My dream is to become a librarian and artist.  Whenever I tell people this, I get funny looks, and I start to reevaluate my life goals.

I have a tendency to get strange insights and feelings about people and situations, but whenever I tell people about these insights, they look at me like I'm crazy or start yelling at me, as though they think I'm strange. I enjoy talking about various theories and ideas, but I can't seem to find anyone who enjoys talking about these things. 



































































































































I feel as though I behave like a robot. I don't express my emotions easily, and this seems to disturb most people. I get annoyed by people who express their emotions in an over-the-top fashion.

I, an intp, recently confessed to having a thing for an isfp I work with. Turns out that we've liked each other for at least a year, out of the 4 that we've known each other.

isfp,"Hey guys! I am curious to know how ISFP's are in long distance relationships because I am currently in one with one(20 M). 

We've been dating for a few months but the first couple of months were while he was in the US with me. The last month was long distance. And then I went to go visit him in his country for two weeks. 

Overall, it's been great! But the long distance was pretty hard on myself. I'm not really sure how it is on him but he seemed to handle it pretty well. When I last visited, we discussed me coming back for Christmas, which is in like 3.5 months. I asked him if he felt like he could handle waiting this long to see me and he said he was sure he could.

The only reason I am a little uneasy about how sure he is that he can do this is because I've read a ton about other ISFPs and how they crave that physical presence of their partner and how they typically express their feelings through actions rather than words. And this can cause some serious strain in long distance relationships for them and even cause them to abandon them because they feel frustrated without being able to fully express themselves. 

I believe we could close the distance once I graduate next year and can move to where he's at. He keeps mentioning how he wants to marry me and come to the US and how much he's looking forward to that. However, besides these random times where he expresses how much he's looking forward to us being together and me going back to visiting him, he doesn't really explain how he is doing with this long distance. 

I just want him to be happy and comfortable. I want to know if there's any way that I could make it easier for him to express his feelings, or if there's anything I should do to make him comfortable in this LDR because I know he feel last very deeply but has a hard time sharing or saying what he feels aloud.

Anyone who is ISFP and has been in a LDR or has been in a LDR with an ISFP and can give me some insight as to what that relationship was like or what worked or didn't work, would be greatly appreciated!",1473837913

Anyways, he's been through a lot. His ex of 1.5 years (engaged as well) broke up with him, possibly got pregnant and lost the child at 8 weeks (gives no proof), he lost his job, only has one semester of school left for his degree, moved back in with his grandparents. Him and I met a month after his break-up and hit it off amazingly. Being in the military tho for 4+ years (he hates it), he went away for the annual training. When he got back, he's a completely different person. I read around about stress for different types and found this link I think describes what's up: http://personalitygrowth.com/the-different-levels-of-stress-for-each-personality-type/

The main bit being: High Stress: Under extreme levels of stress the ISFP may no longer appear like themselves. This normally sensitive and artistic individual may become extremely factual and focused on a sense of structure and order. They may lose sight of their passions and desires in order to make more practical decisions. They may lose sight of the joys that the present moment normally brings them and instead become focused on future outcomes. They may become extremely critical of themselves and place more pressure on themselves to perform well.

He broke it off with me after getting back from training (whatever 'it' was, I don't have a title for it, but it was more than friends but not friends with benefits but also not gf/bf because he wasn't ready for another relationship yet...but it was in the realm of gf/bf.) He said I did nothing wrong, he is working on getting himself right. He won't answer calls or texts. He keeps an eye on my snapchat and facebook. He told me before the break off that he was sleeping constantly, that he wasn't sure what he wants to do with his life, if he wants to get a job or not or go back to school or not or even if he ever wants a relationship with anyone again. A lot of how he worded things made it seem like he was worried about dragging me down since he feels he's ruined his life.

The link also says How to Deal: The best way for the ISFP to get back to normal is by accepting themselves for who they are. Instead of placing emphasis on structure and planning the ISFP needs to dive into what they are passionate about. Regaining a connection with their artistic or adventurous side is important for the ISFP. They need to reconnect with their emotions and their strong sense of morality. Instead of placing criticism on themselves, the ISFP will do best if they surround themselves with people who appreciate who they truly are.

Do ya'll find this to be true?

TL;DR: ISFP lost everything in life and is back with grandparents, went away for military annual training, came back a different person and pushed me away.

Any advice? He was really into me before the training and now has flipped switches, almost 180'. He wasn't even his happy outgoing self, he was like a shell. I'm giving him time and space, but also letting him know I'm still there for him. I haven't abandoned him or rejected him. I'm an INFJ, have always supported and reassured him everything will be alright. I've never told him what to do or what not to do.

Preface / background: I am a self-assessed ISFP, though my S and P fluctuate from test to test. My Feeling is 80% strength and my Introversion is 40% strength. 

**Do any other ISFPs here have to work with ENTJs?** I am beginning to realize they may be our polar-opposites, and it may answer some questions as to why work has been stressful. You can answer this question and skip the wall of text below if you'd like ;)

More information if you enjoy reading:

I love my job. I work from home, he works from home as well. We're a part of a website/marketing company together. He's my boss, but he's also a business partner - I'm his right-hand man. He values my contribution and passion for my work, having called me ""the Nurturer"" before (I think based on another business psychology test we took together in the past). 

We get along great, have very, very deep discussions, and are close friends. However, his style of work is **very** different from mine. 

He has a ""get it done at all costs - no excuses"" type of dealing with projects. Constantly red-lining. Thrives on stress, deadlines, pressure. Can multi-task a dozen things at once. Can talk his way out of and into anything. Very practical, grounded, but with an eye to the bigger picture. He's a role model, and I perceive him as super human. 

Meanwhile, I am easily stressed and withdraw when so. Deadlines and pressure frazzle me - especially when they're not my choice but placed upon me. I can multi-task with ease but only when I initiate the tasks - if he assigns me something, it takes a long time to shift my brain into first gear. I prefer having a fluid schedule and little commitments. His way of assigning tasks and communicating is very ""let me dump this wall of text on you and you can interpret it, but hey where are we on this other task? You need to call the client later and walk through the website with them. Do you have a timeframe on the new website? If you can't handle the load feel free to hire someone to help."" etc etc. 

It's hard to put into words why I am easily frazzled. the only words I've found that I feel are true is: I enjoy projects/tasks that have a clear direction and a clear outcome. He doesn't mind assigning me tasks that require a lot of interpretation, creativity [under pressure], and guesswork.  He means no harm, but often asks why I am so stressed even when the work-load is not that stacked.

Hope all of this makes sense! Part of the therapy is just writing out my thoughts, no matter if they are organized or not ;) But the question at the top still stands: **DO any ISFPs here work with ENTJs?** Feel free to go into as much detail as you want!

Hi all. I'm interested in seeing what correlations exist between certain types and various random things, so I've created a big survey. Its a little bit long, it will probably take 10-30 min depending how fast you are at filling out surveys. I tried to mix fun questions with serious questions and so topics include pop culture, politics, art, lifestyle, etc.

I also posted this in /r/mbti, but I'd like some more varied responses (INxx types really like filling out surveys) The survey is at [this link to google forms](https://goo.gl/forms/ZDPreH7jtun7bZjH2)

It is completely anonymous, handled by google forms. After you take it it will let you see the raw results, please don't spoil these results for others. Once I have enough responses, I will perform a statistical analysis on the results and share them on /r/mbti.

If you know anyone else interested in MBTI, feel free to share the survey, but please only fill it out once yourself.

**Please don't spoil** the survey questions for others, particularly the trivia questions, I want to see what types have knowledge/interest of certain things.

*I'd like to know (without spoilers), what you thought of the survey and what additional questions you would have included. So please let me know.*",1471588010

isfp,"I was raised the oldest of an unhealthy ESFP mother. We were poor and my father was not in the picture at all and I had several short term step fathers throughout my childhood. All of us kids were so depressed and dysfunctional but did not realize that was not normal. Now I am in my mid 20s and have an amazing life thanks to my husband (an insightful INTP) who has helped me understand myself and all that I have been through. My mother did nothing for me to get to this point. Now that there are many states and several years of not speaking between us, we have built a relationship again. It is the kind of relationship where I am her best friend and we speak daily, but she does not really think of me as her child and gets to live in my spotlight in a way. She even once referenced my siblings and said ""well my kids""... but was not talking about me. Basically now her life is beginning to fall into shambles and she unloads all her marriage issues onto me to the point where it is all we talk about. Also, she occasional slips remarks about me into the conversation that are hurtful (but I do not even think she realizes it). She has never been a good mother to me, but my nature makes me crave a relationship with her that I know I can never truly have because of the lifetime of pain she has caused me and because of how toxic she is. Sorry to go on an unintended  mini rant there, but I feel stuck. My husband says I would be happier without her in my life as the years go on. 

She does show some love, but only enough to keep me coming back for more I think. Like sending cards on holidays for me and my son. We never say ""I love you"" and have not since I was a small child (under 10). Even when I do try to help her with advice, she does not listen. I feel like she is still using me, this time as someone to vent with because she knows I do not associate with other relatives that she would not want her dirty laundry to get back to.

Why invite problems into my life when I do not deserve to be burdened by her problems she created for her own life while simultaneously ruining the beginning of mine? You know how forgiving us ISFP are, but how much is too much?

isfp,"I posted this same thing earlier in the /r/entp area, but someone told me I'd probably have more luck in the /r/isfp. 

I am and ENTP female and for the past few months, I've been dating this ISFP male. He was in my country for a little bit but then had to go back all the way to his country. He left about a month ago and we scheduled for me to fly to his country to go and see him for a couple of weeks. I'm really excited but also very anxious because I'm not quite sure where we are headed. Either way I know it will be a great experience and one I would regret not going if I backed out now, but I am really confused as to how to approach this.

Overall, I'd say our relationship has been pretty easy. We would go on a lot of dates when he was here and do activities together which made it easy for us to get along. He even entertains some of my ideas/arguments and doesn't get upset. He is very kind and loving with his actions, and tells me he loves me all the time. We have been speaking nearly everyday online since he has left and he makes it very obvious he still loves me, maybe even more than he did before he left. However, I'm not sure what he wants.

He says that he really wants to be with me and wants a future with me even though it sounds impossible to him. He jokes about marrying me to so that I can stay with him and mentions how he'd want me to move to his country when I graduate (I graduate before him) and then we move back to my country when he graduates. It seems like he's joking but it also seems like he's saying these things to see how I respond, and I always entertain his jokes and go along with them saying that I would do these things for him, because I honestly would. For some reason, I could easily see myself doing a long distance relationship, but only if was what he truly wanted. I don't want to be with someone who feel forced into a relationship with me and feels held back from doing regular things in their life.

I think I'm psyching myself out after reading all these awful experiences dating an ISFP. From what I've read online with most ISFP relationships is that they tend to be very in love in the beginning, then it sort of fades away and they begin to drift to other things that entertain them. What worries me is that is what happens when the person is there with them, I feel like it would be much easier for him to get bored of me and drifts off if we were to do long distance. I know there's no way to foresee the future with him but I would love to hear anyone else's experience with a long distance relationship with an ISFP.

I really do love him but I also want to be prepared so I don't go and visit him believing there's going to be more to this relationship. At the same time, I want to do everything in my power to make this work, so I thought this would be a good place to reach out to others who may have some insight on ISFP's and relationships with them, particularly long distance.",1471377264

isfp,"I had a breakthrough in therapy this week about myself. Little things tend to upset me and get turned into a bigger deal in my head. Essentially I have some self hate and nonexistent self esteem because I was raised where having emotions and being sensitive was not allowed and would result in punishment. 




I was always being told that I was too sensitive and to get over things and would get in trouble for showing emotions or having issues from my father. My sibling would also make fun of me for it. the only person who seemed to understand was my mother who seemed to have recognized my childhood depression and my being sensitive, she didn't see it as a flaw but as who I was and loved me anyway. But despite this I learned in school and from everyone else that it was wrong so I buried my emotions and sensitivities and pretended they didn't exist. 




In high school my mother became an alcoholic and possible drug addict and I had to choose to live full time with my father to escape my mothers situation and she died less than a year after I left at 16. 




I then my first diagnosed episode of depression after moving out stopped going after about 6 months because we thought I was okay. I got to college and promptly fell apart. My mothers death didn't really hit me until then and my father became much more narcissistic and abusive and I realized I really missed her. I became suicidal and it lasted for months and I ultimately had an attempt which I hid from my father. 




I slowly have been trying to get myself back together and had this breakthrough this week that despite how much I've been trying to hide it a big part of myself is that I am sensitive and emotional and now I don't understand and know how to handle my emotions and hate that part of myself. 




I'm trying to learn to accept it and see it as a positive buts it's extremely hard for me because I don't like myself much at all because of this and other issues and don't know what to do to make myself feel better about it. I think this would be much easier if I was a woman as well because as a man it seems society says I shouldn't be this way. Which makes it even harder to accept myself. 




I thought I would reach out and see if anyone was similar or had any advice for me. For reference I'm a 21 year old male ISFP(once thought ISTP until I became more honest with myself) with depression, anxiety and ADHD and would really appreciate any advice or support you could give me.

isfp,"I think I might be an isfp though I've also gotten an ""ENFP"" result in the past. I struggle with expressing my inner energy to do something that MATTERS and makes a difference in this world. I struggle with insecurity and this need to CREATE but I'm not sure how to channel that. I like to write and always have, but not sure what to write or where to start. I'm struggling to find my purpose in this world. I used to think Christianity was my purpose and now I'm quickly deconstructing all of religion and don't feel I connect with almost all of it or believe in anything religious, but I don't know where that leaves me. 

I'm dating an INTJ Atheist, objectivist, anarco-capitalist, who's 10 years older than me and who seems very sure of his own identity and in how the world should work. He doesn't seem to have much patience for emotion, laziness, and people who are not good at what they do. He believes in individualism and believes our purpose in this world is to pursue our happiness (rational self-interest) as long as it doesn't take away someone else's free choice to do the same. He doesn't seem to have loyalty to either parents and sees all relationships as only important if he chooses them to be. He is constantly reading about current events and what's going on in the world. I'm not sure how to relate to him exactly. He's very similar to my father in some ways.

I want to create something meaningful in this world and I want to be able to understand myself. I have always tried to ask others questions about how they view themselves and the world and then try to see how that connects with me personally. I find it difficult to figure out my internal system and values. I'm not sure many time WHY I feel the way I do. If I am being controlled by someone too much, I'll run away or retreat within. I hate feeling like I must conform and yet I ask others constantly about their opinion of themselves, others, and the world in order to help me understand myself. I constantly question things. I like to be around one person or a small amount of people at a time. I feel drained if I need to talk with a big group. I feel drained trying to figure out how to build relationships with people and sustain them if I don't feel a connection with them and find it hard to read them or related to them. 

I need a good amount of time everyday for myself to listen to podcasts, read, write, reflect, but eventually I'll need to be around another person again and need physical touch and words of affirmation eventually or I'll feel depressed.

I'm not very good with planning, organization, and other administrational tasks, but am going to start teaching and will need a LOT of structure and planning which freaks me out. I'm not sure how I'll do around 30 kids every day for 8 hours. I'm nervous about that and if I'll be able to complete all the various tasks throughout the day while still engaging and relating positively with my students and teaching well. I get lost in music, excercise, thought, research (if it interests me and impacts me personally). Otherwise, I NEED a good story in order to engage in a piece of writing.

isfp,"Any The Room fans out there?

Buuuut seriously... I'm curious how similar and different ISFP's are in regards to our romantic lives and how we view relationships/sex.

I'm 22 and a virgin. 
In middle school and high school I had very low self esteem. Always wanted boys to be interested in me, but I never even had guy friends. In the 8th grade I found out someone tried to date me for a bet and I think that is what started my insecurities. I started 2nd guessing any guy that seemed interested in me until I moved out of state my junior year.

Now, in college, my self esteem is a lot better. I still have my moments, but for the most part I really like the me that I am. I'm really shy about dating in general because I feel less experienced than my peers. I've done tinder and okcupid but I can never really get into it because I always feel so weird using them and messaging small talk to people.

I always say I'm a virgin by choice if people ask, but I think realistically I'm still a virgin because I literally never put myself in environments to meet guys because if i'm not at work or in class, i'm at home. It just sucks because sometimes I just really really want to experience what sex is like.

My first kiss was when I was 18. All we did was makeout when we hung out so I eventually stopped talking to him. At the time, I didn't like that I couldn't talk or connect with him with anything else other than that. He was really into me too and that turned me off because I felt like he had no reason to be other than just off of physical attraction. 

The only time i've ever been really close to having sex was last year with this guy from okcupid. It was the first (and only) time I met him, we were high, and everything felt right but looking back that's probably because we were high. We did a lot of kissing, dry humping and the only thing we ended up having on was underwear. I'm still surprised to this day that I didn't fuck him, but he ended up being an asshole.

I feel like I've lost the focus for this post so i'll just outright list questions...

1. When and how did you lose you virginity? 
2. How do you go about dating? What do you like or dislike about it?

I'm trying to figure out how to feel more comfortable opening up this side of me by maybe learning from you guys. Feel free to add anything else your experiences have taught you about how you feel about this topic as a whole.

isfp,"We've known each other for over 3 months and he's been wonderful ever since I met him. It was quiet and subtle but over that time he made me feel important and admired and respected. It wasn't until 3 weeks ago that I realized that I had grown feelings for him that were beyond friendship.

The issue for me is that now that I realize that I ache to continue that connection beyond work and  video games I don't know what to do. I know that my extroverted nature can sometimes be overwhelming to more introverted people, though I'm definitely solidly in the middle of the spectrum, so I find myself trying to respect his space by insinuating that I would like to spend more time with him but leaving it in his hands. 

From what I've been reading today this seems like this might be the wrong approach?

All I know is that he willingly spends more time with me than he needs to, once we even spent 2 hours in extremely hot car that didn't have air conditioning just talking and learning more about his family and life. It also seems that every week we're getting a little closer.

There are times I am certain he shares my fascination and enjoyment but things are moving so slowly that I wonder if he even notices that I might like him as more than a friend. I support the idea of taking things slowly, especially after some of the bad things I've experienced, but it makes me wonder if I'm not communicating my intentions in a way that is understandable. I just like him so much that I become much shyer and subtler than I intend to be.

I also wonder if maybe he's giving me the exact cues I need to see that he's interested but I just don't see them clearly enough.

I want nothing more than to respect his space, even more so because it seems his long-term GF broke up with him two months ago because he wanted to spend more time with his friends. I also want to do what is necessary to show that if he did want to spend more time with me, through dates and the like, that I would cherish every moment that he was comfortable sharing. But, I also want to ask him if he wants to do 10,000 different things just to see if he's actually interested in any of them!

I also meaningfully tell him how much I appreciate his art and the time I spend with him as much as I can without causing myself to feel too vulnerable and he always seems to meaningfully appreciate the gestures I make.

I think, at the end of the day, my best case scenario is a relationship where I feel safe and loved but we also do our own things so I can give him the alone time that he needs. I just really want to have the opportunity to cuddle with him on the couch while we're watching movies, playing games or discussing our shared interests but I worry that admitting that out loud would make any introvert want to run. Especially in these early stages and also without confirmation that he isn't still (understandably) pining over his ex.

I don't think that I would be as antsy about things except for the fact that in a couple of weeks our schedules will change and unless he wants to purposefully schedule time that we can be together and hang out, I'm not going to see him very often anymore.

TL;DR: I'm enthralled by the idea of getting into an established relationship with a probable ISFP but I don't know where to start and I'm afraid of pushing him away. I believe he's into me by the things he says to me and his actions but I don't know how to tell for sure and I am scared to death that I'll lose him from my life when our schedules change in a couple weeks.

**Dominant for ISFP and INFP**

**Auxiliary for ESFP and ENFP**

*In this chapter, we seek to present a picture of the ‚Äúpure‚Äù Introverted Feeling that we would see if we could carefully remove it from its natural state where it is influenced and colored by all the other elements of personality. Though no process actually exists separated from the rest of the personality, the portrait that follows reflects core characteristics that are in play whenever Introverted Feeling is engaged at a conscious level.*

*Introverted Feeling most clearly resembles the descriptions in the following pages when it is in the dominant (first) position. In fact, these descriptions are based on input from people for whom the process is dominant (ISFP and INFP). But even with Introverted Feeling in the first position, what you observe will vary noticeably depending on other factors-particularly whether it is paired up with Extraverted Sensing or Extraverted Intuiting in the auxiliary (second) position.*

*In order to draw a complete picture of the ‚Äúessence‚Äù of Introverted Feeling, one must use bits and pieces that cannot individually demonstrate ‚Äúpure‚Äù Fi. Like the splashes of color in an impressionist painting, however, the bullets in this chapter, when taken all together, reveal a vivid portrait that will enable you to recognize Introverted Feeling when you see it. Knowing what the process would look like if it could be separated from other influences is the foundation of process watching, the practice that will quickly take you as far as you want to go in understanding personality.*

Introverted Feeling is a decision-making process. It focuses on the subjective, internal world of absolute personal value systems and assesses all things based upon whether they uphold the values, conflict with them, or have no impact. Fi wants to make choices and act in ways that create and maintain inner harmony.

**KEY FEATURES**

**Introverted Feeling**

* Is a subjective decision-making process that is based on personal values.
* Holds private and nonnegotiable core values deep within.
* Accepts life as it happens and embraces the individuality of others, up to a point.  
* Quietly exudes a peaceful, grounded aura.
* Does not tolerate violations of its core beliefs.
* Relates to people one-on-one through a fine-tuned sensitivity to the inner life of others.
* Seeks inner harmony.

**WHAT‚ÄôS GOING ON?**

**Introverted Feeling**

* Is the most subjective of the four decision-making processes.
* It probably originates many concepts that have come to be seen as unchallengeable rights, such as justice and freedom.
* Develops expertise in recognizing and cultivating inner harmony.
* Has a focus on the individual, not the collective.
* Is the only mental process with a truly nonnegotiable element.

**When people are using their preferred Introverted Feeling**

* Their beliefs are personal and not influenced by the established value  systems of their culture
* They may hold personal, unique versions of widely accepted cultural  values. Some of their values maybe unrelated to the existing cultural norms, and some may even conflict with them.
* They hold deep, not broad, beliefs.
* Their awareness of a conflict with their values often comes literally through gut feelings. These physical sensations signal when something is wrong or out of line with their internal values and beliefs
* Sometimes it is only when their values are violated that they become aware of the values.
* They may view virtually anything as innately good or innately bad, as positive or negative.
* They use a decision-making process that is too personal to share. * Discussing it is not generally a productive exercise.
* They need to ‚Äúfeel right‚Äù about things.
* Nurturing and protecting their inner emotional life is their primary goal.
* Internal harmony is more than desirable: it is critical to their well-being.
* Their aim is an internal life that is Utopian and not defined or limited by the realities of the physical world, such as human nature or the laws of physics.
* Comfort lies within their internal belief systems.
* They have difficulty consciously accessing their values. They may not even be consciously aware of what some of them are.
* They often have great sensitivity to internal harmony or disharmony in others.
* They are adept at knowing when something is wrong or right with others.
* Bringing their inner system of values to fruition in the real world is usually not important to them.

**FROM THE OUTSIDE, LOOKING IN**

**When we experience people who are engaging their preferred Introverted Feeling, they**

* Are outwardly very tolerant of other people‚Äôs values, as long as those values are not in direct conflict with their own.
* Have a strong sense of right and wrong.
* Hold passionately to their internal beliefs.
* Tend to be easygoing, tolerant, and flexible unless their core beliefs become involved.
* May not be able to find the right words to adequately express their values, even when these values do come to the surface.
* Show so little of themselves to the outside world that who they are may remain a mystery to people around them, often even to their spouses.
* Are often not aware of how they affect the world and people around them.
* May take very good care of people one-on-one, based upon recognizing and accepting that we all have unique needs and values
* Have sensitivity to others‚Äô inner calmness or turmoil, which often results in their forming relatively deep personal relationships. They will not force themselves on others, but they will usually know, for example, about the personal lives and issues of their coworkers. They know who is married, who has children issues, who has elder-care issues, who has relationship problems, and who is unhappy in their job; and they will often try to help them out.
* Have an essential honesty and integrity that is not usually displayed for others to see. It is who they are, part of their very being.
* Learn not to talk about hot-button topics, such as religion or politics. Their values are personal and subjective, so they may not match the culturally acceptable or politically correct values of the day. Since their deeply held values cannot be altered, they assume that everyone else‚Äôs values are unchangeable too, so talking about them can accomplish nothing but to create stress.
* Reveal clues to their real core values through the level of passion in their voice when they speak about something that is important to them.
* Make statements about decisions like ‚Äúthis feels right to me.‚Äù
* Will listen without challenging or making a judgment right up to the point where something conflicts with their values. At that point, the violator may simply be shut off, instantly excluded from their world.
* May cut off a relationship because their value system has been threatened, without giving any indication that anything has changed. The other person may not even be aware of what has happened. Will resist data that appears to conflict with their values. In such a situation, they adapt very slowly or not at all. 
* May express their values in ‚ÄúI feel‚Äù statements since their need for inner harmony is personal.
* Often form strong bonds with other people who share the Introverted Feeling preference. The bonds can be so strong that there is no great need to talk. Just being together is enough.
* Are usually very easy for others to talk to. They are very nonjudgmental, as long as their private belief system is not violated.
* Assume that everyone‚Äôs values are absolute, so there is no sense in disputing or even trying to understand them.
* Have unquestioning faith in their own values.
* Usually appear neutral on the outside. Internally they can be warm, caring, and empathetic, or they may be critical and scornful if their values have been threatened. It is usually hard for others to tell what is going on inside.
* Need to be drawn into a decision-making process when the decision has nothing to do with their values. In such a situation, they will usually not get very energized by the discussion. They may not have a strong opinion one way or another. This is often mistaken for indecisiveness.
* With multiple choices, they may care about some but not all of the options. They may say, for example, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care which restaurant we choose, but definitely not that one because they don‚Äôt pay their staff a living wage.‚Äù
* Provide the ethical backbone of any country, culture, ethnic group, or organization.
* Adapt to situations by ignoring anything that is unpleasant or distasteful unless it violates a value. Until a value is violated, nothing brings out their energy or effort to become involved.
* Will usually leave a job, regardless of the consequences, if they find that their values are at odds with those of their employer.
* Tend to be polite people.
* Influence others primarily through their behavior. They lead by example.
* Project an inner harmony and an easy going attitude, regardless of what is actually going on inside.
* Tend to be very genuine and sincere.
* Exude an inner dignity and charm: the perfect gentleman or lady.
* Often attract others to them because of their serenity.
* May arrange their personal spaces to promote serenity.

**FROM THE INSIDE**

**Paraphrased descriptions of what it is like to make decisions through one‚Äôs preferred Introverted Feeling**

* My values come from a gut level. If someone ever got me to talk about them, I would be explaining, not discussing, them. The values comes first. They are just there.
* If I had felt really strongly about the issue and felt safe to talk about it, I would have said something.
* It‚Äôs very hard for me to take a stand publicly. I have to spend time trying it on to see whether it feels right. When I do take a stand, it comes out very passionately and I am not open to debating or discussing the issue.
* As a manager, I hate personnel evaluations. I do not like to be evaluated by my manager, and I do not like to evaluate my subordinates. People are who they are and they do what they do. * Normally, I don‚Äôt feel I have a right or a need to judge them. I don‚Äôt give out many pats on the back either, because I do not need them and I forget that others do.
* I can feel when people are with me or against me.
* I use humor and sarcasm as a way to keep my values from becoming public. I need to deflect attention from this very personal place. If necessary, I may literally run away rather than reveal my values.
* I could never work for someone who has values that conflict with mine.
* My personal space is very important to me. Please don‚Äôt invade my physical and emotional space.
* Rules have to feel right to me or I‚Äôll ignore them.
* What I need most from people is affirmation, acceptance, and my freedom.
* I hate being labeled or told what I think. If people don‚Äôt check with me, they do not have a clue who I really am.
* My internal beliefs are very powerful and nonnegotiable. They just are.
* I have a sense of right or wrong and of good or bad, which usually comes to me as a physical sensation in the very center of my body.
* Paraphrased descriptions of what it is like to make decisions
* ‚ÄúGut feeling‚Äù is a literal description. When something is wrong, it makes me sick to my stomach.
* If I even try to compromise my values, my heart starts pounding.
* I often know a lot about the details of the lives of individuals in my circle, though very few people, if any, know me as intimately.
* Often, in order to avoid hurting other people, I will do whatever it takes to please them, unless it comes to the point where they are violating my boundaries. Then I‚Äôll close the door on them without even being aware that I have shut them out.
* I‚Äôve learned that I need to let people know about my boundaries sooner. I‚Äôve learned that they can‚Äôt see them and may violate them by accident.
* I‚Äôm really good at helping in an emotional crisis.
* I pick up a lot on other people‚Äôs feelings, often before they do themselves.
* I have a sense of right and wrong that I cannot explain. When it comes into play, it cannot be shaken. It‚Äôs just innate, a part of who I am.
* If someone affronts my values, I will cut him off so quickly that he will just be gone. I will probably never initiate contact with that person again. I will never say anything to hurt him but I will have lost all respect for him as a person.
* I‚Äôm an educator of adults. This is my life‚Äôs work and I approach it with a passion. Even after all these years, I still have problems when I have to evaluate projects or papers. If the students have given everything they can, it does not feel right for me to assign grades to their work.
* I am like a house with many different rooms. The family rooms are hectic, loud, and full of people. However, the rooms where I prefer to spend most of my time are furnished and decorated to promote tranquility and nurture my spirit. They are very private, and only I am allowed to go there.
* I don‚Äôt understand how people can live in conflict with their values.
* I could never do something just because someone else wants me to do it if it doesn‚Äôt feel right to me.
* I don‚Äôt like my sister. But I love her because she‚Äôs family. Loving my family is an important value to me.

**VIGNETTES**

**Scenes from the world of Introverted Feeling**

* A woman mentally checked out of an exercise because she knew there would not be enough time for her introverted decision making. She could not do the assignment. Her need to contribute in her own preferred way could not be met while she complied with the group‚Äôs mandate to complete the task. She felt that her only option was to cut herself off from the exercise in order to resolve the inner conflict.
* A woman reported that at work, group decision making often moves too fast. It does not allow time for private consideration. It is helpful if information and an agenda are provided in advance of a meeting to give her an opportunity to reflect. Even then it is usually difficult for her to participate in a way that is comfortable unless the discussion is deferred to a later meeting.
* When my son was a teenager, I inadvertently violated a deeply held value of his. He would not talk to me for the next two years.
* My husband and younger brother both prefer Introverted Feeling. When they served as pallbearers at our mother‚Äôs funeral, they wore flannel shirts and blue jeans. They just knew it was the right way for them to honor her. They had been with her every day and had never dressed or behaved like anyone but themselves for her. They were not going to change that for her funeral just to please others. It did not bother them in the least that most of my aunts and uncles, concerned about what is appropriate and customary, were appalled.

isfp,"Hey peeps :3
I would love to hear of any relationship success as well as any pitfalls you have all experienced between you and an INFJ individual!
Just some background as to why I ask.
I is a textbook INFJ guy (Middling between F and T tho) and I met this almost textbook ISFP lady recently who is pretty enchanting and seems right for me since im a 2w3 (enneagram) so I have a feeling I would get the space I enjoy (Apparently you fluffy creatures like space too :D) as well as the above average amount of affection I desire while still getting to enjoy my occasional outdoorsy explorative hobbys. My last outing with her involved alot of physical contact like her holding my arm as we walked, legs touching, body language mimicry, etc which I really liked. Last relationship I had was with an incredibly affectionate INFP who ended up being not so incredible and cheated but the intense affection was perfect for me so Im hoping I can find that affection with a heaping pile of loyalty lmao.
Thank you in advance :) ""hugs""",1469585326

Looking at the functions, I was intrigued to see we share them all, but obviously the order matters since she's in many ways vastly different from me. It may be that I'm experiencing a purely physical attraction, but sometimes I feel like there is this super complicated and deep person under that happy go lucky ISFP exterior, it's just buried pretty deep and seems to rarely come out.

isfp,"My ISFP friend has all of a sudden stopped making any plans with me. We are still friends online it seems but when it comes to getting together she always makes excuses. We used to do stuff all the time. We saw bands and went to the movies and out to eat, we talked about doing road trips. I really looked forward to spending time and hanging out. Whenever I say hey lets get together this weekend she has an excuse not to. It was her birthday a few weeks ago and she invited me over. I bought her a present and made a big effort for her, but halfway through she just got really angry about something going on in her own head and sat in silence for the rest of the day, ignoring me.

She‚Äôd start posting all these depressive quotes on Facebook about how ‚Äúpeople suck‚Äù and the world is against her etc (bear in mind she‚Äôs 30 years old).  She's just been getting into these very grumpy moods, where any little thing can set her off. The more I try to comfort her, the more she pulls away.

I am getting frustrated and upset over it but what do you do? Last time we saw each other face to face was four months ago and we had a good time and all seemed fine. I even asked if she was mad about something and she said no.

Last week we had arranged to meet up but again she cancelled last minute, then posted something on Facebook along the lines of ""that dreaded moment when someone asks if you're busy"". I was quite hurt by it because it felt like a passive-aggressive attack so I sent her a bit of a sarcastic text saying ""Okay I get the message, you silly people-hater!!"". Well, she took it badly and then deleted her whole Facebook account. Now she won't speak to me at all and I feel upset. Do you think I've blown it for good?",1468584565

Im an enfp and i broke up with an isfp a month ago. Im heartbroken and i miss him terribly much. We broke up because he couldnt handle the distance. It makes me so sad because i totally didnt see it coming and i know he loved me still so much when we broke up, and so do i. We have been through so much and my heart is hurting everyday. 

Am i silly for hoping we can get back together after some time we both have finished college so with plans to move together! About 2/4 years...

So yeah my questions are, 
1. How do isfp's cope with breakups? Do you think about them often or move on fast? 
2. How about staying friends after? Do or dont?
3. Does it take long to get over it?

isfp,"ENFP here. I have developed a relationship with an ISFP. Its like a cross between a great friendship and a mutual infatuation with one another. This all happened over the span of 6 months. We both fell fast and hard. We aren't dating, have drunkenly made out a few times, and have had huge important/intense moments with each other. 

I don't know what to call us, but being in love without the label of together and admitting it to one another, feels accurate. 

Anyhow, she often comes to me with deep information about herself and her worries for her own well being that I know she doesn't share with anyone else. I just want to know the best way for me to let her know I care and love her. 

I don't want to come across as overbearing or annoying and preachy. 

What is the best way to show an ISFP that you genuinely care? I'm also working on being more blunt with her about how I feel.

Thanks!",1467308667
isfp,"Letting out a tortured yell, I slammed my foot as hard as I could into the street sign. My shoe became dented. My toes began to ache. The sign stood unflinchingly erect, mocking my vain attempt to turn back time.

A few years ago near a bus stop, I happened to run into a girl that I used to have a massive crush on. I'm fairly certain that she liked me too back then but nothing ever came of it. We met each other at a weekly gathering held near where I lived but we lost touch when the event was no longer being held. My heart skipped a beat when I saw her.

""Molly?"" I asked. She stared at me for a few seconds before a smile started to spread across her face.

""Oh my God, Tomato91!"" She ran over and gave me a huge hug. 

""How have you been?""

""I'm good. How are you?""

""Good, good""

‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Äù

She stared back at me and I suddenly found myself panicking internally. How do I keep the conversation going? What do I say next? Do I make a joke? Should I comment on how she looks? 

Darn it, think Tomato91 think!!

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶the weather‚Äôs pretty nice‚Äù I muttered.

‚ÄúYeah‚Äù she replied.

[The weather? Really Tomato91? Really???]

We stared at each other for a few painful moments, neither of us saying anything and our smiles becoming more and more forced. After what seemed like forever she broke the silence.

""Umm, my bus is here. I need to go.""

She stepped onto the bus and my heart sank as I watched it grow smaller in the distance. I took out my frustration by kicking the street sign as hard as I could, wrecking my foot, and ruining a perfectly good pair of shoes.

I struggled with women for a long time, and up until that point I had been awkward around women for longer than I could remember. This one time stands out in my mind perfectly, though. I had the perfect opportunity to reconnect with a long lost crush and I completely messed it up. If I was ever going to get into a relationship, I realized that I needed to get better at talking to women. My social skills with women needed an overhaul.

Successfully talking to women doesn‚Äôt have to be reserved for those rare people who seem to be born confident or are more extroverted. I‚Äôll show you how to talk and what to say so that you never have to be awkward around women again.

**Be Your Best Authentic Self**

Okay, raise your hand if any of this describes you:

* People ask you ‚Äúwhy are you so quiet?‚Äù like, 10 quadbillion times
* You tend to want to leave the party early (or hide in the bathroom) and no one else understands why
* You carefully think through what you‚Äôre going to say or do before you do it
* You feel tired or want to take a nap after socializing with others for too long.

These are some of the classic character traits that describe introverts. On the other hand, if you‚Äôre the type of person who actually‚Ä¶enjoys‚Ä¶making small talk with strangers then you might be an extrovert. If so, you probably don‚Äôt need to spend your time reading this post. Seriously, r/extrovert is that way. What are you still doing here?

As introverts, we face a lot of pressure to conform to what Susan Cain calls the ‚Äúextrovert ideal‚Äù or the belief that you ought to be ‚Äúgregarious, alpha, and comfortable in the spotlight.‚Äù For a long time, I always thought that something was wrong with me because of my introverted qualities and that women would never find me attractive.

After all, one of my friends fits the extrovert ideal almost to a tee. He loves to surround himself with people all the time. When he talks to women, he is very aggressive and makes the conversation explicitly sexual very quickly. On the other hand, I have almost the exact opposite personality; I'm introverted, reserved, and gentle. After watching my friend succeed seemingly all the time while talking to women, I started to become afraid that I would have to drastically change my personality to be more like his if I ever wanted to get a girlfriend.

I tried to behave more like my friend and act more aggressive, more overtly sexual. However, I didn‚Äôt achieve any success even though I was basically doing the same things he was. In addition, I started to feel like I was being an actor by going against my own personality. What was I doing wrong?

As it turns out, the reason was that I wouldn‚Äôt naturally behave that way and women could sense that I was being inauthentic. That‚Äôs the equivalent of biting into a sour lemon and trying to convince someone else that it was the best thing you‚Äôve ever tasted

Yes, there are a lot of women who enjoy his renegade Han Solo-esque personality and would turn me down because I was too quiet. However, there are also many women who take a liking to the charming introvert and who would never go for someone like my friend.

I found myself succeeding when I behaved authentically. When talking to women, you should be your best authentic self. In other words, you should be the version of yourself that your friends and loved ones enjoy being around.

How do you behave around the people you are comfortable with and what is it that they like about you? Are you bubbly and energetic? Perceptive and down to earth? A renegade and aggressive? Or maybe you‚Äôre more of a quiet listener? When talking to women, that‚Äôs the side of you that you want to display. By being your best authentic self, you‚Äôll attract women who would be a good match for you while helping to ward off the ones that might not work out so well.

As for what to actually say to her, you should‚Ä¶

**Talk to her about what she‚Äôs interested in (and listen to what she says)**

A while ago, I was at a gaming meetup which was held weekly near my place and I met this cute, quiet girl wearing a pair of glasses. After I introduced myself to her (‚ÄúHi, I‚Äôm Tomato91‚Äù) she told me her name (‚ÄúI‚Äôm Molly‚Äù) and she started by admitting that she was somewhat of a quiet person and that she hoped I didn‚Äôt mind.

‚ÄúOh, good‚Äù I thought to myself, ‚Äúbecause I sort of am too.‚Äù

To my surprise, we ended up talking for almost an hour! She told me all about how excited she was to see Pirates of the Caribbean: At World‚Äôs End when it was in theaters and how she enjoys playing as Yoshi and how she was anxiously waiting for the next Harry Potter book to come out. She explained how she was trying to create her own RPG computer game.

All of that from a self-proclaimed quiet girl.

As Dale Carnegie wrote in his book How to Win Friends and Influence People, becoming a good conversationalist involves talking in terms of the other person‚Äôs interests and listening to them when they talk about themselves. Doing this sends the message that you‚Äôre interested in her values, attitudes, experiences, and beliefs. You‚Äôre interested in who she is as a person.

So, try to find something that she would be interested to tell you about herself. A great way to do this is by asking open-ended or ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù questions. When she tells you something about herself, listen to what she has to say. Then, ask some follow-up questions based on what she just told you or relate it to yourself (as I explain in the next section).

If she suddenly changes the subject during your conversation, typically it will be to something that she is interested in telling you about. Ask her to tell you more! 

**Talk about the things that make you interesting**

If she is interested in you, then she would probably like to learn more about you too! Just like how we looked for things that she would love to tell you about herself, she will be looking to talk to you about the things that get you excited.

Does she ask you open-ended questions about yourself? This basically means ‚ÄúI want to learn more about you.‚Äù Tell her about some of the things that make you an interesting person. Do you have an awesome job? An adventurous story? Read something unusual recently? If she asks you what your job or hobby is and you happen to do something cool, talk to her about it!

As a bonus, try to find something that the both of you are passionate about or have in common. Do you both like Katy Perry? Hate Justin Bieber? Loved the new Star Wars? Have the same hobby? One of my friends is a huge bookworm and reads 3-5 books a week. When he met his girlfriend for the first time, he discovered that she also really enjoyed reading. They spent a long time talking about the stories they read and trying to convince the other person to read their favorite book.

However, just make sure that she is actually interested in what you‚Äôre telling her about yourself. Several times I found myself talking to a ‚Äúme-monster‚Äù who dominated the conversation by talking about themselves and left me feeling bored. Pay attention to her body language. Is she hanging on to your every word? Or is she unenthusiastically listening to you talk about yourself? If she is zoning out, change the subject or let her get a word in.

**Being Successful Talking to Women**

Looking back, there are about a million different ways I could have handled it better when I ran into Molly at the bus stop. I could have asked her where she was taking the bus to (or where she was taking it from). I could have asked her if she ever finished that game she was trying to make, or if she ever got around to reading the latest Harry Potter. 

Better yet, I could have asked her out years ago when the weekly gatherings that I met her at were still being held.

I never spoke to her again after that incident. Recently, I saw her Facebook profile and she‚Äôs in a relationship with a great guy. At least, I think he‚Äôs a great guy. I guess I‚Äôm happy for her and I‚Äôd like to think that she‚Äôs happy for me too. Honestly, I don‚Äôt know if she even still remembers me anymore. I want to imagine she does.

Being able to talk to women is something we can all get better at no matter how awkward or uncomfortable we may feel. I can tell you from experience that it sucks missing out just because you don‚Äôt know how to talk to her. And I don‚Äôt want that to happen to you.

isfp,"Taken from Sidebar Function Descriptions for ISFP:

Ni as Mobilizing Function
The individual periodically needs outside advice of how a situation will develop into the future in order to know when and how to proceed. The individual takes actions without proper evaluations of their consequences which he is faced with later. As a result he becomes more cautious and attempts to slow down, but by himself he poorly sees when it's necessary to do so and when it is needed to proceed further, and thus can end up wasting his time and powers or creating undesirable result for himself. Without an outside reassurance and evaluation of his actions, encouragement when it is beneficial to proceed further (ESI) or which actions can lead to negative outcomes (LSI), the individual is inclined to either try to remain inactive and miss good opportunities or act immediately and sometimes impulsively in inopportune moments.

Anyway, I met this guy and he's totally got me in the palm of his hand and doesn't even know it. I'm not sure of his type yet, but we get along so well. Our humor is very quick and understood by each other, and our interests are similar enough to have loads to talk about. And our physical chemistry is unreal. We've been going on dates (frequently) for about a month and we haven't had the ""exclusivity talk"" yet. 

I can already start to feel myself becoming attached, which is scary for me. When I'm single I'm very independent and carefree, so it always catches me off guard when I find myself having real feelings for someone and suddenly I can't think of anything else. I'm like a mildly obsessed moron. My appetite is suppressed and so is my judgment. I want to text him about every little thing, but I don't want to come on too strong. 

The problem is not when we're hanging out. Because when we are together in person I'm able to see his reactions and gauge his interest (which seems to be very high as well). My anxiety kicks in when we're apart and we're at our respective jobs or otherwise preoccupied and my mind goes into fantasy/panic mode. First the fantasy- imagining how great we could be together, thinking of what we should do this weekend, cloud 9 type shit. Then the panic sets in when I realize we aren't even in a committed relationship yet and I'm already so into him (and could, as an effect, get disappointed at any given moment). I know he likes and cares about me, but it is still very early and I do not want to fuck it up with my hyped up emotions. 

Just wondering if this is an ISFP thing? And in any case, is there some advice you could give on keeping my cool and staying calm (when it seems impossible because he's so sweet and perfect)?

ISFPs remind me of cats. They like you for a little while, but then they walk away without warning. I'm not saying all ISFPs are like this but the one I've encountered are really bad at keeping commitments. They enjoy making plans but then they either forget about them or they just lose interest and then make excuses when the time comes. I find that the ISFPs I know don't make much of an effort to keep in touch and they're more likely to hang around with whoever happens to be there at the time. They're pretty lazy and they have no problem drifting apart from someone because it just takes too much of an effort to see them. They tend to enjoy your company for a while, but then they want to move on with new people and forget their past. I really cherish my memories but ISFP doesn't tend to think about the past that much. The worst thing is, when I tell them how I feel, they shy away and avoid me. So I don't know how to make it work with them?

Could you give me advice on how to make a friendship/relationship last with you guys? I hope I haven't offended you, I'm talking specifically about the ISFPs I've encountered.",1466702310

I have a close friend who likes to hear me sing and play music but whenever I properly try to sing for my friend my heart beats very quickly and I get so nervous. I get so nervous that I end up singing quieter and choking up. My friend always tells me I'm good, but I should have more confidence, because I'm better than what I seem to think of myself.
I even get nervous when Im recording myself. And im not even performing in front of anyone.

Suzy (Lets call her Suzy. Such a nice name) is charismatic, bubbly, full of life and has a need to experience it with all senses. She seems to be all the time in full contact with her emotions and her mood directly shows in her expressive gestures. We go so well together. We both have a good eye for aesthetics and arts, and our tastes are similar almost in all aspects of life. It took actually pretty long for us to click, but oh god when we did it just opened my eyes. Our chemistry just works. We've spent so much time together lately just eating good food, listening music, drinking wine, going for walks and smoking weed. When I spend time with her, I feel calm, easy and free.

There is this one thing though that would be a dealbreaker for a lot of people and many would see this situation of ours immoral. She bangs with my friend (Rob, lets call him Rob, Rob is a douchey name :D). Everyone pretty much knows that they have/have had sex, and by that info only people assume that they are a couple. I heard from Suzy's friend, that she's not happy with Rob, and she would rather see Suzy with me than Rob.

TBH I don't care about Rob. Even if this would ruin my not-even-that-good friendship with Rob, I would have no regrets. I'm happy spending time with Suzy. I should confront about her status with Rob though. I know that. I'm not sure how.

&amp;nbsp;


I'm a 20 year old ISFP who has spent too many years trying to please everyone, and as a result, it's hard for me to leave this friendly, funny, people-loving persona I'm into.
It comes out automatically when I spend time with people I'm not really close with, which was maybe the reason why I was chosen to be the leader of this student organization where I'm majoring in uni.


&amp;nbsp;


Being a person who wanted to gain experience and try her best in everything, I accepted it...which was the start of my downhill


&amp;nbsp;


I've been battling depression and anxiety for years. And with this new title I have, they become worse.
There would be times where I worried too much about an event we were working on and wasn't able to finish any of my assignments as a result,
where I broke down feeling not appreciated just because I was ignored on group chat,
a member verbally attacked me because I can't make decision and waste time on all the unimportant details (which is true, indecisive and perfectionist, but he could have said it nicer...)


&amp;nbsp;


In short, after few months in the position, I just found out that I hate leading and being lead, and also hate myself for agreeing to lead for the sake of experience in the first place.




I have many other things I want to do while I'm still a student. And with so many meetings, so many things to be taken care of, so many toxic people pointing out my flaws (I'm trying okay ;_;) I feel overwhelmed all the time. 


&amp;nbsp;


But I can say that I learn a lot...the hard way.
How to stand up for myself even if it means conflict, to not to give a damn to trivial matters, to procrastinate less, to identify toxic, energy-sucking people and how to deal with them. I just learned that the 'want to be in/bring peace' trait of an ISFP is not always good, because certain people can use it for their advantage.


&amp;nbsp;


I found a way to survive recently:


Use logic to filter the important things which can bother me: how I treat my friends, advice from sincere people, uni assignments, my well-being.


and the unimportant ones I don't need to take too seriously: reaction and insult from assh0les, what people in general think about me, organizational activity (it can bother me, but I don't need to do it perfectly because in the end, I realize that organization=team work. So if I leave a mess, other people can clean it; it's not only my job to take, besides, my priority is my studies).


&amp;nbsp;


It turned to be a rant...sorry, I need to take things out of my mind.


(**TL;DR** was appointed to be a leader, struggles during the period because of value clash and mental health problem and found a way of surviving that works for myself)


&amp;nbsp;


So, yeah, enough long boring backstory.
Have any of you ISFPs got a leading position (in small and/or big organization) and do well despite our nature? Can you share your experience? Also, any tips?


Feedback would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",1464364955
isfp,"Every so often I get in these slumps/ruts/phases where I don't know what I'm going to do with my life and I try to at least focus on the things that I feel matter to me the most and see where I stand with them. My thinking is that even though I don't know what i'm doing in 10 years or tomorrow, at least I know that I'm winning at the things I consider important to me right now. I think this current wave of thinking is occurring because I am supposed to graduate this fall and I don't have any clue what I want to do with the future.

For me, relationships matter the most. If there was one thing that I could wish for out of anything in the world it would be to find just ONE person that I can be alone together with. Someone that sees the world like I do and clicks with me on some crazy new level of understanding that doesn't even need to spoken. Someone that just gets it. Not even in a romantic sense, just in a person to person relationship.

I get along with everyone I know, even the people that I don't particularly enjoy the company of. I was just recently told by a coworker that I have known for years that I am incredibly likable and present myself well. I can't remember his exact words because it's super rare that someone just tells me their opinion of me and I was really excited it was even happening hahah. I just remember him saying that I was someone that couldn't be disliked and he admires that about me. (Oh, I just remembered that the reason he said this was because I had said that I tend to be attracted to weird/eccentric people because I'm boring and they are interesting. He was trying to refute that I was boring.)

So my problem is that even though I have pleasant relationships with everyone I come into contact with, I have the hardest time making the relationships deeper. I suck at initiating hanging out with people and it takes a while for me to get past the surface with others because that's usually a mutual thing. I feel like i'm a generally personal person and that is what might be hindering me? It takes a really long time for me to feel super comfortable with people. I've known one of my best friends for the best 4 years and I haven't even felt comfortable enough with her to tell her most of what's on my mind without a filter until maybe a couple of months ago. 

Maybe it's not so much of a problem, but it's something that I am observing and that I want to change. Have any of you ever felt this way and been able to break this habit or have any way of explaining why it is that this occurs? I'm not new to mbti but I am not as educated on the specific attributes and what they mean in depth.

isfp,"I'm an INFJ who is dating a female ISFP. I also know two other male ISFPs fairly well. I should have made this post ages ago because this has been on my mind for quite some time.

I constantly struggle to understand these ISFPs in my life, but mainly my girlfriend. She doesn't like to conform and is very silent. Her mannerisms are a little like mine and when I first met her I thought she was an intuitive just because of how silent she is and how much she appears to absorb everything with that confused but analytical look she often has. She is in fact an ISFP as I managed to get her interested in taking the test early on, not to mention the descriptions and cognitive functions line up and there's just no other type that she could be.

If I was to summarize my impression of the ISFP I would say the following: Reluctant to conform. Often very modest and self-sacrificing. Unsure of who they really are. Very adept at understanding what needs are being met or not met in a situation. A very strong set of senses. Sometimes prone to outbursts of inappropriate rage or an extreme sensitivity to their own emotions or the emotions of others. Sometimes prone to lying or holding back details (which can be considered lying) if they feel they can get away with something or if it's ""not a big deal"".

I apologize if this doesn't ring true for other ISFPs. This is simply what I have observed from the three that I know. Especially the tendency to tell small lies or react inappropriately. Of course, these people are likely unhealthy in numerous ways as the ISFPs that I know typically made poor decisions early on in life.

My girlfriend truly is an enigma to me. She is so just so silent and to herself, but then the next moment chatty so it's hard to really grasp who she is and how she processes things. She understands emotions greatly and seems to be quite intuitive at times, but it's like she rejects this intuition and the realizations that could follow. 

I've been trying my best to help her understand herself this past week as she claims that she has no interests and no sense of self. I refuse to believe this and so I hope to get some information from other people who share the same functions. The thing with her is that she followed the crowd for years, making very poor decisions while being manipulated and abused by egotistical ESTPs. This has no doubt left scars on her that she doesn't entirely acknowledge. I just get these moments where I desperately wish I could understand her more and it drives me crazy.",1464026424

isfp,"**What do you use? How do you use it? Is there any advice about it that you would give to other ISFPs?**

For example, I use Facebook, Twitter, LINE, Reddit, Blogger, Snapchat, IRC, and Ventrillo. For the most part, I have a very low profile on all of these things. 

I have everyone unfollowed on Facebook and only use messaging and Facebook groups. I don't follow anyone and a my tweets are private on Twitter because I use it like a lazy blog. I use Blogger to track my productivity and plans so I only use that once a month during my reviews. I use Reddit daily but mostly lurk. I rarely use Snapchat now but I keep it for when people send me stuff. I only use IRC when I'm super bored sitting in front of my computer and I use Ventrillo when I want to talk to friends or just use them as white noise as I do my own thing. 

My advice for other ISFPs when it comes to social media would be to cut down on the noise by sitting down and filtering out a lot of stuff that you feel are not worth your time. Maybe this means not using certain social media sites at all, but it doesn't always have to be the solution.

I feel like I think a lot better at night, and it's usually just me thinking about where I am in life, and just other thoughts about myself. I feel like I think about myself too much in these moments. I feel like I don't have a lot to offer in conversation at times cuz I think about myself too much, but when I'm around friends, I don't want to keep talking about myself too much.

isfp,"Whenever I read ISFP descriptions, they almost always mention that we're all very prone to be passive-aggressive or react badly to any criticism. Then there's also the thing about being impulsive and stuff, and while I've definitely had my share of being impulsive, there's always some thought to justify that action. I don't know. I think I do have all of those traits, but they were never given a chance to manifest because I had a lot of adult figures that helped me manage those traits.

&amp;nbsp;

When I looked beyond those MBTI websites and more at actual ISFPs who describe their own experiences in life and stuff, I always manage to feel such a deep sense of connection that I find it's almost impossible that I could be typed otherwise. Some types came close to I can be like, but I never intrinsically felt that those descriptions were what I was actually like. 

&amp;nbsp;

There's still definitely issues in how I how I fit as an ISFP though, like how we're described as 'kind' and 'gentle' and 'sensitive'. That doesn't sit well with me. I think what those websites forget to mention is that ISFPs won't cater to all the needs of *everyone* to make sure they're all happy and shit. I'll definitely take the time to be polite and make sure you aren't breaking down into crying fits, but other than that, I can't say I'll be bothered if people are having a bit of a bad time?  Like if they're feeling bad about getting a terrible score on their test or they had a spat with their friends.

&amp;nbsp;

I'd rather let them sort through their own stuff first, unless it's imperative that they need some support. I normally don't go out of my way to be a great or kind person. 

&amp;nbsp;

I'm also unsure about what my value system is. I have some vague notions that I am able to describe to you if you asked, but other than that, I'm not sure what these values specifically are. What anything really is to me, honestly. I must have some value system, because there are definitely moralistic boundaries that I can't cross and will never allow myself to. 

&amp;nbsp;

Maybe the reason I don't know much about what my value system is because I don't get enough situations in life to test it because I'm pretty young. And also the fact that people are mostly respectful and accommodating, so I never get a chance to define what values I have and don't have. I also don't know what a 'hands-on approach' really means to me for probably the same reasons I just stated.

&amp;nbsp;

I've always been well-organised which I've heard is unusual? I will occasionally leave stuff untidy, but only because those things didn't matter to me. It happens to be that almost everything matters to me. 

&amp;nbsp;

I also have a healthy ego. I don't trust myself to underplay or overplay whatever abilities that I have. I always keep in mind that I have a share of good and bad traits, and I'm okay with that. When someone compliments my art, I get a little spark of joy. I will raise an eyebrow if someone compliments an artwork I don't find that well-drawn or put much effort in, but I don't downplay it or deflect the compliment. Maybe I will if there's a whole bunch of compliments, because then it's overly much and I get sheepish. 

&amp;nbsp;

Criticism I can take well, because I've learnt that in most cases it will actually help. Sometimes when some harsh comment is said about me without any explanation whatsoever, I can't help but feel a prick of hurt and anger. That will quickly die out when I assess the person the comment was from and what I may have done to have warranted it.

&amp;nbsp;

Other than that, I'd say that most descriptions fit pretty well with me and I've just discovered that ISFPs can WILDLY differ from each other which I think is cool and reassuring. ",1462625425

isfp,"I'm a ISTP male and am looking for perspectives on my friendship with a ISFP female. I've known this girl for around 9 years. Our friendship started near the start of high school until our later years of university. She's told me on more than one occasion that I'm the only male friend from high school who she still talks to. Despite the length of our friendship, I would not say we're the closest of friends but I can say that we're comfortable enough to talk about fairly personal topics without problems. I know she is ISFP because she actually showed me the results of a personality quiz last year on a whim and everything I've read about it since then seems to confirm it.

As of the start of this year, she became a self-confessed workaholic. She's told me that she doesn't have time for a social life. I've felt like she's changed considerably. Previously, she would take the time to start conversations with me fairly regularly. This year, the only times I've heard from her first is when she needs something from me. Once that's done, I feel like she just disappears out of my life until the next time she needs me for something.

I recently decided to confront her after I'd had enough. I straight up asked her if I'd done something wrong for her to act this way and she replied fairly confused and assured me it was just work taking over her life. I told her that recently I felt like if I didn't start a conversation again that I felt like we would never talk again. She replied saying that that would probably be the case. She said that she didn't really start conversations or seek other people socially. After hearing this, I felt like all the other years of my friendship with her had been a lie.

We have actually done a few social events together this year and every moment with her is a lot of joy but once it's over, it's back to no contact until the next time I decide to start a conversation. From what I've read about the ISFP personality type, this is fairly standard but I just find it so difficult to believe that she had never acted that way towards me before. Most conversations recently are fairly lackluster. Most of the time, they die the moment they begin. I just don't understand how it went from us both initiating conversations to the other one year then not even an occasional ""hello"" from her the next. I see her on Facebook all the time when she isn't working and she does have meetups with friends for lunch and dinner all the time so maybe her idea of a social life is different to mine.

In regards to her friends, she is always claiming that she has no friends. I'm always really confused by this because she seems to almost always have someone to talk to. She has told me that she has at least one person in her life whom she considers a best friend. Recently, I've started to question what I am to her.

I've been really confused with our friendship for the past few months and I would like the perspective of any ISFPs who would be willing to share their thoughts. I just don't know what to do and it's been straining me emotionally for a while now.

I feel like I'm the 'J' in our relationship (even though I'm INFP) and it's exhausting always being the one to initiate plans, especially when half of the time she ends up cancelling or making excuses. I love having stuff to look forward to but she doesn't really think about the future. Sometimes she'll come up with some really good ideas and I'll get all excited but then she doesn't ever make the effort to plan/save money etc so they never happen.

Also, I don't know how to deal with her when she feels sad or she's upset about something. Usually she goes really quiet and withdrawn, to the point I think I've done something to upset her. I ask her what's wrong but she doesn't tell me so I end up leaving her alone for a while. Usually she comes back to normal in the end, but I feel like the lack of communication means nothing ever gets solved. It's hard to tell her how I feel because she's sensitive and doesn't like to discuss serious issues.

isfp,"Feelings of inferiority and superiority lead to so much pain and suffering in the world. We all possess a thinking intellect, and we all feel emotions, and categorizing individuals in terms of MBTI will often lead to feeling either better or worse off than another person. 

We all perceive with our 5 senses. All of us use intuition. We all think, and we all feel. We are all introverts and extroverts at times, depending on a number of factors, such as how well understood we are by others, and what our goals are in life. All of us are on time at times, and we are all late at times. We are all organized and planning at times, and we are all spontaneous at times. 

The core of all of us ‚Äì our eternal minds ‚Äì share all of the higher feeling emotions and knowledge of reality. Basically, when we die, we all know the same shit, and we all feel incredibly awesome. There is no pain in the spiritual plane. There is only constant humor and constant vitality. Deep down, at our core, we are all immortal and eternal, and we all share the same feelings and the same knowledge.

On the physical plane, we are all playing out roles for the purposes of evolution. We all have a unique purpose that is valuable and serves humanity in some way. We must see it this way ‚Äì the truth ‚Äì in order to evolve quickly. All of the lighter and kinder feelings are in appreciation of one another, and not in competition with each other. 

Some of us are really good at mathematics, others are fantastic doctors, some are excellent poets, and some are mechanically inclined. MBTI can be refined to see unique purpose and specialization in one another as individuals, rather than for purposes of seeing ourselves better or worse off than others in relation to personality typing. 

There is a common belief that NTs, for instance, are superior thinkers, and the NFs are too emotional and do not possess higher thinking capabilities in relation to NTs. This is entirely inaccurate. There are many NFs that engage the intellect just as easily as NTs do. Also, NTs are just as emotionally sensitive as NFs are. All individuals have buttons that can be pushed; we all feel pain from time-to-time that others may cause us. 

It‚Äôs good to see how we are all alike, rather than how we are all different, so that we can grow together psychically.  It is when we try to emotionally dominate each other that more pain is caused. Every time we look down on another human being, or look down on ourselves when we compare ourselves to another human being, we are creating more emotional pain. Our bodies are localized within specific points in space/time, but our thoughts and emotions are not. Our minds, emotional states, and the feelings we all share are NON-LOCAL in nature. When we think about another person, we share feelings with that person. Our attitude towards another person will determine what they feel from us. We must acknowledge this truth so that we can be more aware of how we think about each other. 

There really are no psychopaths or empaths in this reality. There is only expression of pain or expression of joy. When we appreciate one another, we express joy. When we cut ourselves off from other people emotionally, and possess a cold, uncaring and ruthless attitude towards other people, we are often seen as psychopaths. But what this really is, deep down, is the expression of fear, anger, hatred and emotional immaturity.

All of us are empathic and psychic. All of our minds are eternal. We can all communicate telepathically with the deceased. There is no death. We are all immortal. Pay very close attention to your thoughts and emotions, and specifically emotional connectivity, and you will quickly see that we are all telepathic. We all sense the attitudes and thoughts of each other, and when we silence our minds and listen; we can also perceive the thoughts others are having. It is quite amazing. This is all observation here. I have observed these things personally, and so have you.

We are in the midst of a psychic and telepathic revolution. The less phony we are, the more we tell the truth about what we are experiencing, and the more in control we are of our thoughts, the faster we will grow in awareness. When we are kind and honest with each other, there is never a reason to be phony.

isfp,"I was bored surfing the web today and found a cool description of ISFPs, and it rang true for me. 

Anyone else feel like they can relate to this?

ISFPs are the astute observers of life, introspective, and kind. Harmony and respect for values are so important to them.

And although trust takes quite some time to establish, once it has been, ISFPs will be solid and dependable friends.

Yes, it will take some time to really get to know the inner values of an ISFP, but the reward will be a friend for life, a friend who will proactively anticipate problems and support others.

Conversely, if trust is broken, the ISFP will walk away, no fuss, apparently passive but stubbornly refusing to engage again.

Focusing on the here and now, ISFPs will live life to the fullest, cherishing the present moment, and find real pleasure in sensory and practical activities, such as painting or handicrafts.

They need an inner balance, a kind of karma for their lives, and this means keeping things as uncomplicated as possible.

This need for balance and harmony may mean, however, that ISFPs put off a decision until the decision is made for them.

Being so present-oriented, they may neglect to plan or even try to glimpse into the near future, preferring to take life as it comes.

Planning and control are not for ISFPs; they much prefer to stay in the background doing the things they like, keeping a balance, which of course includes choosing to remain happily disorganized.",1460351052

Then afterwards, the logic slowly creeps in retrospectively and it can reappear for months at an end, similar to post-traumatic stress disorder with flashbacks and anxiety.

Is it an ISFP to act first and think later (I've read that rumination is a thing), or could this doctor be wrong?

Anyway, how can I determine which type I am?

Here's how I am under stress:
the other day I was annoyed how inefficient and half-assed some of co-workers are and how i'm constantly cleaning up after them. Anyway, in the moment, I projected my feelings of annoyance/irritation towards them and later (a day later) realized that I probably should have been more professional in how I handled the situation, but instead, I resorted to snubbing my coworkers and being very, very direct/blunt. I was gonna say I should've been more diplomatic, but they honestly don't deserve that. Idk. Honestly, 95% i'm internally salty/annoyed/irritated. I've just recently realized that I should maybe not consider other people's feelings, but consider not making my feelings their issue, I guess. I realized that while I'm a hard worker, I shouldn't let the inefficiency of my co-workers affect me.

tl;dr
I need to stop making my feelings other people's issue regardless of their work ethic.

isfp,"Hey all,

ENFJ bi guy here who has a hardcore crush on another ISFP guy, who I know isn't entirely straight either. The reason it has become ~hardcore~ is that there have been countless signs in the past couple months that indicate a reciprocated attraction. Since determining he is an ISFP, these signs come through actions moreso than words, which I've read is characteristic of you guys. For example, we both really are into shows and love to dance, and have been to a few together. Whenever we are in a large group dancing I catch him glancing at me and it feels like I'm his only audience. We both get in the zone and he subtly makes sure I'm watching. Also we both go to the same gym on our campus and whenever we're there there together I catch fleeting glances from him well. (Y'all try to be sneaky but it's obvious sometimes) 

On top of all this, I feel a strong connection with him (the feeeels). When we're both in the same room its almost overpowering. ENFJs have a gift of being able to quickly pick up on and empathize with the feelings of others, and man oh man you guys have a lot of feels. Its like I'm being unloaded on when I'm around him. I can't make sense of them all though because he (and yall ISFPs in general) mask them superbly well...which poses a frustrating yet intriguing challenge for me in trying to interpret them. 

So what I'm asking is am I onto something here or am I just going crazy? Do any of you guys express attraction to another person subtly through action while being emotionally guarded? How should I move forward without coming off as too intense (which is hard AF for us ENFJs) Any and all advice / similar experiences would be greatly appreciated! :)

There was one point in my life where I would get lonely.
But at the point I am now where I'm almost 30, I welcome the right company, but I never really compromise for company that doesn't really vibe with me.

I actually prefer being by myself for the most part.

I never get bored. I always have something I want to do or be working on.
I'm a total homebody, I have a fair amount of games, comics, manga, books that I enjoy playing/reading etc. I also enjoy working on different artistic projects on photoshop.

But the point being, I really value my alone time. And being with too many people, or the wrong people is very draining and I don't get much out of it.


Does anyone else here identify with just enjoying alone time and doing your own thing? I find it so odd how some people feel that they always need to be talking to someone. I enjoy texting, because it still allows me to get work done, but I just don't crave human company as much as most people do I think.

Despite my acceptance of other's opinions, I always seem to rank myself higher (not in social terms, kinda more like opinion terms - I dunno if that makes sense) than, maybe, 95% of the people I meet.

isfp,"I'm an ISFP and I really really like other people (mainly celebrities) that seem to have ISFP qualities.  For example, musicians:  I have seen Lana Del Rey, Marina Diamandis, and Lorde all typed as ISFPs before.  To me, they also seem like ISFPs.  

My favorite band is Coldplay.  They make me feel a certain way idk.. but I don't know if they could be considered all that ISFP or not.  I also like listening to Lana, Marina, and Lorde; and although they aren't necessarily my favorite musicians, I do like them a lot and I feel almost ""connected"" to them. 

They seem very similar to me and I relate to their music.. It's almost like their music is the type of music I would make if I wanted to be/was a musician.  

Maybe I'm just really sensitive to when they use any Fi/Se/Ni/Te at all, and less sensitive to when they use other functions, so that they therefore seem more ISFP to me than they seem any other type??  I don't know.  Thoughts?

(forgive me if I should be posting this on, like, PersonalityCafe instead of reddit..)

I'm not the best at describing functions on paper, so some of these are NOT MY WORDS, but all 3 (Lana, Marina, Lorde) all seem to:

-""SeNi: explore the emerging experience, internalize the   meanings//SeNi: the substance of experience is observed as it emerges from the environment, so the ideas of things are taken from an individual arsenal of subconscious impressions (http://www.erictb.info/temperament2.html)

-Have dominant Fi.. very tuned in to their own feelings.  Most of their songs focus on this, even if it's subtly.
-Lana Del Rey has also kind of created an image.  Not all her songs may come across as being sung by an ISFP (although many do) but to ""orchestrate"" and create a whole 'aesthetic' like that is very ISFP, or at least very like me.  The sensory aspects of her songs really evoke a particular feeling.

-Marina often mentions her selfishness.  She has said her songs are often about an exaggerated version of herself.  The way she sings about her selfishness is very much like exaggerated introverted feeling (Fi) turned a little negative.

-All demonstrate an ""individualized approach to people and a more objective/collective approach to things"" (http://personalityjunkie.com/04/ti-fe-fi-te-function-pairs-type-biases/) 

-Their music is personal, filled with objective observations, evokes certain feelings, sounds pleasing to the ear, and is filled with subtle insight.

-Their music is still different from each other, though.  Lana creates beautiful music that makes you feel something.  She paints pictures with her songs.  Marina sings about her take on her own experiences.  How she feels about herself and situations she has been in.  Lorde's music is slightly cynical.  It's about her internal view of the world.  Her feelings and how they compare to the world around her.

I'm terrible at explaining all this, ha.. sorry.

((This was supposed to be a post about whether any of you other ISFPs really like other ISFPs, like I do.. but it sorta turned into more of a post about whether you can agree with why I think 3 particular people are ISFPs........This is so scattered I seriously apologize))

Anyways whenever say my INTJ mom and ISFP brother fight (with INTJ mom meaning to do good but coming off patronizing) they just pick at each-others buttons and it just escalates.  ISFP then blows a fuse and shuts down.  My dad and I both have empathy for them but think they're one of the same (probably has to do with functions).  I don't know if it helps but I think my father has the same functions as me Ne-Fe-Si-Ti but just not the same order as me.    Whenever my dad approaches my brother on the same subject while he doesn't open up anymore it's not as explosive, but still nothing seems to get to my brother ISFP.  As an ENTP I feel like I'm stuck in the middle playing diplomat in a madhouse.  Frankly it's stressful.  I get the feeling that my brother is very sensitive but he doesn't show any emotions or share anything which frankly turns the house upside down.  We're all adults, I'm moving away soon but he can't move out yet as he doesn't have enough savings.

So I guess my question is how about how you relate to INTJ's especially if they happen to be your parents.  Is this common?  How can I help as an ENTP?

     I've posted before about my friendship with an ISFP, but now I'm very confused. She not only said a few days ago that I'm one of her closest friends (I've posted about being her confidant in the past, but I seem to have lost that role as of late) but also that she's been avoiding me because she feels like I have feelings for her, and she likes me as a friend, so the situation of doing things with me makes her uncomfortable, though I apparently don't personally do anything substantial to make her feel uncomfortable, if that makes sense. I see her pretty much only as a friend, and said so, but the reality still stands--we used to spend entire days together and do fun activities together on campus, but not at all anymore.

(i)There were two sides to the office - one was a lot smaller than the other, I was in the smaller side. 

(ii)Now that I look back, 100% of the interns on the smaller side were introverts - that number is about 70-80% for other employees. 

(iii) R&amp;D department was on the smaller side along with two other teams and Susan Cain has mentioned t in her book hat companies fill their R&amp;D departments with introverts.

Still, she suffers through crippling depression. It's incredibly difficult to watch, and at times it can get a bit frustrating. I'm a fixer and problem solver. I want to see her happy and energetic like she used to be. And I just know that's what she wants too. But lately, despite being sweet and loving, she's been sleeping a lot... like.. 11+ hours each day, and has had an extremely tough time doing what she wants to, instead choosing to spend all day inside playing MMO video games the day after excitedly talking about a new artistic pursuit or workout regiment she wants to start. I'm happy to be a good husband and provide for her. But it's just so difficult to see her struggling against her own weight. And even more difficult to find my encouragement can come off as annoying or bothersome to her sometimes.

To make matters worse, communication is a challenge; You ISFP's are so damn silent! In addition... ISFP is a type that I just don't understand at all. You guys love creativity, but absolutely despise feedback on a deep level. And with a mindset that so heavily rewards instant gratification, how are you ever supposed to deal with depression as an ISFP? Fighting depression requires some self discipline and delayed gratification. A trait that I find this type struggling with... And I also find that ISFP's take some odd joy in doing the exact opposite of what you want them to... Even when you're just trying to help.

I just want to learn whatever I can to be a better partner.  The start of our relationship was actually pretty rocky since she'd been dealt some pretty major hurts by the guy she dated previously (he was controlling, a manipulator, and a cheater).  ...but I'm none of those things and just want to see her blossom.

We worked through some of her hurts and fears, have established decent communication and we're at the point where we can talk, snuggle a bit, and enjoy activities together, whether that's just watching a show, or cooking something, etc.

A few questions:

1. **Opening up** - I read that ISFPs like to show their affection through actions rather than words.  ...but I *need* to hear it.  We're early in the relationship, but she seldom ever affirms me.  She doesn't point out that she liked something I did or said, she just takes it in and holds it inside, which leaves me completely in the dark and feeling like she's indifferent to me.  How has your communication evolved as your relationship has endured?  I think she really values me, but she doesn't express it verbally, so I end up feeling like chopped liver.
2. **Common Interests** - What are some things you enjoy together?  She seems to love cooking, reading, nature and soccer.  What are some other things we might enjoy together?
3. **Conflict** - She's playing soccer, which she loves, but she has back problems and knee problems  (multiple surgeries) and it's really, really unwise for her to keep playing such an aggressive sport given how at risk she is for serious injury and how much life is ahead of her.  I don't want to control her and haven't tried to, but I'm really concerned for her health.  She had shooting pains in her back yesterday (which indicates she is getting nerve damage) and hasn't yet gone to a doctor...  ...one of the downsides of living in the moment as ISFPs like to do is that you guys don't always think ahead to see the effect your current actions might have down the road.  I'm concerned that she's so focused on enjoying soccer in the now that she's not considering the life-long debilitating impact that what she's doing might have on her body.

isfp,"I am afflicted with a sense that i am not the person i want to be. it‚Äôs as though there‚Äôs some way i feel very strongly i should be, but i recognize that i can never be that way. it‚Äôs like my feelings, thoughts and behaviors are not quite right, don‚Äôt line up with something deep inside of myself.

this is not a passing feeling. I‚Äôve felt like this for many years, starting from when i went through adolescence. and in fact, the exact reasons i‚Äôve had for not being satisfied myself have changed over time. there have been months when it‚Äôs been because i felt incapable of relating to other people, days when i‚Äôve been uneasy with my musical abilities, years when i‚Äôve wished i didn‚Äôt have any secrets i was ashamed of. I've always been sensitive--easily hurt and sensitive to other people's emotions--and when i was growing up, no one really knew how i was feeling most of the time. Instead, my intelligence was valued more highly than other qualities i have. maybe that's when the sensitivity got distorted into unease with myself.

it‚Äôs lonely, because no one else can feel how this feels, though who knows, maybe some people can relate. it feels incurable. people have certain qualities and auras about them that make them seem unique and give them a sense of having a soul. I‚Äôve always been very conscious of that, and one of my favorite things is to try to understand what makes people themselves, and how that shapes their experiences and relationships.

so i, like everyone else, have certain qualities and ways of being a part of the world, roles I fit into, an aura, a soul. As I get older, who I am has come into clearer focus. I‚Äôm not creating a person, but just understanding the one i happen to be.

i wish i had the strength to think for myself, to think about the world in  my favorite songwriters, like elliott smith and nick drake, are really fantastic at understanding the human condition, at painting human emotions in all their complexities. I want to make music that moves other people the same way I‚Äôve been moved. but instead, it seems like none of the insights, beauty, and catharsis i find in the songs i love are accessible inside myself. i can only seek them out in the words of others; i can‚Äôt come up with them myself, though i want nothing more than to be able to. that‚Äôs how it feels. like either the things i want to express are locked in my chest and i don‚Äôt know how to unlock them, or they‚Äôre not there at all. it doesn‚Äôt stop me from writing songs or trying to express myself, but it does stop it from being satisfying. 

i‚Äôve associated this sense of not being who i wish i were with the MBTI, for as long as i‚Äôve been exposed to it, which is something like 8 years now. it sounds insane, maybe, that this test, which is only a really rough outline of human personalities, could be a way for me to feel the pain of not being who i want to be, but it gives form to what would otherwise be a totally vague sense. like, i can say ‚ÄúI wish I were N instead of S‚Äù because it gives me a way to explain what i couldn‚Äôt explain otherwise, about who i wish i were but can‚Äôt become because in some ways, deep down, people are just the way they are and there‚Äôs no sense trying to change those fundamentals. fundamentals like how i get too caught up in the moment and don‚Äôt see the big picture a lot of the time, don‚Äôt see opportunities and possibilities and don‚Äôt have the kind of creativity that allows people to create worlds like the ones we lived in when we read our favorite childhood books. I used to wonder a lot about which type I was, as i tried to understand myself. now I definitely identify most with ISFP, but I wish I fit a different type‚Äôs description.

i wish there were a way to fundamentally change who I am. this feeling is the source of most of my sadness, and when i want to die, it‚Äôs only because i don‚Äôt see any other way of not being myself. of course there are solutions like figuring out what my goals in life are and following them, improving myself in the ways that I can, and being the best version of myself I can be, but though i've made a lot of progress in doing all of those, that progress hasn't made me feel much more at ease with who I am. and it's been years of trying (though definitely not as hard as i would if i didn't feel defeated by this whole problem in the first place).

I know this is hella long-winded and might sound defeatist, but i don‚Äôt know where else to discuss this, since it relates to the MBTI for me. I don‚Äôt know if anyone will read this fully, but if you do, thank you for taking the time. It wasn‚Äôt easy to write about this.",1450701531

Because I'm an introvert,  I tend to think about them so I don't tend to react in ways I'll later regret. Sometimes I miss the old me because I would say my passion and artistic creativity was stronger, but I think the new me makes better decisions for myself and others.

That's all I really have to say about it. I was just hoping there were similar people out there in the world.",1449777112
isfp,"Hello /r/isfp,

So I have two ISFP siblings, both of whom laugh at my face and find it funny, but one in particular who tends to laugh at it constantly whenever we talk. I always ask her why she finds it funny and she always says: ""It's cute!"", which I've tried to understand the meaning of but she couldn't explain.

I find this strange because most people, even close friends, find my resting face and cold tone of voice intimidating and scary. So does this happen with any of you who know INTJs IRL? If so, what causes this?",1449718590

isfp,"I've been close with a number of ISFPs, in fact my mother is one, and they used to be my least favorite type to be around as an INTP... always too touchy and sensitive about their values, with weird aversions to things and preferences with a knack for showing disgust at ridiculous things. Kind of critical, and they're old opinions anyways.

But then I realized that some of the ISFPs in my life were the exact opposite- okay with anything that few other people would be okay with. Accepting of their environment and capable of putting up with things that I would never put up with. Some ISFPs I know have been totally cool with unfaithful partners as well, and my ISFP roommate can just let things go, whatever they are.

isfp,"I've asked for advice on how to interact with an ISFP friend of mine a few times when I wasn't sure how she was thinking--and now I'm back. She has opened up to me on a very deep level, revealing a lot about her past. But, unfortunately, she doesn't spend a tremendous amount time with me unless it is to share her problems. She has been very flirty with one guy on the floor, but admitted that she doesn't tell anyone what she has told me because they ""don't need to know."" Is that an ISFP tendency or just me providing an ear she has been increasingly willingly to use? And, perhaps most importantly, what does this tendency show about her perception of /feelings towards me?",1449582856
isfp,"Of course I don't mean ACTUALLY set anything on fire. I mean, when you get upset, does it really blow up in your face? Do you say tons of things you regret? Do you feel like just throwing your hands up in the air and throwing things away?

As an ISFP, I can definitely do this. I am a really sensitive guy, but if I get upset, I feel really hurt, especially when I feel like I've been handled with insensitivity or ignored or something like that. My brother's friends were making some pretty innocent jokes about my love life and I blew up about my girlfriend's rape and just completely buzzkilled the conversation. And now I wish I had kept her secret because she doesn't want it known. It just came out.

I also got unreasonably pissed at the girlfriend for being annoyed at me trying to talk to her while she was reading the news. I get it, people don't like to be interrupted, but she didn't handle the situation that delicately (she rarely does with such things). So I got pissed and ignored her back for a long time, all the while knowing I was being immature and unreasonable, but I couldn't help it.

I just wish I knew how to handle these situations better. Anyone else have the same problem?",1449259106

There are aspects in both ISTP and ISFP I share, and also some I completely disagree with. For example, I am highly conventional and do not spend much time thinking of new ideas. However, I admire aesthetics and am very sympathetic towards others. And yet, I do not enjoy nature and am usually not quiet or reserved. I am not an artist or a mechanic, in fact I am a mathematician and computer programmer with a love of history and foreign languages, combining both the literary and the engineering.

I have two years left but now I realize that this isn't my passion and I have no enthusiasm for it. I recently discovered that I'm an ISFP and my struggles with academic environments makes so much more sense now. I grew up with people convincing me that I SHOULD be organized and I SHOULD follow the school system and get good grades to get a good job and make a lot of money. It sounds nice, but the idea doesn't appeal to me. Sure, money is important, but is it worth studying a subject and getting a job I'm not interested in? My fellow classmates are always asking questions in class and showing their interest in engineering projects out of school, but I don't even care. I feel like I only go to school to pass my courses with the bare minimum when I have no interest in engineering at all. I feel like I have to do it for my parents because they put so much money into my education, and I wanna make them happy, but what about my happiness? Whenever I have an assignment or a project I feel miserable and I'm bitter about doing it because it feels like an extra chore or a waste of my time. I don't know how I'm gonna force myself to finish my last two years of school. I'm not a dumb guy, I just feel like I have no more enthusiasm or gas in the tank to finish this program I have no interest in. I've been getting by with minimal effort and just relying on my natural ability so I can pursue my interests outside of school, but I'm at a stage now where school is difficult and I actually have to try now, and I can't bring myself to do that. I lose so many marks just because I have this mental block stopping me from doing assignments or fully preparing for midterms/ finals. To put it plainly I JUST DONT CARE. I've been this way since high school, and I thought something was wrong with me, but I read about ISFPs and struggles with academics seems like a common thing. I'm just so lost and I don't know what to do. Please help me. Any advice, anything is appreciated. How do my fellow ISFPs get by in the world.",1448402904

isfp,"So I was wondering how fellow ISFPs meet girls or even start relationships in this day and age. I know the dating game favours extroverted types, and for introverted types I see the same advice everywhere: Join clubs/ volunteer. Problem is, if I'm doing that for the sole purpose of meeting someone, I feel ""fake"", because I'm not doing something I particularly enjoy. As for hobbies, I'm very active but I'm a bit of a loner. I like going for hikes in the woods, working out(not at the gym, but alone at home or outdoors.), parkour at parks or college campuses, and I train martial arts. I do go to university and study civil engineering, but there's mostly guys in that faculty, and I barely go to class as it is. In high school I went to an all guys private school, and I never went to many parties because I was a quiet introvert. My parents were also really overprotective and controlling when I was younger, so the few girls I managed to meet I didn't have the freedom to hang out with them as much. I did like a girl ONCE 4 years ago, but it was random chance. We volunteered together and we seemed to connect effortlessly. It ended badly, and I never really recovered. She left me with trust issues. After that I focussed mostly on myself and didn't meet too many people. I've also noticed that when I do randomly meet a girl and there's an attraction I automatically assume she's playing me and I look for reasons to distrust her or break it off before it even starts. The bottom line is, I barely meet anybody, and I'm only attracted to a small percentage of those I do meet, and when I'm attracted, it's very easy for me to lose interest cuz of trust issues. Since possible girls that I would like have to be narrowed down, the logical solution would be to meet more girls so the pool of narrowed down candidates is larger, which would in turn help my chances. If that makes any sense. If I can't do that I feel like I'm destined to die alone some day. I know people say to be happy on your own, and I've been doing that for years, but now I feel like I'm missing something, someone who I can share myself with and open up to.

Sorry for the long rant. I know it started off as a question but maybe I just needed somewhere to vent. I was just wondering if anybody else here feels the same. ",1448052778

Do you know of any good stereotype free descriptions of ISFPs?

//*read this if you want. It isn't entirely relevant to my question*
I'm mainly asking because it doesn't seem like any type fits me. It seems like I've become more logical in nature as I've aged (mainly since 20 or so) as opposed to it being how I naturally am. I'm generally aware of my feelings, but I have felt empty for quite some time now. I can't even answer ""how was your day"" honestly. Friends perceive me to be an INTJ in some ways due to how I act around them, but anyone I'm not comfortable with would probably describe me as shy (true), timid (mostly true), and innocent (weird).

    I'm a male, and  I've been pretty good friends with a female ISFP for a few months now, most of which have been very good. She has often come popping into my dorm to just to do work or just hang out, and we share so many common interests it's honestly hard to find something we don't have in common. 

Two nights ago into the following day, we had very deep conversation in which she opened up (unprompted) to me on an entirely new level. She later said I'm the only one she opens up to, and we spent a few hours talking and walking around campus on a beautiful day. Later, however, she said she couldn't go to an event because she was uncomfortable with me. Today, I woke up to a text message asking if I could honestly answer a question: ""what are your feelings towards me?""

I'm a 24yo female who has been in a relationship with INFP for four years. Our different approaches to socialising cause tension between us and this is the primary problem that we have, it comes up again and again and again. He's a lot more easygoing but he constantly wants to appease his friends, I on the other hand hate the idea of staying out just to keep someone else happy or moving things around just to suit other people. I'd rather do what suits me but I can compromise on this and often do. I often feel like the bad one in the relationship for wanting things another way. Other than this, we get along very well. We have a lot of fun together, great conversations and I can't think of a better match.

isfp,"Hi, this is my first time posting in r/isfp. I first found the MBTI test last year and got INFP, INTP, ISFP, and ISTP. I found that the ISTP and ISFP were the most accurate type profiles for me, before narrowing myself down to an ISFP by learning the different functions. A bit of background on myself:

I'm Canadian, a 22 y/o male currently going to university in Kelowna studying engineering. Right now I'm just trying to get my degree and I guess I'll figure out my plan for jobs/ careers after I graduate. I currently enjoy playing video games (strategy games, first person shooters) on my free time. I'm also training martial arts at a local mma gym 3-5 days a week on top of my studies for two years now. I'm really into working out and fitness and I keep myself in top shape with constant exercise/ martial arts training. 

Anyway, I was just wondering if any other ISFPs noticed this about themselves. Here it is:

I find that I have a different persona depending on who I'm around. No matter what the case is, I almost feel as if I'm putting on an act for the different groups of people and social settings in my life. I mimick the language/ vocabulary and habits of the group I'm ""working on"", and I try to interact with everyone to learn their sense of humour, habits, likes/ dislikes, and more so I can adopt some of those traits and fit in better. It's not always intentional, and it can feel like I'm on autopilot. I can be the quiet kid who just listens and contributes to the conversation occasionally, but sometimes I can be the life of the party in front of complete strangers, which doesn't seem very ISFP like. Some people see me as antisocial and my body language makes me look unapproachable and intimidating I've been told. Others have told me that I come off as very sociable and charming, to the point of being mistaken for an extrovert. I know people who see me as a kind hearted spirit who wouldn't hurt a fly, and other people from my past who remember me as some badass who wasn't afraid to throw down. It almost feels as if nobody really knows the real me, and I'm just exerting energy to put on a performance and play my part. The thing is, sometimes I play my part so well I become it, relative only to the group of people who see me that way. It no longer becomes an act, but it becomes who I am in that certain social circle. But when I move to another group, I adjust my persona accordingly. As a result, I've lost touch with quite a few people I considered close friends over the years, which is probably due to my laziness when it comes to maintaining friendships/ acquaintances, but also because I can't maintain my ""fake"" persona for too long. I really only have a few constant friends in my life, because I'm always moving between social groups. Although I can be outgoing and personable, I know for a fact that I'm an introvert and not an extrovert because I go through long periods of isolation and a need for alone time. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I don't really have a sense of self identity. Some people are consistently known by others, including strangers, as being ""like this"" or ""like that"". Any description or interpretation of me can vary greatly, almost as if I was a completely different person depending on the group I'm with.

Any other ISFPs experience this?

tl;dr: I feel like a social chameleon who can ""blend"" into my surroundings and camouflage myself so nobody knows the real me, to the point that even I don't know who I really am.

isfp,"First time posting here and I need some advice about how/if to ask out a good friend of mine. We are college students that live in adjacent dorms, and she comes and sits in my room with me for a relatively substantial period of time every day to do work or some other activity. We usually go out and eat alone together 3-4 times a week. These haven't felt like dates, but I've noticed recently that, rather than sitting directly across from me, she is now sitting beside me (though oriented towards me, strangely). I openly admit that I may be reading too much into relatively trivial changes in behavior, but I've noticed that the change was accompanied with her walking/standing/sitting much closer to me than she has previously. We often joke around and have what some may call a flirty relationship, but we have also talked about our own personal demons with each other, as well as heavy topics (depression, relationships with family) that wouldn't be discussed among acquaintances. 

I am totally content with being friends with her, as I believe that we have a strong bond, but tonight after dinner she made passing comments about how certain actions ""turn her on,"" making me wonder if I've been missing something. Asking a few of my close friends yielded different results--that I'm so friendzoned she is fine telling me what she finds attractive and to be a turn-on, or that she was basically giving me a road map.

I'm clueless. I've never been in a relationship. Thoughts? Thanks!

so I just found this subreddit today and I have been reading up on the Myers-Briggs test and the ISFP personality pretty much the whole day. It took me about 19 years to find out about said test and another year to finally do it and look into my personality. It is astonishingly comforting reading threads in this subreddit and reading about the ""definition"" of ISFP type personality.

I wasnt self-confident about myself for the better half of my life especially in the last 6-7 years. Not saying that finding this subreddit instantly gave me confidence, but I am just really happy that i found it and now can somewhat describe what kind of a person I am.

After this long introduction, I wanted to ask you, how you found out about this test and how you reacted/how it may have changed your life.

Anyways having super hard time in college algebra math classes. 

It's so frustrating because I really don't wanna do any of it, I have absolutely 0 tolerance for math. I have a hard time concentrating for more than 5 minutes, without music on ....... But when I do have music on I'm not concentrating lol.

I'm probably going to fail my math class this semester. And after this financial aid goes away and my parents will have to pay out of pocket............

But I don't think I will pass even if I get another chance, math is too stressful for me........

I don't know if this is all ISFP's or that I just have low IQ ,lol.

But I'm really not stupid at all.......  I'm actually pretty smart when it comes to decision making and thinking for myself and doing things I love etc......... I think the main problem is my tolerance for math. I just can't tolerate any of it........

But  the thing is that I'm scared to give up college, because I fear that I won't be able to make a decent living........ I don't wanna live in an apartment for the rest of my life......... My parents are middle class but they can't take care of me for the rest of my life......... 

Is there any other good paying jobs that isn't blue collar labor based? That accepts people without college degrees?

Maybe a manager at Walmart, Kroger?Do they require a college degree? I'd would love to be teach instrument lessons and other things music related ? But I'd imagine it wouldn't be consistent ...........
