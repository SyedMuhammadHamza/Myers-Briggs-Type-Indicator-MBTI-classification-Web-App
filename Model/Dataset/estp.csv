estp,Yeah I’m honestly surprised that mullets and mustaches aren’t included in the MBTI pages as commonly found on ESTPs. That’s probably a more accurate stereotype than dumb jock or adrenaline junkie for sure.,1617462702
estp,"Yes I tend to be very extreme with my interest I go from having it constantly till when I’m tired of it I can’t go back to it. I just got back into the groove of watching anime and have started sketches on my favourite character from this anime.

estp,"Very general tip from management land, but it's forgotten so very often: Make sure that it is and stays a ""your team against the situation""  kind of teamwork, and doesn't turn into a ""who comes up with the best idea"" arms race when you are dealing with personalities that are very far removed from your own. It doesn't matter who came up with it, what matters is that a solution gets implemented, it does not have to be your own solution either.

So to answer your question: calling people out on their faults is NOT a productive way to go about it, especially when they never asked for feedback. It makes you look arrogant AF. The goal of this teamwork is NOT to ""fix"" this 16 year old boy behaving like a 16 year old boy, the goal is to get shit done. Don't try to fix people who did not ask for it and aren't very close family or friends.",1617429105
estp,"My ESTP experience is limited to my partner, so if anyone sees flaws in my advice, please speak up.

Generally speaking, my partner takes feedback well. But if it’s regarding something he’s resistant to, he’ll react as though he’s being attacked. So it’s good to mention something you need to improve about yourself while you’re telling him what he needs to improve on. Or if he criticizes you in retaliation for a perceived insult to him, you should respond as though he’s giving genuine feedback. 

Basically, if you make it clear that you expect him to be mature and receptive, he’s more likely to live up to that.",1617425540

estp,"Strengths of Se- Direct (through action, anyway), concrete, literal &amp; objective, hands-on, can make decisions swiftly and surely (when not using Ti—Tiing stuff can take forever), physically engaging, good awareness of our surroundings plus a good understanding of how we fit into our surroundings. We’re very down-to-earth, or at least exist on the ground-floor of life—it can be fun to pull intuitives down to a ground-floor reality &gt;:) We’re intensely connected to our environment, and typically notice small changes in it. We’re arguably the best at living “in the moment;” I imagine people practicing mindfulness would be very jealous of our natural-ability to focus on the sights and sounds directly surrounding us.

Struggles- Impatient, overzealous, fail to realize the scope of our proposed solutions, don’t think of/don’t care about the consequences of our actions, planning, insight and foresight lol. I feel like our “grips” are the times where we have overindulged our Se for so long that the inevitable moment where we realize the consequences of our actions have caught up with us, or will catch up with us, brings us great turmoil. It’s the big, “Oh my god, I have been severely fucking up for some time now” moment. Obvious to some others—not so much to us.

How we use them together: While we are so intensely connected to the moment and making decisions based on concrete data available to us now, this does not mean our Ni isn’t there and working; it is. Where an Ni dom would project an answer or future prediction very, very far out based on what their Se sees now, our Ni is working to support our Se by telling us what is likely to happen *literally immediately next.* An Se dom is most likely type to notice that something is about to fall or roll off a table, and therefore also be the quickest to react.",1617395584

estp,"I agree with you on a lot of this except for the last paragraph, I think Jake’s whole friendship with Judy is a result of Fi and INFJ subconscious where he wants to see the best in people and is more concerned with a connection and a friendship than the case itself which in this instance comes secondary, this is especially shown with Rosa deals with him, it’s fully based on his usefulness to the case and not the individual",1617375784
estp,"I've been thinking about this, I think a lot of people really disregard Se's usefulness for investigating. Spotting things that other people may miss is incredibly important for the process, and generally being one with the environment around you to not disregard factors that don't fit with your own perspective biases (that you may not realise you've applied).

PDB tends to have a pretty harsh intuitive bias so I take any detective characters typed xNxP as a grain of salt tbh, I obviously consider their arguments, but most people on the database seem to disagree that Sensors have anything to offer to society - yet simultaneously stick to a narrative that the reason Sensors aren't online is because they aren't on the internet as much which to me is a tad contradictory. However that's just my own grievances with the site lol so back to the topic at hand...

But you do also see a lot of Ne in Peralta's thinking, the brainstorming, the consideration of multiple possibilities - If I was going to type Peralta as an Ne dom it would be ENTP over ENFP, I think he relies more on logical deduction then how it relates to his moral compass, I mean him&gt;!becoming friends/frenemies with the Pontiac Bandit proves to me that he is focussed more on logic and how to utilise things then focussing more on a moral compass and how things feel.!&lt;",1617375212

ESTP sees that INTJ is alone, wanders over and starts talking to INTJ.

INTJ is now distracted from whatever he was doing, as he now finds himself having to assess this individual’s motives and behavior. 

ESTP likely had no motive.

INTJ’s head is about to implode because he has too many possible motives for ESTP. INTJ now doesn’t trust ESTP, as he can’t be sure of anything without more information. In order to acquire said information, INTJ now has to do one of his most hated activities: SOCIALIZING.

INTJ, regardless of his eventual assessment of ESTP, now hates ESTP because he unknowingly threw a wrench into whatever INTJ was doing.

“It’s not what you say, it’s how you say it.”

But I have always thought that that statement can go both ways. But many feelers don’t see how and value how something is said over what was actually said. Which is totally backwards.

I’ve seen tons of people say some truly evil things, that people let slide or didn’t even notice was evil just based off of tone.

estp,"Haha. We are all pretty nice but like many ESTPs the second I get real with a lot of people all the sudden we are mean ones. I think we have integrity and the pure guts to just talk about the elephant in the room. 

For example:
I had a friend (INTP) that wanted a girlfriend and was wondering why no one would date him. People told him all sorts of lies.

Others: You’re are great person. Someone is out there waiting for you..

Me: You’re a nice guy and all but you are very obese. No one is going to date you when you’re that obese. 

But because our culture tends to ‘love people as they are’ I’m the mean one for pointy out the real reason this guy wasn’t getting any dates. 

I also pointed out his hypocrisy about not dating even a slightly over weight women because in his words “attraction matters.”

I'm disabled so in general I've always felt like I'm not being as social/active as I want to be so lockdown didn't really knock me off as much as I thought it would.

I am realizing that Ni actually does this but in reverse, Ni users use their Ni of course in conjunction with Se, they of course always go hand in hand.

I have a friend who’s ESTP af. He played football in high school, studied marketing and entrepreneurship in college, dropped out, then started his own online business and makes hella money while traveling the world.

10 years I don’t think he really gave a fuck about anything intuitive. Now he’s all about it. He says the most important thing to being an entrepreneur is the law of attraction and a positive mindset. He uses visions boards and believes in manifestation. However, he doesn’t just sit there and go “Universe, I wish for money!” No, he sets his goals out everyday, he cultivates a positive mindset, he uses his vision board to remind himself of his goals, and he then he figures out how to make it happen. It’s truly amazing to see an ESTP that has unlocked their intuition. Fucking unstoppable",1617227357
estp,Yes. People are always surprised that I like to chill out playing city building/army building video games. But like..who doesn’t find building an entire army fun?,1617226701
estp,"I think the connection between Ti and Ni in the ESTP’s stack makes them like theoretical stuff that is somehow systematic. I think ESTP’s would enjoy strategy games, puzzle games, psychology. Anything that’s a brain teaser that makes them think “how can I solve this theoretical system and make it functional.”

Ne users might actually spend less time trying to “solve” the system. They just take the system as is, flaws and all, and start applying it to shit",1617226551

estp,"Bit of background: We've been dating for 6 months now, seeing each other for about a year. We are both in our mid 20s. I'd say he's got a rather developed Ni and Fe, and based on my results, I've got a rather balanced set of Te and Si. Guess that helps overcome some of the differences.

He helps me live more in the presence (hence meditation app) and to be more assertive with my needs. I've joined his rather extreme experiences like jumping from higher levels and going swimming in autumn/winter. next is motorcycling 😱

He likes my 'interesting questions', my 'kindness' and openness to explore physically and mentally. He says he's learning to pay more attention to subtle cues even though I think he's already been quite the perceptive person from the beginning and has a talent to make me laugh. I was surprised at how caring and loving he is as a boyfriend, despite his non-commitment attitude in the beginning.

From the start we weren't ppl to 'tie' the other down for our selfish needs. We both have a similar understanding of impermanence

I would go so far as to say that she might be worried that she herself is a narcissist, and that she is projecting that fear onto you and claiming that it's you, not her.

This is not to say that an ESTP can’t be a theoretical physicist or something of that nature, but the natural interest would need to be there, and they would need to know that learning those concepts would help them in the real-world (‘I’m learning these concepts because theoretical physics is interesting *to me*, and that’s what I want to *do* with my life; *be* a theoretical physicist.’ We are better described as “human doings” instead of human beings lol).

estp,"I'll (17F, infj) soon have to start working together on a larger long-term team with this guy (16M), who kinda seems like you're stereotypical, slightly unhealthy estp. He's not got the best reputation for being cooperative when he's annoyed, doesn't plan that well, pisses people off, overconfident and annoys a lot of the girls often. But he's definitely got good leadership, is able to act quickly and get attention, and he's got a lot of general experience of events and knowledge behind him. Not a lot of the others are even remotely keen with working with him, and see him as more of hindrance, and yet I've barely interacted with him much individually so we're on neutral terms.

I came to realise that we're polar opposites when it comes to strengths and weaknesses. I suck at being in the moment, and making choices right there and then, and my own hesitance loses me experience he already has. I can plan really throughly, easily cooperate with anyone and I'm already well-liked. During lockdown, I've gained more respect as we've moved online, whereas he's lost some.

I'm thinking of pointing these differences out to him, and suggesting that if we call out each others faults and what we should've done differently, we'd both improve. I can also point out holes in his planning before things happen, and I could ask him about things I'm not sure about. Being actually able to work with each other would gain us both respect and prevent conflict. And he seems like someone who'd value loyalty, and who does want to be respected, even if he doesn't realise how much he's damaging his own reputation.

If things become clear that I won't be able to work with him, I will call it a day. But, am I being too naïve and idealistic about all this? Is there anything I should consider beforehand? You guys probably remember more what your teen years were like, and anything that could make this all work more.",1617406262

estp,"So yes, hi guys. Firstly, I'm an entp 8w7 female and he is an estp male.(I told him to take the test btw) 

According to what my friends say, he had a crush on me last year, he was asking to my friends about me, he was defending me when I'm not around,etc. I didn't know that, he was treating me completely normal. In quarantine, I haven't heard from him a long time, we could text each other but we didn't. 

We are in the same class, I see him face to face 2-3 times a week. I guess I've started to like him. I complimented him, I touched his shoulder a few times ( I hate when someone touch me and everybody knows that in class, so that's a big thing for me) I almost held his hands and he kinda went for it, he didn't pull his hands back and looked into my eyes, we stood here for 4-5 seconds then our classmates came in and we pretended like this don't even exist. It's clear that he's special for me, someone who pays attention notices this for sure. 

But there is a problem, he's so cold and unstable. He cuts our conversation short, we get nervous when we talk especially in front of our friends. You can see it he's not acting normal. I can't understand what he want to do. If I don't talk to him he won't talk to me either.  Maybe he doesn't want to hear rumors about us, i don't want it too.

estp,"Today I’m visiting Washington from a different NE city for the first time. I’m really struck by the level of wealth and “prestige” here, and by how expensive it is. As I’m walking around, wishing I had a rain coat and some rubber wellies, I’m feeling two competing pulls towards the future of my life and career. 
On the one hand, like most ESTPs, I have a need for freedom, mobility, and excitement. I want to swashbuckle. I want to be out and about, learning new skills, trying new things, seeing new places. I get bored very easily and don’t like sitting at a desk for very long. I don’t like inefficient meetings, office politics, or paper shuffling. 
On the other is another familiar pull for ESTPs, I think. This is a desire for status and wealth. It seems like in modern America you can only really get one or the other. The frontiers are gone and wealth is accumulated through steady patience and ability to thrive in bureaucratic  environments. The wealth of DC is evidence of this. 
Is it even possible to fulfill both of these desires? Can one accumulate any kind of wealth and status in the modern west without the ability to survive overly bureaucratic, white collar professions?",1617217860
estp,"I'm going to return to uni for my final year in September where I'm studying software development.

I enjoy the practicals and problem solving that comes with software development however there are always theory lectures. 

&amp;#x200B;

Pre-Covid, we always had to go into the classroom and scan our student cards to register for the lesson. Despite software development being practical, the staff give out lectures in terms of power point and theory even though this can easily be done practically. Last uni year, as me and my friend already knew most the information, we would just chat to each other quietly in the background but there was always one class where we left as even the smallest of whispers would annoy everyone.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there a way of finding enjoyment out of theory lessons without being seen as being rude by other people, such as talking to your mates, being on your computer and programming while ignoring the teacher etc? I'll also be going into uni with new people this year so my friends could also want to pay attention instead of talk as well which would make things more annoying too.

I try to not become across as rude during lessons like this but if I just sit there, I become bored and irritated as it's either what I already know or it's theory which either means nothing or can be done practically anyway so do it on my computer instead of listening if I can.",1617195201

estp,"Congratulations! You have found yourself in possession of your own unique ESTP unit. Or rather, you have been lured into possession of said unit by the bright lights, excitable hopping/bouncing and happy-go-lucky chirping. This unit will bring you a lifetime of enjoyment w/ proper handling and care so please read thoroughly lest it runs away and causes you heartbreak.

# Getting Started

Your ESTP unit should arrive pre-activated and ready to zoom around and inspect/interact with your environment. In case your ESTP has not yet been activated, please complete the following:

1. Set the unit down in an open area with a variety of interesting objects in its field of vision.
2. Dangle a tasty treat (such as bacon) in front of it and let the scent waft into its processing unit.
3. Wait. The unit should start up and snatch the treat out of your hand. Give it a couple seconds to warm up but be ready for the sudden flurry of activity once it has received adequate sustenance.
4. \[WARNING\] If at this time the unit does not start up, please do not hypothesize about all the things that might be wrong with it. This will deplete the unit’s energy and cause it to sink further into inactivity and will require significant effort and energy to re-activate.

# Care and Maintenance

1. Do not attempt to box your unit into an enclosed area with little to no stimulation, it will break out and run away and never return.
2. Play with your unit frequently and give it free space to roam in order to strengthen it’s bond with you.
3. Do not attempt to invoke an Everlasting Bond with the unit too soon, it will freak out and run away and never return.

Note:

An Everlasting Bond can only be successfully invoked once the unit has acquired enough data on the consistency and quality of your care and handling. Free space to roam and do as it pleases is integral to the successful invocation of the Everlasting Bond, and any attempts to curtail its freedom will result in the immediate flight of the unit.

# About your ESTP unit

Your ESTP comes pre-programmed with the following traits and functions:

* Endless arsenal of fun and exciting activities to engage in.
* Irreverent sense of humor, will laugh and make fun of anything, but will attempt, for the most part, to not hurt or offend anyone seriously.
* Naturally equipped to survive and thrive in dangerous/stressful situations.
* Will get along with most other units, but will only grow close to the ones that understand and respect its freedom.
* Extremely observant and can accurately identify motivations and discrepancies in behavior and attitude in surrounding units/individuals.
* A love of freedom and extreme independence.

# Modes

**Default** 

The default setting for this unit will include a steady stream of energy, curiosity in its surroundings, and constant background analysis. The unit is generally friendly with strangers and friends alike, and will most likely be humming along, ready to engage in amusement or play.

**Adrenaline Death Monkey** 

Certain amusements can trigger this mode, when triggered, any attempts to turn it off will be fruitless, just allow it to run its course. Excited and energetic, the unit will throw itself into the usually somewhat dangerous activity at hand with little apparent regard for its own safety. While it can be concerning to watch the unit flirt with death, do not be alarmed, ESTP units come well-equipped to handle most emergency situations and will most likely emerge from its activity unharmed and exhilarated.

**Dead Food Coma Puppy**

Appearing dead but is just relaxed, the unit is most likely winding down and recharging from an intense sprint in Adrenaline Death Monkey mode, please leave ample food and water nearby and leave be. The unit should spring back into activity eventually.

**X-Ray Analysis** 

While the unit is constantly running analysis on the data it has gathered in the background, when it is in X-Ray Analysis mode, it will actively scan the individual in question to build a real-time assessment of the individual’s current State-of-Being. If this mode was triggered by an offense caused to the unit, quickly mitigate the damage done before the unit hurts you with its words. If, however, this mode was triggered by conflict involving the individual but not the unit, the unit will most likely provide a sound analysis of the situation at hand and solutions to remedy any problems present.

**Existential Depression** 

Can be triggered by sustained periods in Adrenaline Death Monkey mode, or a sustained period of lack of stimulation. If your unit appears uninterested in its surroundings and lethargic, this could be a sign of Existential Depression mode, attempt to turn off its central processing functions and once it starts up again, gently remind it of the meaningful bonds it has formed with you and other individuals/units. Good food, cleaning, and sunlight should also help.

**Fuck Off** 

Fuck off can be more accurately defined as a trigger rather than a mode, if you attempt to curtail your unit’s freedom or do not provide enough stimulation or play, the unit will Fuck Off and leave without a backwards glance to find a more suitable environment for itself. The chances for a Fuck Off will decrease with more play, stimulation and a later development phase of the unit, but the possibility for a Fuck Off will always be non-zero.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\* Please be informed that we assume no responsibility for the actions of any ESTP units; by acquiring this unit you agree that you have fully read and understood all of the above and assume all liability for any damages the unit may cause or any losses you may incur. Thank you.

It doesn't go well...
He just kind of mirrors his twins interests. So I don't know what he actually likes.

estp,"Dear ESTP,

I didn't notice you at first until you started talking to me. I didn't know that in the small amount of time you hung back in the background, you were taking everything in-- including me.

You were relaxed, easy-going, funny, and playful. I talked to my coworkers about you (gushing and failing to hide it), and within a week of joining the company, everyone I'd spoken to had only great things to say about you. Somehow, you could filled the entire room. You were never loud or in the spotlight. You were just there and the presence of someone so in control was enchanting.
 
You set people at ease. You read people well. You ooze charisma. I can't quite put my finger on why literally everyone had the impression that you were cool, reasonable, in control-- smooth. 

And that's when it happens. I started to learn that you'd drive to work on rainy days and offer to take me back to the station, so I started praying for rainy days. In the little time we had in the car, you pointed out 5 different houses that your friends lived in, told me about the Smoke Pit joint on the corner with the best barbeque, and navigated the streets while composing a long text and making perfect conversation with me. 
Of course, I was awe-struck. And who could blame me? I'm sorry for exaggeration, as ""ENFP""s tend to put flourish on judgments. But believe me when I say that I've never met anyone like you. It is like witnessing a god(!) in his natural element. Every moment in your presence was so exciting, intoxicating, fun, irresistibly explosive with quips, noises, bits of song, and random entrepreuneurial ideas you managed to cram all in one car ride. I was hooked. I still am. 

You are brilliant and perceptive and you are a beast of motion. Of accomplishment. Though you rarely divulge and sappy, mushy feelings to me, the way you set aside time for me in your busy life helped me understand that actions really do speak louder than words. I'll never forget one of the nicest things you've said to me: ""You're like my partner in crime"".  
I know you don't like to commit. I know you only take things day by day. I know emotions are just emotions to you. Nothing to be mulled over and turned round and round in your head to be dissected and identified. It's just another element of the landscape to be manipulated or manouevered around. To DO means there's little time to overthink, to ruminate. And sometimes it doesn't even seem like you think much. But that's only because the speed at which you come to conclusions is the fastest. Ever, probably.

I love that you've done everything under the sun and still look for new ways to play this game we call life. It's so inspirational to see you put everything into motion so deftly. I love how fast you pick up on melodies and regurgitate a song with eerie accuracy and replace it with some stupid fucking words and I laugh and laugh and laugh. I love how you point out funny street signs or spy an alleycat or notice a bouquet of flowers someone is carrying as we whip by at 50 miles per hour. You make me feel so oblivious sometimes.

You've changed my life. I break my heart loving you so hard because you are SO MUCH to love. I hope I never stop laughing and learning and living with you. I've never felt that life was much of a fantastic adventure until you came along. So thank you for giving me endless optimism and encouragement and setting an example of what a well-lived life looks like.

I love you so much. No, you don't have to say it back. We'll hang out soon, and nothing is more precious than your time. I will try to keep up.

Love,
Your ENFP",1615863882

-seems bossy and controlling, likes to be in control of external environment
-talks more about what people are doing, like a big house someone has, but seems day dreamy other times (ni ?-)
- not very conversational, more a get to the point type, doesn't like small talk or long conversations
- duty seems important seems to like to help people but seems scattered and likes to have plans then changes them
-seems very unsettling at times. Needs lots of attention, always has to be about them. But then seems very private also. Often goes off for alone time.
- seems emotional underneath, is very much about family but keeps everyone else at arms length even family sometimes
-will come up with ideas, like how to move furniture around and what it will look like and could do this and do that
-doesn't seem that logical, it seems that way at first but not really

-they are doers
-communication seems short and sharp
-sometimes seems their way or no way but not sure if this is a stress response
-zones in and out of conversations

-when complaining it's often about how something or other doesn't work, but she's so stuck in present moment and gets very frustrated at whatever the thing is that's not working
-is quite precise with things, like cooking. 
- very emotionally reactive all the time - this is the one that has me the most stuck with her, are ISTP even emotionally reactive? She becomes like panicky and scattered.

Also,  is this enneagram 5? I keep thinking she's type 8 or type 7 but maybe I'm seeing type 5 ? Any hints on that would be great too :)

estp,"Hey there! I don't usually ask questions but this time I had to.

There's this ESTP that gives me anxiety in everything that she does, I don't know why but I come out as controlling and obsessive. 

My biggest fear is if I moved out of this relationship, she'll probably ruin her life. We had an intense relationship for 6 months and then we broke up and now we are trying to get back together, it'll be 2 year in may. While we were apart, she started with some businesses with her college friends. And this again bothers me, now that we we back together, I am taking care of her expenses which isn't much to be honest. 


We know each other since childhood. I was her childhood crush. 

I always think intuitive girl is all I need but then I love her and I have to deal with it no matter what. 

She loves me more than I do in many cases. I don't like talking everyday but she wants to everyday. Is this even how estp does things? 

She is friendly and has quite a few male friends, which for me is an issue as I don't put any effort into making friends, let alone female friends.

I like a girl who does art/writing/music and indulges in creative things rather than a people person.

One thing I know for sure is, she loves me. No matter what she does the entire day, at the end of the day, she'll always start looking for me.

I want some insights from the female estps here.

Specific questions:

1. Can an estp go extra mile and compromise on things that she usually does for love?

2. Can they be loyal, I mean she has quite a few male friends and she's hot.

3. But man, why do they lie? Like stupid lies, they don't even work. Like in a sentence they just lie out of no where and when I get into the detail of the whole thing, it's easy to tell they'r lying. 

4. Will it work ENTP and ESTP?

5. It was me who walked out of the relationship and it's me who's back. And she's changed a bit this time around. Some insights on this aswell",1615422698

estp,"Hello, everyone I recently have been studying about sensory processing sensitivity (SPS) which is an attribute of highly sensitive persons (HSPs). I am curious to see if certain MBTI types are more likely to be HSPs than others, so I am going to post a poll in each subreddit about this. **You can find out if you are an HSP by taking the following test:** [**Are You Highly Sensitive? – The Highly Sensitive Person (hsperson.com)**](https://hsperson.com/test/highly-sensitive-test/)**. A score higher than 14 on this test indicates that you might have SPS (you are an HSP).** If you do not like the binary nature of this test you can take the version used by researchers here: [Microsoft Word - HSPSCALE\_2007\_research.doc (hsperson.com)](http://hsperson.com/pdf/HSPSCALE_2007_research.pdf). A score of 105 or higher on this version indicates that you likely are an HSP (I calculated this cutoff by using the cutoff for the shorter version which is 15/27 possible points and assuming that the same percentage of points on the longer test indicates that you are an HSP). **If you are willing please take the test to see if you are an HSP and then fill out the poll below. Thank you.**

I am also going to post some research articles here for those of you who would like to learn more about HSPs and the research behind it (I am quoting from another post that I made about this):

""Hello everybody, I have recently been looking at various studies regarding HPSs. To be honest when I first heard about HSPs I thought that the idea was either a false pop psychology idea, or autism spectrum disorder or anxiety disguised under a fancy name. However, after reading the studies I will list below I am now convinced that sensory processing sensitivity (SPS) is real and that being an HSP is a unique, valid concept. I believe these studies are useful to get an in-depth understanding of what it truly means to be an HSP and they can also be useful to show that the idea of HSPs is valid. Here are the studies:

[The functional highly sensitive brain: a review of the brain circuits underlying sensory processing sensitivity and seemingly related disorders (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5832686/) (Discusses fMRI studies of SPS in comparison to autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, and post-traumatic stress disorder. This review shows that SPS is its own separate, unique trait and is different from the previously mentioned disorders)

[The highly sensitive brain: an fMRI study of sensory processing sensitivity and response to others' emotions - PubMed (nih.gov)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25161824/) (Provides evidence that higher HSP scores are correlated with “stronger activation of brain regions involved in awareness, empathy, and self-other processing”)

[The trait of sensory processing sensitivity and neural responses to changes in visual scenes (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3023077/) (“SPS was associated with significantly greater activation in brain areas involved in high-order visual processing (i.e. right claustrum, left occipitotemporal, bilateral temporal and medial and posterior parietal regions) as well as in the right cerebellum, when detecting minor (*vs* major) changes in stimuli.”)

[Sensory Processing Sensitivity Predicts Individual Differences in Resting-State Functional Connectivity Associated with Depth of Processing - PubMed (nih.gov)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33561863/) (“The present study showed that SPS is associated with \[resting-state\] brain connectivity implicated in attentional control, consolidation of memory, physiological homeostasis, and deliberative cognition. These results support theories proposing ""depth of processing"" as a central feature of SPS and highlight the neural processes underlying this cardinal feature of the trait.”)

[Higher sensory processing sensitivity, introversion and ectomorphism: New biomarkers for human creativity in developing rural areas (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3409988/) (Discusses various aspects of SPS such as its involvement in creativity and also its presence in animals)

[Temperament trait of sensory processing sensitivity moderates cultural differences in neural response (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2894664/) (“Here, 10 European-Americans and 10 East Asians underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing simple visuospatial tasks emphasizing judgments that were either context independent (typically easier for Americans) or context dependent (typically easier for Asians). As reported elsewhere, each group exhibited greater activation for the culturally non-preferred task in frontal and parietal regions associated with greater effort in attention and working memory. However, further analyses, reported here for the first time, provided preliminary support for moderation by SPS. Consistent with the careful-processing theory, high-SPS individuals showed little cultural difference; low-SPS, strong culture differences.”)

[A psychometric evaluation of the Highly Sensitive Person Scale: The components of sensory-processing sensitivity and their relation to the BIS/BAS and “Big Five” - ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886905003909) (“Results demonstrate that the HSPS is a valid and reliable measure of the construct of SPS. However, in contrast to Aron and Aron’s finding that the scale is unidimensional, the current results support a three-component structure consisting of Aesthetic Sensitivity (AES), Low Sensory Threshold (LST), and Ease of Excitation (EOE).” “AES showed the strongest relation with Openness to Experience, while LST and EOE were found to be most closely associated with Neuroticism.” Unfortunately, this study is not free access, but if you are a student or faculty at a school you might be able to get access to the full text through your institution.)

[The relationships between sensory processing sensitivity, alexithymia, autism, depression, and anxiety - ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886908001281) (“The goal of the current investigation was to better understand the relationships between the three recently-developed factors of sensory processing sensitivity (ease of excitation – EOE, low sensory threshold – LST, and aesthetic sensitivity – AES) and alexithymia, autism symptoms, anxiety, and depression. Two hundred and one college students completed the highly sensitive person scale, as well as measures of anxiety, depression, alexithymia, and autism symptoms. EOE and LST were related to autism symptoms, alexithymia, anxiety, and depression. AES was related to attention to details (a symptom of autism) and anxiety but not to depression. It was also negatively related to externally-oriented thinking (a symptom of alexithymia). Results indicate that AES is conceptually distinct from LST and EOE. Furthermore, EOE interacted with difficulty identifying feelings in predicting anxiety, indicating that being both easily excited by stimuli and unable to identify one’s feelings is particularly anxiety provoking.”)

[A psychometric evaluation of the Highly Sensitive Person Scale in ethnically and culturally heterogeneous South African samples | SpringerLink](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12144-020-00988-7) (The HSPS scale was tested for cross-cultural reliability via administration of the test to a group of students from a South African university. The HSPS scale was found to be reliable in this study and “Factor analysis revealed a novel five-factor solution (Negative Affect, Neural Sensitivity, Propensity to Overwhelm, Careful Processing and Aesthetic Sensitivity). As per previous reports, latent class analysis suggested a three class solution.” The study also discusses some weaknesses of the HSPS scale that could be improved such as the lack of reverse-coding in the assessment to address agreeability bias (i.e. reversing statements to make them negative). For example, I avoid violent movies could be easily reverse coded by switching the wording to I enjoy violent movies, but the original scale does not do this for any of the questions.)

[Dandelions, tulips and orchids: evidence for the existence of low-sensitive, medium-sensitive and high-sensitive individuals - PubMed (nih.gov)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29353876/) (“While we were able to identify a highly sensitive (orchids, 31%) and a low-sensitive group (dandelions, 29%), we also detected a third group (40%) characterised by medium sensitivity, which we refer to as tulips in keeping with the flower metaphor.” “the three groups differed in neuroticism, extraversion and emotional reactivity to positive mood induction with orchids scoring significantly higher in neuroticism and emotional reactivity and lower in extraversion than the other two groups (dandelions also differed significantly from tulips).” “**Findings suggest that environmental sensitivity is a continuous and normally distributed trait** but that people fall into three distinct sensitive groups along a sensitivity continuum.”)

[Sensory Processing Sensitivity and its association with personality traits and affect: A meta-analysis - ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0092656619300583) (“SPS in children correlated with Neuroticism (*r =* 0.42) but did not with Extraversion, Openness, Agreeableness or Conscientiousness. In adults, SPS correlated with Openness (*r =* 0.14) and Neuroticism (*r =* 0.40) but did not with Extraversion, Agreeableness or Conscientiousness.” Again, like the previous study the full text of this study is sadly unavailable for free.)

[The Role of Attachment Insecurity and Big Five Traits on Sensory Processing Sensitivity - PubMed (nih.gov)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30321115/) (“Attachment avoidance, but not attachment anxiety, moderated the effect of BIS activity on SPS indicating that, compared to those with high BIS sensitivity, those with low levels of both BIS and attachment avoidance reported lower level of SPS. Attachment anxiety, neuroticism, extraversion, and openness partially mediated the effects of BIS on SPS.” You can read more about attachment theory here: [Attachment theory - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_theory).)

[Sensory Processing Sensitivity in the context of Environmental Sensitivity: A critical review and development of research agenda - ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763418306250) (“We conclude that SPS increases risk for stress-related problems in response to negative environments, but also provides greater benefit from positive and supportive experiences.”)

[The moderating role of sensory processing sensitivity in the link between stress and depression: A VBM study - PubMed (nih.gov)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33276034/) (“Behavioral results showed that, compared with individuals low in EOE (i.e., ease of excitation, a sub-dimension of SPS), those high in EOE were more likely to report depressive symptoms under stress.” SPS can predispose people to depression under stressful conditions.)

I made this exact post for some typing communities but I thought it would be nice to post it here as well to see what your thoughts, as estps are. I'm currently torn between the ISTP and ESTP although in the past, I thought I was an isfp for a long time and then an entp. 

(The traits' list is random not from most to least important or sth similar) 

• I'm a 14yo girl and an only child

• I have this positive vibe and I try to deal with bad things that happen by joking and not getting too serious
. 
• I am generally an optimistic person as mentioned above but my decisions and the way I judge things are realistic.
 
• I am courageous and brave and I really like to be the first one that tries sth difficult or sth considered dangerous. I feel so proud after that. 

• I am opinionated and I'm not scared to voice these opinions. 

• Whenever a friend of mine has a problem and they come to me, I usually try to comfort them by offering them solutions and making them see the issue from a more positive perspective. 

• Emotional displays make me uncomfortable

• I tend to be tense in environments where I try sth new that requires people who know things about the subject I'm trying having their attention on me. For example, I used to take vocal lessons (I stopped a month ago) and I was in a band with other kids. You cannot imagine the stress I was feeling every time I was there. But in contrast, in my guitar lessons (which I also stopped) when I was at a concert and the audience was looking at me, I didn't feel nervous. Ig it's because not all of them had knowledge on the subject or sth? 

• I'm also reserved around people I don't know well but when I start opening up or when I'm around my friends, I'm very talkative and quite loud. 

• I hate feeling ordinary, ignorant and the same as everybody else (but I've heard that's a teen issue so idk) 

• I had a short temper and an attitude since I was little. 

• I'm always up to try new things. 

• I'm ambitious 

• I respect a lot people who are fair and honest no matter what

• I can make tough calls

• I like studying in depth and get as much knowledge as possible about a subject I'm interested in

• I have a good imagination

• I am caring and I like to give to people but when I don't receive even sth small in return I start getting bitter. 

• I'm selfless yet selfish. 

• I'm down to earth and I understand where my abilities stop or begin, self-aware. 

• During my childhood, I've taken up many hobbies and then gave up on them. I took drawing, ballet (ew), volleyball, vocal and guitar lessons only to drop them later on although I have to admit I was taking guitar lessons for 4-5 years (before going to an auditorium this year and then I decided to stop, ughh I hope you understand the story, I explain it better below) and traditional dance lessons for 9-10. The dance genre choice has nothing to do with a desire to preserve the past, it was simply the only dance lesson around and all my friends would go. It taught me tho how to have a sense of unison because we were so many people that we attended festivals and organized celebrations altogether so it will always have a place in my heart haha. 

• This year is the only year I don't have an activity. Well I had the vocal and guitar lessons until last month as I said but now I only have my Spanish lessons. At first, I didn't like that I didn't have sth to do outside the lessons. I was so used in doing sth so I felt weird and unproductive which I hate. But after some time I realized that it's okay and that I've tried many things and it doesn't matter if not all of them worked out. Now I'm writing a book and I hope it turns out long enough and not run out of ideas lmao. 

• Also, I forgot. The reason I quit the vocal and guitar lessons in the auditorium was because it was so based on theory yk and it just got tiring. I didn't like this formal approach. 

• My interests vary and I'm down to anything. Deep conversations, a football game, vibing to songs, pulling pranks, whatever it is I like to try. 

• My current hobbies include writing, reading, searching up stuff I'm interested in, listening to a lot of music and hanging out with my friends. 

• I usually get stressed out easily but I'm able to think calmly and smartly under stressful situations. 

• I'm kind and polite until you push my buttons. If that happens, I can roast you just by being honest about you lmao. 

• When I'm angry, I've got told I get blunt and rude. 

• I am skeptical about authorities or different ideologies (eg religion) but that doesn't mean I act like a bitch around them. I don't feel the need to do it tbh.

I know it's not the most stereotypical ESTP thing, but I've always been into literature and writing (which is also why I thought I was intuitive for a long while). But I think of writing as a craft, not an art; when writing, I strive for clarity rather than creativity, and I adhere to a realist style.  I'm not as good at complicated language as I am at conveying a clear image to the reader (Se-Ti). My preferred reading material (Hemingway, Orwell, Ellison, Murakami) reflects this.

Yes, but also no.

Yes, cause I think he's super charming and he makes me giggle everytime I look at him, also we have really great pyjama parties.

But no, because he needs to have the upper hand to feel in control, and will push my buttons every time he feels uncomfortable and insecure - which makes me insecure, which again makes him feel more secure.


I asked why he does this, and he says he's just joking... and I know that he genuinely believes it's just harmless fuckery. 
But I don't want to play the social game to win. I'd rather play for fun, but it seems like he doesn't know how to play with me, and instead play against me.

Today I got so sick of him doing this that I mirrored him, did some psychological stuff back at him, and he shut down and looked pretty hurt.
I feel so bad for doing this, and I question if it's good for any of us to keep having a connection.

estp,"**Saeko's inner monologue: (ESTP)**

I think I've got a bad habit. I'm too quick to give people the old once-over.

Too quick to ask if they're my type...

...to see if I can maybe date them.

I guess I got sex on the brain. That's no good. I can't just categorize people like that.

All right, that's it! I'm gonna use college as a chance to build new human relationships!

I'll make friends with no ulterior motives and then I'll find a pure, true love--

Actually, I take that back! I really wanna bang this chick!!

**Miwa's inner monologue later: (INFJ)**

Something I've discovered now that I'm dating is the huge difference between fantasy and reality. I was under the impression that being someone's lover was totally different than being their friend.

In movies and television, it always seems like such a mature relationship. Being with Saeko is nothing like that but weirdly it doesn't really bothger me.

It's different than I had imagined it, true...

...but there are so many things that I now realize I couldn't have possibly imagined...

It's incredibly fun and also kind of a wonderful thing, I think.

(Saeko commenting while she and Miwa are watching penguins mate) ""Oh my God...Awesome! It's a live sex show!!""

I do wish sometimes that it was a **little** more like I'd imagined.

**Miwa and Saeko after Saeko tried to drag her to a love hotel:**

(Miwa) ""I mean, isn't it a little soon? It's only been a month. I'm just not ready for this. It's too quick. C-Could you wait until three months...?""

(Saeko) ""Three months...?! What kind of benchmark is that?!""

**Miwa and Saeko when they finally have sex:**

(Miwa) ""How about that! You're a person, just like me!""

(Saeko) ""Of course I am! What did you think I was? A monster?""

(Miwa) ""Something like that, maybe.""

(Saeko) ""Whaaaat? C'mon...""

**Misc dialogue between Saeko and Miwa, alternating starting with Saeko:**

""And how come we've gotta have roommates? We can't do anything sexy!""

""Keep your voice down...""

""Sex, sex, boning...""

""Stop!""

""I know we can't do it in the hotel room! But can we do it here?""

""No possible way.""

I personally don't like being with too many partners at once, I'm usually aiming for the best I can get at the moment and then loosing interest in others. For me to leave there has to come around a way more attractive one in order to leave, no matter if I'm in love or not.

I don't think that's a female/male thing in ESTPs as one of my female ESTP friends really fucks a ton of guys and also multiple ones at the same time. She's the most extreme example of the playboy/bunny ESTPs I know. 
On the other hand I know an ESTP who is also pretty attractive but he's staying with one partner pretty much the whole time.

* Can't sit still, always needs something to do. Procrastinator, but not extremely so.
* A bit worse at school than my friends, but better at getting work/internships.
* Still very academically smart (this is why I think I could be an intuitive, because the stereotypical ESTP sounds like such a dumbass lol)
* 3-6 side projects at a time. Always looking for new shit to do.
* Humor style consists of put-downs, dirty jokes, and situational irony
* Good communicator and negotiator. Excellent writer. Direct, but also humorous and ingratiating.
* Not a gym addict, but enjoy light running and (sometimes) football/basketball
* Mean streak; was unpopular earlier because of rudeness. Have toned it down since, and gained more friends as a result.
* Used to be into philosophy; now I perceive such things as useless. Most of my reading material now consists of practical or instructional books.
* I don't argue with people in the classic ""factual"" ENTP way; if I think someone's argument is dumb, I'll most likely call it dumb first. I'll only engage with it if I respect the *person*.
* I tell a lot of white lies and half-truths to keep people happy or get what I want.
* If I dislike someone, I'll never say it to their face. I'll more likely tell everyone else behind their back. I never ""show my whole hand"" when talking to someone.
* Excellent long-term planner (not a typical ExTP trait, I know). ""Go with the flow"" in the short term.
* Elitist, but only internally. I'll never express my elitism outwardly except to my friends. In fact, I dislike people who are overtly elitist.
* Attracted to name brands and prestige. ""Shallow"" in that sense.
* Enneagram 3. I think 3w2, but not sure. Socionics LIE.

estp,"I am an ESTP male. Of all the male types, I find it hardest to interact with ESFJ males.

I often have this pattern of interaction with ESFJ males. I believe it is more applicable to a subset of them, those who see themselves as leaders.

The pattern typically goes like this - The guy will try to be my friend, and being a someone with the everything goes attitude, I initially roll along with it.

Eventually the guy tries to enforce his leadership in thought and action, and when I resist instead of backing off, they persist even more (super clingy with a big smile).

It is like they do not take subtle hint at all. Once they have become convinced that they must enforce their leadership onto others, and I must belong to that gang, nothing short of very direct humiliation changes their conviction. Sometimes they persist even after that, with a passive aggressive attitude of being friendly on the surface, but passing demeaning remarks in a slightly indirect way.

estp,"Hey guys, I'm an INFP and I'm wondering if you could help me. I'm really worried about my ESTP friend. A lot of bad stuff has happened to him recently and I think he's spiralling. At the very least, he's definitely not doing very well.

He's been engaging in a lot of self-destructive behaviour--drinking, doing stupid shit like trying to see how many green lights he can speed through in a row while driving at night, working out way too much, barely eating because apparently he's just never hungry, etc.

And yeah, he does this shit when he's upset, but he's been through a lot in a short amount of time, and I've never seen him act this way before. It's like he's constantly in this drunken haze and he refuses to listen to or think about anything. He'll sleep for hours and then do crazy shit when he's awake, just fall back asleep and repeat the cycle. Sometimes he's just a shell of who he used to be, and it scares the hell out of me.

When he's upset I usually just wait for him to process his own emotions and come to me when he's ready to talk, but this time he's just refusing to deal with what's bothering him and instead choosing to avoid it by doing literally anything else. The other day I breached an unspoken rule in our friendship and told him that he needed to talk to someone--it didn't have to be me--to get his emotions out and deal with them in a constructive manner. I said that I couldn't just sit back and watch him destroy himself and that he needed to get help. He didn't take it very well at all. He got angry, we ended up getting into a screaming match and we haven't spoken since. I feel really guilty about the way I handled it.

God, I'm so worried about him that I'm asking a subreddit full of strangers for advice. I just have no idea how to get through to him. I want to help and make sure that he's ok, but whatever I do just seems to make things worse. He's lived his entire life taking care of and protecting others, but he's never really learned how to take care of himself, and that just makes this entire situation so much worse; he supports me unconditionally whenever my mental health takes a turn for the worst, but I, on the other hand, can barely help him at all.

estp,"When i do the test when pissed i get Entj, when i do the test when im all loving and please someone love me attittude i get estp or something else. i got entp years ago.

**Background:**

I grew up with a weird unproductive entj yelly abusive father, i was some entp with slight autism, got made fun of alot. was never productive..   when i turned 20 i started getting into fights with my father and changed alot since them, ever since i showed my father that i can beat him up .especially since i want to get out of his household. i made plans and all sorts of shit, and actually have a todo list for my life and organize stuff, i never did these in the past because of cptsd, adhd and depression.

**Productivity:**

I like to think im productive, but because of my depression and cptsd, i cant focus much or think much, i have super organized todolists for each day and planned some stuff over the 1 to 5 year period, i have a basic direction of how i want to live even though the depression sometimes makes me unconfident about it.

**Social life:**

I did have a bit of social anxiety (because growing up with an abusive father causes stuff like his), however ive read alot of books on assertiveness, dating and basicly socializing and manipulation, i programmed some reactive social skills into me that are pretty fucking cool. when im not narcissistically monologuing to girls, i can say some pretty interesting and sexy shit... i can reply to guys in the most fun non pissed way even when they try to fuck with me,  people started to dig me after this and alot of girls hit on me, guys hit on me wanting to beat them up during sex,  some INFP or Iswhatever girls also talk to me but i dont reply as they expect me to be some super MANLY guy, which i dont care about pretending to me...     

in short , i dont talk to people much, and talk to people alot at the same time , i keep meeting new people and dismiss people i know, i love the act of meeting new girls, and networking, but i hate talking to the same person. and i get bored easily ( never had a relationship but only one night stands with some ENFP sort of girls, i expect the girl to be fun and crazy, fuck introverts)

and im a bit reckless , i can take my shirt off and skateboard, meet random people ( im like an introverted extrovert or something , i think alot on the inside but i also can say alot .

**Carreer and passions**

Currently almost finished studying architecture. and about to go into either construction or business side of things, art wont get you any money hehe..    i love skateboarding, playing video games, reading psychology books ( and manipulation books heh), i can do serious shit , i can draw good, make music, ive made video games, and edited alot of videos since age 12, i made some 3D archviz animation at one point ,and even got one video on youtube to 2Million views at age 14.... most of my friends think im some mega productive fuck,  im just adhd and go one step at a time .. keep on pushing..

**Day to day:**

i like my day to be productive and chill at the same time ( mainly cause i cant be SUPERmega ass produtive due to adhd) ,, so it would involve reading some practical book for 25 minutes , doing basic stuff, break, doing uni work, playing a video game for 25 minutes, break... etc. 

i like reading non fiction practical books, as i find that life is too short to waste time on fiction and RPG games, but i like to think that maybe when im rich and have my life in order id play them

**Ambitions and future:**  
Maybe think about the future alot cause my present is a bit, eh... in lebanon , no money and with an abusive dad... i have to get out you know..  so i want to get out and work, make money.. i would also want to find time to skateboard ( my hobby).

&amp;#x200B;

i want to reach a point where i have so much money, power, so i can enjoy it with people that are too cool for normal society, i want to be respected. and feel powerful.. i want to be able to shut people up by just my presence alone...   however.. while that may scream entj... i dont feel like i want to boss people around, i just want to chill with a girl.. and live my life having fun,  but to get to that point i need money, and since entjs get the most money, i have to fake that entj personality even if its not my type.. so i believe im a bit nice, but since society pissed me off, im a bit introverted with my thoughts and reserved on what i believe, but if i meet the right people i can open up just fine and act like an attention whore .. ( im kinda hot and work out btw).

&amp;#x200B;

SO what do you think.. i used to identify with being an entp, i got estp but then i found out estps are too much of pussies to do what they want, i actually have a fucking personality and i dont care if people get pissed but i what i have to do, fuck them.. fitting in is for people that lack balls. however entps arent my shit, but entjs are too serious? i can yell just fine but i dont like yelling at people

estp,"I think of you guys as a hot pan. Of course you can get burned, but if used correctly they can be game changing. ESTPs are total button pushers. They like playing with people, and if you understand that you've overcome the biggest difficulties you'll have with them. As an INFP you just gotta give it back, and laugh about it.

There's an honesty to all ESTPs. They don't really care what you think, and that's useful. I've never played games with an ESTP, they'll just call it how they see it. That's way fucking better than having a guessing game with the expectations of a high Ni user or playing minesweeper with the emotions of an high Fe user. There's no bullshit, and if you piss them off they'll tell you.

Earning the respect of an ESTP is awesome, because you can just be chill and have fun. I don't have to feel the need to censor myself, you all just say what's on your mind and let me speak my truth. I think ESTPs can be kinda rough, but sensitive people are tedious in comparison.

I've noticed that I have stable patterns with the ESTPs in my life. You keep things real, and just like to have a good time. The inevitable conflict is good for everyone, keeping us sharp, but the drama I've noticed with other types is just toxic for everyone.

Just wanted to say that you guys are great. You're a lot more honorable than some of the other people that I've meet.",1613064811
estp," 

(im a guy btw, 22 year old)

i did the tests shitloads of times, i got entp, entj and estj occassionally, but im sure im either entp or entj.thing is , i grew up with an entj dad and that fucked me up bad, he sucked at alot of things, and was just an asshole and made fun of me so he looks smart and good..so ive had CPTSD and adhd, was made fun of in school. i geniunely hate most people except some fun innocent people. i help these. the rest, FUCK EM..

why did i type about my background? cause i thought i was an entp cause i use to joke around alot and dream , masturbate and not do shit...but then after beating my dad up and standing up for myself, i became the entj... i became super bossy and assertive .and im not sure if im entj , entp or whatever. next sections will describe me so you can best define.

**Emotions and care:**

* I used to care about others and wanting to help them, nowadays i dont give a flying fuck about anyone but my sister and me, i do however try to help some of my dumb fuck friends wasting their potential cause it would suck if they continued wasting their life.
* i generally put myself first, and say no to shit i dont want to do, basiclly i love myself first

**Planning:**

* i used to really be bad at being productive because of adhd , but i was efficient that i got things done really well but before the deadline, i have never failed anything.
* after beating my dad up and changing, i have a todo list for each day, that way its flexible and even if i got up late i can still go at it. i have plans for the future but im not sure if my adhd will help much in terms of working as a pawn in an office so im keeping things open for now.

**Career:**

* I studied architecture because i thought thats where the money is at ( turns out im dead wrong)
* i believe a job where i manage things and come up with solutions would fit me ( basicly entp entj jobs) any job where im valued and i have power, but also a fun job. i generally like having power of employees. currently studying programming before i finish my masters in architecture in case i want to switch when architecture dies as a profession.

**social Dating:**

* i was a weird extrovert social wise, i like to externalize my thoughts but i do spend time alot and enjoy my time alot more.
* Im the type of guy that can get any girl, without bragging much , but im the only guy in my class that is fucking the most, (simply because i dont care about girls much so they come to me) again, not bragging but this is how it is, im surprised too
* ive read alot of books on social tricks and stuff like that , it helped me tremendously with my social life, super practical. i know talk to people in the most interesting way possible, they dig it , i occasionally make them feel like shit on purpose so they think twice about feeling like i love them. ( makes shit interesting)
* and i generally love people, but i have no problem being a dick. girls that are entp and fun generally click with me and i Love how fun and horny they are, girls that are something else call me an asshole and a dick, i dont reply to them and they want to fuck me for some reason.
* I LOOVE those fun open minded chicks that i can get to talk to easily and have open minded sex with. (entps i guess? ) but i also feel like i could be an entp and let an entj girl run the show, i dont mind. as long as someone is doing the work and giving me money. so i just want that part of life taken care of so i can have fun

So im not sure what type of person i am MBTI wise, i used to think im an ENTP cause im generally chill and think im full of love, but i realized that other people find me cold and an asshole. im kinda not. but i do believe someone has to be an asshole to get to the top and make money.. then you can enjoy life..

i just want to make shitloads of money and have fun, living a good life

I generally like having fun, but i want to make sure im making money and have my life in check first, i havent read that entjs like to have fun, i feel like theyre more serious, which is why im lost.

estp,"I (26f, ENFP) met a guy (22m) online who i assume is an ESTP.

We started talking, and sexting everyday. I didnt much think of him at that time because I dunno, i dont feel a really strong connection. Fastforward to the second month of talkin and sexting, i found him generally pleasant and very eager to please.

He would always text me even though im sleeping (we have different timezones) and when im awake we would talk for a bit and then he would go to sleep. Because of his ""dedication"" to me, like always saying things like ""im going to sleep now. ill message u when i wake up"" ""im so busy as it is with work and youre the only one i make time for"" ""babe, i almost want to say i love you"" ""im happy i met you"" :im happy you came into my life""  and sending me snaps all throughout the day, talking about mundane stuff and his personal life etc, i thought, wow this guy seems like a really sincere one, and he really makes it a point to message me all the time, like the only time we dont talk is when we r both sleeping respectively. 

My previous boyfriend (24M ENTJ) before him was totally the opposite, and the reason for our breakup was because my previous bf wasnt communicative. and it bummed me the hell out. All i ever wanted was maybe a simple good morning or something but he wouldnt do that. ive raised that issue with him many times but he never listened AND would always blame the timezone difference, so i thought it best to break up with him. then here comes ENTP guy, who is all the things that i want my ex to be. So I thought, fine what the heck let me give this guy a chance, so I did.

The relationship with ENTP guy was really fun, we never had any dull moment, hes really giving with the sext and we also talk about nonsensical things which is great. He also started opening up to me about how he grew up, his blended family, how he hated his mom when he was younger, how sad he was a child etc.

&amp;#x200B;

and then one day, he told me he was gonna meet up with a childhood bestfriend of his, so I said ok have fun. I didnt bother him at all during that time because I know for a fact that when he is out with his friends, he doesnt use his phone much.... and then after three days, he still hasnt texted... which is so unlike him, so i asked him whats wrong and he left me on seen.

When I saw that he left me on seen, I told him that its all right and I get the message.He immediately replied and told me he was busy with work and all but that he wants to talk to me.. and then, i left that on seen...

and then BAM, HE TOLD ME HE SLEPT WITH SOMEONE...

So obviously we dont talk anymore. He told me he likes me but he cant do the distance.

Honestly, if he cant do the distance, he shouldnt have led me on at all. And it made me feel horrible to know that im just his temporary fix... It just really blows my mind how he professed his care for me days before and then proceeds to bang another woman he just met.

i know he just met the girl because he told me that ""it was unexpected, it was a complete out of nowhere thing"".. like hell it is. the thing is, his sorry wasnt even that sincere. Didnt even sound remorseful at all.  its like, ""so hey i found someone, goodbye! peace!""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

estp," This person has been quietly upset/hurt w the boys they are running a club and org w bc the boys told them that they can't \*technically\* say that they founded the org w them due to having not started the social media acc/planned the 1st protest w them (this makes the person feel discredited, as they did do a lot of work for the org) and due to one of the boys telling them that they go on tangents during prep meetings and the meetings last ""2 hours."" They have been venting to friends but not said anything directly to the boys

They remember what one of the boys said abt them going on tangents, and decide when they have their prep meeting again that they'll be muted/quiet unless spoken to or asked for their input. However, they notice that now that they are muted, both boys are unmuted and talk to each other abt which song to choose/their classes/general stuff (the boys essentially j talk to each other now that the girl is muted.)

She does sit through it but feels angry, that the boys j wanted to chat w each other, that they are making the org+club involvement exclusive to themselves even though she did a lot of work, unwanted... by the time that 15 minutes have passed she is very upset, though she still does not say anything, and even though she understands that they need to prep for the meeting, she feels strongly unwanted and that they j want to be by themselves... and so, although she wouldn't normally, she leaves the meeting abruptly, almost impulsively, without notice 15 minutes in, as they are j talking to each other while she has been on mute for most of the time.

She feels weird abt it and knows that it will cause a rift but cries to herself, vents to friends some more, and doesn't re-join the meeting. She admits to one of the boys when he messages her that she felt unwanted/disliked, and is generally a lot more quiet in meetings w them moving forward (tho she is touched by the boy apologizing/clearing things up)

estp,"I’m 100% sure I’m a xxTP. I’m assuming ExTP because I definitely have too much Fe for it to be inferior. And before that I always used to think I was an xSTP just because I felt like I had Se and it seemed pretty obvious. Through process of elimination I went with ESTP and it pretty much works so I’ve been going with it.

The only reason I’m confused is because I daydream way too much. I wouldn’t say I live inside my head but I definitely get stuck in there sometimes. I’ll just get caught up in the idea of doing something rather than actually doing it. I always see people compare Ne as being satisfied with the idea of it while Se likes to see the idea come to fruition. Thing is I don’t think I have that rapid fire brainstorming capability that Ne doms seem to have. That picture never seemed to fit me even though people have said I can act like that sometimes. 

So basically, I’m lost. Is this just well developed Ti or am I missing something? Any other ESTPs who’ve dealt with this or have any thoughts to share?

Edit: Oh I also wanted to add that right now I’m making a big decision for my future. I have a lot of different opportunities that could all lead me down different paths but I’m trying to pick the one that’s the best for my future. Because of that I’m having a hard time committing to a decision out of fear that I’ll miss an opportunity by picking one option and not another. I feel like this indecision is also making me feel frazzled which is why I’m getting confused on my type again.

estp,"Whenever I take the tests or have people on the mbti subreddit type me I get estp. Lots of the stuff about estps does sound like me, but other stuff doesn't.

Here's some background which I think is probably pretty important. I was homeschooled from second grade to hs graduation. I was the kid who always got sent to the principal's office in first grade and my parents had enough of dealing with the principal so they homeschooled me. 

Being homeschooled was a double edged sword. You could work on your hobbies and have way more time. This allowed me to teach myself to play a variety of instruments and do other activities. However, You also got fucked over when it came to socialization. Me and my brother got addicted to video games and shit and my mom was too much of a softie to force us to do stuff so we basically did no social activities when I was a kid. This made me into a weird kid who also, at the time, had anxiety issues.

Once I graduated I wanted to turn myself around l so I did. I forced myself to say hi to everyone everywhere. It was kind of awkward but I killed a lot of social abxiety I had. I also developed bad habits like being a people pleaser. I did this put of fear because I didn't know how they'd react if I said what I really wanted. This kinda fucked me up in the long run. 

A few years after this I got into personality self improvement and I was able to toss out a lot of my crappy people pleasing fear based stuff. I still have undertones of this people pleasing shit popping up now and then but I hope to be able to stop it all together.


Which is why I wonder if I'm an ESTP sometimes. I hear ESTPs are supposed to be confident. I guess I am for the most part. But I think my childhood definitely has affected me somehow. I never feel lonely, but I love big social events. I'm a very talkative individual who loves meeting new people. I hate texting people. I hate people telling me what to do unless they can back their command up with $$$. I have no problems being firm with people if they awaken my anger, which is kinda hard to do unless I feel personally threatened. I don't feel emotions at all for the most part, which is something I see as an advantage.

I'm rambling but this is something I wonder about. Other personalities I've been suggested are ENTP, ESFP,  ISFP,  to name a few. I know they say your one type and you can't change, but I swear I've changed but that could just be me overcoming childhood anxiety or something",1612967063

estp,"**This is what I think makes acting possible:**

**Function stacks are permanent. However...**

Your default, **non-shadow-leaning functions are only preferences.** You can access the shadow functions easily if you try.

**ESTP and ISTJ** for example. **Think of them as STFN.**

Their default Se Ti Fe Ni and Si Te Fi Ne orientations are only that. Defaults.

They can access the extraverted or introverted versions of STFN if they try.

So like, if I wanted, I could **access** Se **Te Fi** Ni. **Still in ESTP stack order.**


If you want to **APPEAR like you are using a different function stack order, you STEP through** your existing stack and amplify the functions you want people to see.

**So if I wanted to act ESFP, I would have to:**

&gt; 1) **Amplify** Sensing.

&gt; 2) Pass through Thinking and keep it silent.

&gt; 3) **Amplify** Feeling.

&gt; 4) Pass through Intuition and keep it silent.

&gt; 5) **Back at the top of the stack. Pass through Sensing.**

&gt; 6) **FINALLY amplify** Thinking, so it appears I'm now going **S-F-T.**

&gt; 7) Pass through Feeling.

&gt; 8) **FINALLY amplify** Intuition, thus **simulating ESFP's S-F-T-N.**

For me to **ACT ENFJ as ESTP,** it requires less steps:

&gt; 1) Pass through Sensing.

&gt; 2) Pass through Thinking.

&gt; 3) **Amplify** Feeling.

&gt; 4) **Amplify** Intuition.

&gt; 5) **Back at the stop of the stack. Amplify Sensing.**

estp,"In Japan there is an ancient tradition of lyrical poetry known as ""Jisei"" translated it means ""Death Poem"". A death poem for those who practiced this art form would usually be written towards the end of someone's life or before facing a death threatening scenario (war, duels, extreme illness, etc). Though sometimes they could be written early into adulthood for it was believed a person could never truly predict exactly when death would come for them. 

A death poem could contain any kind of information but there was a heavy focus on a personal insight to the one writing it. This usually wasn't advice (though it could be) they were writing but just a gloves off, masks off, deep long look at themselves and their relation to life on some level as they saw it and taken out of themselves and written down for others finally to see who they were and what they thought in a land with a people ""stereotyped"" as being introverted and harmonious.

The themes and attitudes of death poems range all over the place: Longing, beauty, confusion, goals, desires, cynicism, bravery, love, depression, loyalty, humor, etc. There were rival schools of style in the teaching of how to write death poetry. Some schools of thought had the poems rhyming, others focused on lyrics related to nature, some on a audible tonality harmony, etc. Put simply there was no one correct way to write them and they were written by nobles, merchants, samurai, Zen monks, commoners, and men and women alike.

The death poems come in a few structures traditionally with three of them for example being; Haiku with 3 lines with a syllabic count of 5-7-5, Tanka (short poem) with 5 lines and a syllabic count of 5-7-5-7-7, Choka (long poem, and usually reserved for eulogies) which had the same structure as the tanka but just repeated the line and syllabic structure over and over again until the person writing finished saying what they had to say.

A few examples of death poems can be found in this seven minute video which also contains some relatively modern examples written by Kamikaze pilots before flew to their deaths on suicide missions in World War 2: https://youtu.be/Xp1xwzb4b8Q it also contains a few book references at the end for furthering reading on the subject.

Finally I know the subject matter is a bit morbid for most but I just don't see it that way. I am curious to see how you would construct a death poem. I am asking and encouraging people to try writing one as a mental exercise and I am curious to see if there are any themes that come up that seem related to type or not should you chose to share it in this thread. I don't expect anyone to present master level poetry as most people haven't written a poem since elementary school if that. 

If people choose to share please be kind to them and their work. Leave brutal criticism only for those who specifically ask for it.

Now take your time and figure out what you have to say. Be brave and test yourself with something new.",1612136072

estp,"Hello,
It’s me again. I would like to talk about my estp friend. It’s impossible to express my feelings, I feel trapped into this situation. Like in chess you know : if I make a move, he is going to eat my chess lady, and just after that, checkmate. 
To explain the metaphor, he is a player. And I wish I could be with him. I want to make the relationship progress, and go to the next step &gt; from friendship to a love relationship. I feel so silly to write this because he is quite detached. 

The positive things are :
- he is interested when I talk to him, even if sometimes I am sure it’s not really his cup of tea
- we call each other and it’s always easy
- we message often (almost everyday) and react at social media of each other
- he feels free to say what he is (even inglorious things)
- he said I was pretty
- he is interested about my past lovers
- he already invited me to come at his house several times (I refused.. you know checkmate ahaha!)
- we play online together
- he completes me and push me to BE more and to affirm myself (especially at work)

Cons are :
- he is a player, and I am sure he is talking to other girls. But I know it’s not serious, it’s just for sex
- he is beautiful and it makes me feel insecure
- he seems to be busy all the time
- he doesn’t remember everything I say (I personally remember everything he says)
- many girls are better than me, ambitious, sociable etc.. around him

Today, I intentionally activated tinder to see his reaction (it’s absolutely not my style). I told him and I showed him screenshots to make him laugh with some profiles. The first thing he saw on the screenshot was the number of « match » (a lot). But nothing else. I hope he could be a little bit jealous. I was upset the entire afternoon because of that. He just said : tell me if something happen [like if I have a date or something]. But that‘s all.

ANYWAY, point being, would anyone be able to explain to me why those cognitive functions in me are so.. variable? Or would be willing to share resources so I can understand these things better? Thanks!",1611535392

estp,"Recently I've been wondering whether or not I actually am an estp. I've always kind of been labelled by my friends as an extrovert because I am very loud and outgoing in groups. People who are a bit closer to me usually tell me I'm definetely an introvert. I enjoy being in big groups and I enjoy attention, but it leaves me extremely drained. I never actively seek out company, but I enjoy it when there are people around me. I try to get as much time to myself as possible, whenever I go on break I just don't contact anyone because I need that time to myself to reload. 

I've always thought I'm an estp because I fit the stereotype of loud, social and attention seeking (this sounds kind of shallow, I don't know how else to describe it). And I pretty much relate to other estp people in general.

However, when I hear estp people describe their need to be around others, I just don't relate at all. It certainly makes me excited and humans can be pretty interesting, but after about 3 hours I'm completely drained. 

I've also heard that istp people are very terse in groups while estp people are very terse in one on one conversations. In this case, I'm definetely more like an estp. It's easier to talk in groups because I can just go with the flow and jump in on random conversations, while one on one conversations usually require a lot of initiating on my part. I'm not very good at coming up with things to say, so groups make it easier because there's usually already an ongoing topic. 

What do you think? Obviously there are other factors to estp and istp, but the social part is kind of the only thing that makes me hesitate since I'm very socially skilled compared to other istp people I know.",1611414144

estp,"Hi ESTP squad, quick question. Anyone else here struggle with giving people second chances &amp; go completely cold?

For example: When people in my life deeply screw me over (ex. being deceitful, taking advantage of me, etc), I just go cold &amp; unconsciously cut them off. Even if I have GREAT history with them. I can't bear look at them again. It stressed me out for a little but after a week I just forget they existed. I feel guilty for being capable of this but can't fix it. 

I have always struggled with this &amp; have lost a lot of close people because of my inability to reconcile &amp; most importantly, my inability to give a shit about losing them. I've lost about 3-4 friends in 2020, and about 3 in 2019 because of this. They've all reached out to apologize/talk things out, but I ignore &amp; keep it moving. 

Recent Example: I was working on a passion project with one of my close friends (ENTJ) for the last few months. However, I was doing 90% of the work despite this being an equal partnership. He claimed he would do stuff every week but would never follow through. I had a meeting with him &amp; he promised he would change. But, I felt completely taken advantage of. So I walked away from the project (to his objection). Now, I'm much happier being independent &amp; doing my own thing but I struggle to be friends with him because the situation still pisses me off.",1611277132

Ok so if I like something I go at it. I just go by I like it or have an idea n jump in without much details.

Like I had a job out of state with no fam nor friends there n my fam n siblings were worried n I also had depression. My depression hit hard day off n I was arguing n crying but next day I was a soldier n hit a 16 hr drive. My sis was like what hotel to what is your plan I was like all I know is I’m doing Airbnb that is fri n Monday I go to work. No other thought.

When things get my anxiety I just pump the music up.

So idk if Ni or Te being my inferior...

Ni I just want stability n there are no details or nothing I’m working on. It doesn’t exist I think like that thought.

Te if I see something I like or click with it I go get it or try to by finding books n people who did it n taking that map they succeeded to use but I ususally get bored n drop it after few weeks.

Under stress like fam emergency I get mad first why am I here. Like I just wanna smoke n chill n not be in this situation. After that I become harsh with myself n others to give me facts n use that to get out situation ASAP.  I end up making it worse. My bro said I can’t handle when  life gets hard at all.

Under stress at work or fam I get paranoid everyone is out to get me n I gotta be ruthless or I won’t survive. I ususally end up working out while looking for an answer quick. I go to others for help n they calm me down n give me the solution. I always run to others to help me if things get worse.

I am very competitive and I love debating. I wouldn't say I am very creative, but usually, when working on school projects with others I manage everyone and give ideas.

I was genuinely happy for him that he found a girl that he really liked (more than me). I knew that he wasn't the right guy for me, but still, after four months of seeing eachother twice a week, you'd expect a more emotional response, right?

estp," I'll share a formal energetics assessment that I conducted on Donald Trump. And the personality profiling result is the following...

Donald Trump is a SEE/ESFP in reverse development with main enneagram 8w7. NiTe subego (channelling Ni inspirations with Te methodics) pushed by a submerged Se Base frame. Fi fixation.

IRL dimensionality of valued functions:4D Base: Se (submerged)3D Primary Auxiliary: Te (surfacing)2D Secondary Auxiliary: Ni (surfaced)1D Acting Suggestive: Fi (submerging)

On practical terms the resulting behaviour is an hybrid between SEE/ESFP and LIE/ENTJ. His strong tendencies of shaming and guilting others are an unhealthy expression of Fe Demonstrative. On top of that he has NPD.

Reversion is often triggered by trauma, depression and/or drug abuse. I suspect that in the case of Trump it was the latter to trigger the above reversion.

If you think that you can just cage the fluidity of human psyche in 16 boxes of stereotypes with all people following the same specific steps in development... And call it a day... You're delusional and you're vastly understimating the human psyche.

The human psyche is much more fluid and vast than systems like MBTI and socionics think it to be.

estp,"Okay, hear me out. I’ve always been really really empathetic, to the extent of feeling other peoples emotions more than my own. I used to think this was really weird, because I know I’m ESTP, all the functions fit me better than any other type, but the empathy thing has always nagged at me as a possible point of mistyping. 

I’ve been thinking about it more recently though, and I tentatively want to say it makes sense? I think my Se and Fe manifest in way which means I’m attentive to people’s reactions to things (Se) and if it’s a reaction I don’t like I’ll try to find a way to resolve it myself, even if it’s something I have nothing to do with and my interference isn’t asked for or needed. (unhealthy Fe I guess) 

I think it’s important to note I don’t know what to do with these empathetic reactions. I have no idea how to process them and I’ll often treat it the way I do my own emotions - Don’t think about it, joke about it, mock “chick flick moments” etc. This leads to a lot of overcompensating on my part - joking about not caring and the like - because I don’t enjoy being empathetic at ALL. That’s probably the trickster Fi at work, I’d assume.

Anyway, my point is, do anyone else’s functions surface in this way?? I know it’s definitely not the norm, but I can’t help think it’s some kind of really unorthodox loop, because I know my Ti isn’t as frequently used as my other functions - not because I actively try not to use it but because my day to day life doesn’t really call for me to process things that way - but that’s besides the point.

I've considered ESTJ or ESTP, but I am not sure. 
 

* He is very impatient and all about efficiency. No matter what he is doing he always try to find the most efficient solution. And he needs to see progression, otherwise he will get frustrated.  
 
* Hard working.  
 
* He can easily feel guilty if he feels like he isn’t working hard and efficient enough at work.  
 
* Very good at keeping focus. If we are working on something he could say «Ok, I need to focus», and then just shut everything out, because he needs to focus on his task. And he will get annoyed if people disturb him.  
 
* He comes off as very self confident.  
 
* Sometimes it seems like he tries to impress me? He tell stories about himself and situations he has been in that makes him look good, or talk about things he has accomplished.  
 
* He can’t stand boredom or boring people.  
  
* He is extroverted and outgoing.  
 
* He likes parties and meeting up with a lot of people.  He also often host parties. 
 
* Bad at remembering names.  
 
* Even though he is usually very outgoing, he can sometimes be quiet. It is like he doesn’t feel the need to talk all the time. Don’t know why he gets quiet sometimes. I don’t feel like he needs to be the center of attention all the time either. He is not loud or the goofy type. He doesn’t come off as intense.   
 
* High energy level. Likes to do sports.  
 At the same time he can be really good at just chilling out and relaxing.  
 
* Very good at practical stuff and enjoy creating things from the bottom up.  
 
* He is able to plan out things and see long-term consequences of things. At the same time he is very spontaneous. If he has some free time and someone asks if he wants to do something, he will say yes without a doubt.   
 
* Good at structuring tasks.  
 
* If anyone needs help and he is available, he will help.  
 
* He is good at keeping calm, serious and focused in stressful situations. When everybody else is panicking, he would know what to do.  
 
* He is good at advising people, and if he see something that can be improved, he will come up with a suggestion on how to improve it.  
 
* He likes to keep his home tidy.  
 
* If I am not sure how to do something, he will explain and show to me how it is done in a nice non-judgmental way. And challenge me to try. Even if I may fail, he will root for me and say «Nice try!», and maybe challenge me to try one more time.  
 
* He is good with logical tasks and science.  
 
* He likes adrenaline-rush activities.  
 
* He is very smart, and it seems like knows something about almost anything. He enjoys learning new stuff.  
 
* He likes a good debate and can be pretty argumentative and convincing.   
 
* If there’s something he is displeased with, he is not afraid to speak his mind and let people know.  
 
* He think it is better to ask for forgiveness rather than permission.  
 
* Does not come off as very emotional. But I can sense that he is deep down. I can see that he cares about his family and friends, and that they can always count on him. You can see it in his actions.  
 And he loves to cuddle.  
 
* Has not been in any long-term relationships. Don’t know why though. He seems to avoid anything long-term and it seems like he enjoys being young and free and focus on himself and his interests. But he also seems like the type that would take a relationship seriously and be loyal if he were to commit to someone.  
 
* He doesn’t seem very curious about people or getting to know them on a deeper level. Doesn’t ask many personal questions. But he likes discussions and problem solving, and he can talk about pretty much anything from politics to economy, to sports, to partying and drinking.  

* He always seek to improve himself and become better at what he is doing. He likes to receive critisism, because that lets him know in what ways he need to improve. 
 
* He enjoy working with personal projects, and he also finish them. Whenever he is done with a project, he always find something new to work on.

The reason I feel like I might be an entp is because I’m a very creative person and I love to argue. I often create stories in my head for songs and what not as well as draw comics, which doesn’t seem very estp of me. 

On the contrary, I dislike highly conceptual subjects like physics, calculus, or philosophy and prefer things that actually have a point to them.

estp,"Okay.. All I want to say is how the hell do I recognize ISFP from ESTP? Now I do not think by functions, but by behavior, for example when we first meet them. Seriously, every ISFP gives me big ESTP vibes, more to that though when ISFP is very impulsive. This also makes me ask a question about the Ti-Fe and Fi-Te functions. Yes, I know the difference between functions, but again, I'm talking about behavior. For me, it is really difficult to distinguish Ti-Fe, in this order (ESTP), from the dominant Fi (ISFP). Like Fi can sometimes look selfish, but Ti-Fe, in this order, can look like Fi to me sometimes, like.. they can look careless? Can't find the word for this. It's like ESTP uses Fe as its third function, so it may sometimes seem so. It's hard for me. Again, I'm not talking about decision making, but how can they be like when you first meet them or you just don't know them for so long.

It's a very stupid question, I know, but I don't know how else to ask.",1609421831

estp," This girl is very popular in school, due to being pretty, laidback, genuine, and kind (well, she can be a tad bit judgmental, but is generally nice.) She is open, down to earth, humble, and relatable, and comes off as “cool” (this is how many of her peers would describe her.) She can actually be a bit socially awkward from time to time, but she is very good at saving herself/saving the moment from being too awkward when this does happen, typically by making a joke. Her peers often remark that she has the “it factor” and that they can envision her becoming famous. She’s actually pretty quiet and reserved a good amount of time – she is not particularly loud, but people are drawn to her due to her beauty and she does have a great personality. She tends to make friends even though she sometimes does not speak a ton. She is willing to approach people and tends to meet more people through friends she has already made… she always needs time to go home, relax, and reflect at the end of the day. She finds it particularly important to have time to herself to relax, even though she can be ambitious and does have a work ethic. She has a large number of social media followers, and enjoys posing for pictures and taking pictures of herself.

She is noted by her peers for her fashion sense...she has her own personal style, and yet is very stylish/has great fashion sense. She is a trendsetter at school amongst her peers, and pulls together great outfits. She is also conventionally attractive in general (she would still be considered pretty without makeup due to the way her face comes together, but is also well-groomed and has figured out which makeup tricks specifically help enhance her facial features and make her look better.) She does focus on her physical appearance, as looking good helps her feel better about herself, and her mother has been clear with her about the Halo Effect being particularly applicable in regards to women – she is aware that those around her treat her better because she looks good, and knows that she will one day lose her looks and youth, which is partly why she ensures that she is enjoying herself. She always shows up to school and public events with a stylish outfit, and generally looking physically appealing, as it greatly boosts her confidence. She lives in the present more than anything, though she does sometimes sit and think about the past when reflecting, and absolutely thinks about the future, and where she imagines something going, though she is primarily focused on relaxing/living in the moment and notices current trends (though she is the one who typically sets the trends – she is good at envisioning where something will go.) She is quick to notice a change in physical appearance in someone else, or physical details (for example, she will compliment someone on a new outfit, notices when someone has changed their beard or eyebrows, etc.)

She struggled with confidence issues/low self-esteem and shyness when she was a bit younger, much like her little brother is now, but she grew to be more confident during her later years of elementary school and realized that she needed to maintain a certain level of self-respect in order to avoid being bullied/put down by others, and that she would truly feel happy and fulfilled if she were able to start thinking more about her positive traits and stop being bothered by what she was unable to fix. She is not as naturally driven as her older brother is in regards to taking a ton of advanced placement classes and being an overachiever, although she maintain a good GPA/good grades in school, as she does listen to her mother and is aware that college is becoming more and more competitive. She does not know what she wants to do with her life, though she is not bothered by this, as she knows that she will eventually figure things out, and in the meantime prefers to chill out with friends and enjoy living her life. She can struggle with completing her assignments on time, even though she is smart and does usually understand the work - her mother typically helps her out with this. She knows what her flaws are in regards to her appearance, and in general, though either jokes about them or works on herself.

TL;Dr: This girl is popular in school due to being pretty (she is aware of this, but makes sure to look good primarily for herself,) laidback, relatable, kind, being a trendsetter fashion-wise, and having ""personality."" She notices physical changes in others and lives in the moment, but can think about the past and/or future when reflecting, and is able to know/guess where something is going... she struggled with confidence/self-esteem issues but worked on her confidence as she realized that it would help her feel happier/better about herself, and maintains good grades in school even though she can struggle with completing assignments on time. Jokes about flaws, or works on herself.

-I am a very open person, make friends very easily, can socialise with everyone, but prefer to talk to my friends at parties because all smalltalks are the same and dumb

-I am a very emotional and sensitive person, but I don't like to talk about my feelings, I keep my face in public
 
-I am not very empathic, it's difficult for me to provide emotional support cause I prefer to solve the problem instead. But I cry watching almost every movie because of the sad music or I can cry because my new plant is dead. 

-I hate people who have to think for too long while deciding on smth, to discuss the same thing over and over again, cause I prefer to quickly make a decision and act and I don't care if this is the best one or not

-I am impatient and restless, if I doesn't understand something right away, then I drop the case. Especially if it's about understanding some complicated theories (I work in sciences so I have to read a lot of theoretical stuff) 
 
-I am good at solving problems of other people, I can remain calm in a stressful situation

-I can be rude unconsciously, I try to act friendly and nice towards everyone but it happens sometimes. If I know that I have offended someone, this worries me a lot (exception: I don't like this person, then I don't care lol) 

-My opinion about my own morality depends on someone else's assessment, if I receive negative feedback and criticism, I consider myself as a bad person and can fall into tears. It's also very easy to manipulate me by making me feel bad, it's hard to say ""no"" in that cases

-I can't stand people trying to show how special and individualistic they are.  
 
-I try to be tolerant and accept any point of view, even if it contradicts my principles and logic.  I think that everything on this planet is very subjective, so even if something is the dumbest thing in my eyes, everyone has a right on their own opinion

-But this doesn't stop me from provoking  discussions just by taking sides with some very controversial opinions. I just enjoy arguing (although I am not good at it and I am a bad looser who gets emotional) 
 
-I don't believe in mysticism and spiritual things, but I think a lot about the meaning of life and purpose of humanity

-I dislike breaking rules and make sure others don't break them too

- I am NOT into any sports, it's just too exhausting. I don't like risks and anything ""extreme"". But I enjoy playing guitar and have many handcrafting hobbies",1609273932

I am an 8w5, with 8 being common among ESTPs, and 5 being common in any ISTP enneagram. I’d say my capability to live in the moment is rather closer to ESTP type, as I can sometimes try to neglect the future, distract myself from it by looking for sudden immediate changes to keep myself busy and not thinking about what is to come. I am not a complete hermit either, like most ISTPs I know in real life or see on social media, but I do have tendency to sometimes rationalise and overanalyse things around me, once I am comfortable with surroundings and I feel like there is nothing that can interrupt my process of thinking. I definitely have difficulties living without any form of connection to people, but I am far from being the most noticeable or loud in any party or group activity.

I had a homeboy who I first thought was an ESFP but come to think of it: He's always giving presents, free weed, always making sure everyone's having a good time..witty, clowning around = basically overall a good dude - very generous when he can.

How do I know He's an ESTP?  
motherfucker comes through my door, flexes his bicep and says ""Alpha""..and then walks in like he owns the place and I'm there looking at the dude like "".......fuck it whatever""

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways: I fucked up.

As I said - he's a good dude, always giving and shit, I may have made the impression that I don't appreciate all he's helped/done for me.

Which if to be fair - it kinda is true (I function as Entj - ( = Fi feeling priorities are at the bottom - getting shit done is #1) so I kinda trampled over him, and just ""used"" him.

Used - not as in ""gain gain gain"" but more so like ""thank you, whatver"" kinda situation amd never actually made it know that I appreciate it (implies I myself understand that saying thank you is good)

I know he went into his Se-Fe loop a few times (give give give give give give)-type of situation until he burned out and withdrew to balance it with his Ti - at that point = he's nowhere to be seen for a while.

&amp;#x200B;

Now: I wanna reconnect with the dude but I'm cautious because I really did come off as an self-centered asshole and it's been close to a year? that I've seen him and I'm not sure wtf to expect, reach out or not reach out?

Early on when I met him - I couldn't fucking stand him.

However on the MBTI I get tested all over the place. I got INFJ, INFP, ENFP, ESFP and ESTP (in that historical order).

We as a family are very close despite him working and me in uni, because we have a lot of hardship to deal with together (very sick parent). But it feels like i'm trying to help everyone constantly and be there for my parents while he occasionally manages to be there (i also realize that i can become unhealthy in my priorities and expectations of others). 

Its just everytime he acts selfishly and i try to call him out on it he becomes extremely defensive and tells me that he doesnt like coming back home because everyone makes him feel like hes a horrible person. I get that we use different functions so to me it just comes naturally to be focused on those around me and helping them, and it may be harder for him to do. I don't want to make him feel bad, but it seems like he just cant take any critique.

estp,"So I was chilling with my friend in my car and while I was talking with her I see a car pull up to me, it was some of my friends I don't really hang out with me and I asked them to race with me. So we drive up to the border road and we start. I quickly pass them and they fall behind by a lot. I'm driving 160km/h (100 miles) in a 70 km/h zone (43 miles) and see a car coming from the other side. Then the blue rotation turns on and I see it's the police. I realize they're already going to write me a speeding fine and take away my license so I don't slow down until I'm really close to them. So we both stop and I'm like here we go. The guy tells me you didn't switch off your long lights, some other policemen write fines for that and just goes away and I continue driving. Lol.

I’m confident and dominant. I can be a bit arrogant. I like being in control. I like talking and being with people it’s fun and better then staying home and doing nothing. I don’t get emotional expect for anger. When I get mad I can lash out but I get over it fairly quickly. I’m not affected by sob stories. I don’t feel much guilt or empathy. I don’t like philosophy, just seems kinda pointless to me. I don’t get lost in fantasies. I don’t crave complaints nor am I affected much by insults. Me and my family comes first always. I don’t have trouble stepping over someone to get what I want or need. I’m not loyal to anyone or anything, I do what’s most beneficial for me and the people I care for. I refuse to get controlled by anyone or anything but I can act like someone’s bitch if it will get me a good result. I don’t have spouts of motivation, I’m pretty consistent. I have decent self control. I have a normal amount of anxiety, maybe a little less then average. 

This thing seems kinda bullshit to me.

estp,"o there are two concepts I've had in my head. 

One was creating a discord server with all 16 types (my own idea and I've not seen somebody else do this before me)

Create a youtube channel with either all XNTX types or to be different all XNXP types. 

So I just have this thought what if we combine them and have a youtube channel with 16 types. This would mean a balanced perspective from all the types. Types like ESTJ ISTJ  and ESFP will achually get recognised for once as most mbti YouTube channels are just run by INXP or INXJs or at most ENXPs. 

It will be intresting to see how the 16 types work together setting up the foundations off the channel 

Different types will take on different role while setting it up. This dosnt mean IXFP cant be a leader or a Perciever can organise the channel but I think there are different roles that will suit different type better. 

All types will be on at some point especially when we are making a video about that specific type or that group off type however only some not sure how many will for videos not related for a certain type. 

We will probably have a discord invent new typing methods and build a website in the future

I'd prefer most people on it to be 15-18 so please tell me your age. Not that I care to much",1608245154

just wana mention this title, because I didn't find it in this sub.i tell it brief by it's solution. 

the biggest problem come from our weakness.
our inferior function, Ni. 
that make us scary of
""what if i make wrong decision? ""
""what if i choose wrong""
the reason is that we don't know ""what we want""
for example,you don't know what kind of girl you want (and  proper one for you), so u will have lover after lover after lover ..... 
****the best solution is to pair(as friend or lover) with an ESTJ or ESFJ
(some one with Ne third/child function) 
they give you ""possible choices""(like 2 or 3 choices), and you choose right/better one and go for that.

estp,"Okay so here’s some context for you:

I’m 17f, diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder and have had symptoms of ADHD most of my life, and I’ve been interested in MBTI since I was about 13.

I’ve always believed I was an intuitive and never questioned it, but i recently learned the REAL meanings of N/S and came to realise I can see myself as a sensing type, which led me down an avenue of researching S types.

(I’ve generally stuck with the label of ENFP for a while but that never really felt entirely fair - I think i’m too selfish and my attention span is too short haha.)

Anyway, recently I started learning more about ESTP and realised, hey, this sounds really like me! Most of my decisions are pretty off the cuff, I’m not very good with authority/obeying it, I’m no good at sharing my feelings in a way that will help comprehend/soothe them, I’m good at noticing changes in peoples behaviour and often try to relate it back to myself (I get convinced people hate me very easily haha.) But then, thinking over it later I realised, hey, this sounds like a lot of the symptoms of BPD my therapist told me about. 

Any thoughts? Does neurodivergence have any sway on how you would type yourself or should you try to be objective and imagine how you would process things WITHOUT your mental illness?",1607397887

estp,"Hey guys, I'm an INFJ who needs help understanding what is up with an ESTP. The ESTP is this guy who was my chem lab partner last year. He was very aloof and distant and ""too cool for school"" (definitely typed him as an ISTP back then). I thought he disliked me except there were these times he would touch my hands while we were doing an experiment or get what I felt to be unnecessarily close (but I am also just extra sensitive to anyone being in my personal bubble). 

But then once quarantine started, he started calling and face timing me for hours at a time just to do homework together almost every day. I was somewhat confused as to why he was acting like we were so close all of a sudden, but his company actually ended up being nice. 

Fast forward to this year and I accidentally developed a huge crush on him :( He has continued to facetime me about homework for our physics class. Luckily we get off the topic of school much more often. We text every day and he almost always starts it by asking a question about our class. The thing is, the class we're in is hard, but definitely doesn't require work every day. His questions seem to be getting dumber and dumber and they're often things he could figure out on his own in 5 seconds. 

All of his actions seem to be positive signs, but I am confused because he is so hot and cold. If on the rare occasion I make an effort to reach out to him, he seems hesitant and distant. He is slightly flirtatious at times and brags a lot and always seems to flex in the camera by stretching lol, but when I have attempted (big emphasis on attempted) flirting with him by trying to start like witty banter or something, he shuts down. I will admit, I am sometimes quite cold to him (I am scared to death of the people I like knowing I like them), so when I do express warmth it is difficult to not feel it reciprocated. As someone with no experience in the romance department, I gotta know, what's his deal? He's a pretty confident, popular guy so I feel like he would have made a move already if he wanted to. Does he just want to be friends? Why is it all so academic? Does he just want help with the class? What should I do? Thanks in advance, I love you ESTPs &lt;3",1607195291

I'm a XSTP (either more introverted ESTP or an ISTP with a more active Se). In either case I was curious as to what kind of jobs/careers you guys have found yourselves in.

Recently got into tech (IT). It's remote for now. Lots of phone calls and sitting at a desk all day. Most people I think would love it, but I just don't. I thought it would be more field work. Getting to go and talk to people and fix everything. I just sit at a desk and call someone else to fix it.

estp,"My boss is about twenty years my senior and just exudes sensuality. There has been subtle flirtatious exchanges between us and I think she's just waiting for me to make a move. I suspect she's hesitant to take action because I'm her employee. Anyway, she's just got this sensual nature in her every move. I'm an ENFP and I picked up on her energy immediately but I've been silently observing for a few years. I just typed her as ESTP and everything I've read fits her perfectly. The only question I have is the sexual aspects as I've yet to experience her but they seem to fit my gut feeling. 

The few pages and posts I've read about ESTP sexuality indicate they are generally open to casual play, that cuckolding is a common fantasy (this fits my view of her). I just want to know more but don't know exactly what to ask. We're in a small office, rarely alone, she's married, I'm not and she's 20 years older than me. Really want to make the move here but want it to be the right move and right time. Feel that she'd probably appreciate directness but then I feel like the game is necessary as we're not alone to say much AND I fear my direct might just come out vulgar.

estp,"ive been on quite the slippery slope these last few months of limited social circles, lockdowns, etc. The money I would normally spend on new clothes, gas, takeout, is replaced by psychedelics or party drugs (aka anything I can get my hands on).

I go into work everyday, maintain family and personal relationships, pay 99% of bills on time, im mostly functional. I keep it under control and try to keep it recreational but every new thing that I try quickly loses its special effect. I find the similar thing happens with different hobbies that I pickup for months at a time. Heavily addicted to cocaine for 2 months and then one morning just didn't have the desire for it at all (not that that's anything to brag about)

I go further and further with dosage, yet there's always an unachievable point that I am trying to get to. Certain substances are a lot easier to OD on which is something I want to avoid, but I would guess I have a strong dépendance by now.

No one is forcing me to do these things, and they are fully of my choice; but at the same time, I slowly feel like the control over my life is slowly slipping away. I am in the middle of a career plan but I feel further away from where I was in March.

Is this ESTP style risk taking behaviour? I figured the best way to overcome something like this would be to do what another successful ESTP has done.

Anyone else dealing with similar issues?

A profoundly cringe phrasing, but do you relate? 

For me, my school is very cliquey. I used to be decently popular  in my previous schools and was known as the ‘class clown’,  whereas in this school, I’m an involuntary loner. Mostly because rumors had circulated that, in my old school, I had sexually harassed some girls, gave shit to my teachers, etc. Which is anything but me. I’m a cordial, chill person and respect my teachers. I’m way too reserved in class to speak out, never-mind the sleep deprivation. I’ve unified a group of friends, but sadly, the number of people in it is odd, meaning that I usually get left out when we do even-numbered group activities. 

And I’ll feel so emotionally struck when that happens. Some friends, huh? Don’t get me wrong, I can be a bit too frenetic, whereas they can be a bit more jaded. It’s not exactly hard to read it off their faces. They’re more private and just stick together to mull over the same exasperating subjects. (Games they’ve been playing on the Nintendo Switch, new games they’re gonna get on the new Ps5). I don’t mind them.

Despite that, I am a decent friend. I look out for my friends and don’t mind helping them out if they need it. But it seems like I’m just taken for granted either way. While annoying, the thing that is more depressing is the fact that it’s everyone. The entire school is filled with social cliques, carefree, excelling individuals who dazzle and are praised constantly in class. Hard not to compare yourself to others when the teacher is deliberately doing that for you. I’ll feel so worthless because of this. 

I’ll feel completely insignificant. And maybe I am.  But I’m just not sure what to do. I want to get into more sports. I tend to enjoy and have a natural skill for numerous sports, and I want to be able to practice that skill and enhance it further. Particularly tennis, badminton, and boxing. Maybe they can fill my life up with some things to increase my worth.

I’m a potential ESTP, but still need to check something. Thus my inquiries:

People call you those ‘stereotypical chads who dominate the social scene’. Any ESTPs not relate to this at all? Maybe more of a loner in school? Elaborate, please. 

Another thing you’re notorious for would be impulsivity. I, myself, am not very impulsive and am more deliberate. I always think beyond my actions and the sequence of events that could occur before making a decision. This may be viewed as indecisive, too. However, I have bad days, and where I get so caught up in the moment I jump into the present opportunities for action.

Unfortunately, I've got a reputation to manage as of right now, considering I'm an A student in AP + college level classes. The things I want to do, like go out late at night exploring, partying (obvs not right now bc of covid), just doing whatever random shit me and my friends feel like, are not common things done by my associated peers and friends I've made. 

Sometimes I find myself becoming bored with my friends because all they seem to do is sit around and talk and mope.

Additionally, my dad is constantly encouraging me to get out of the apartment and do something, but he doesn't realize that the things I want to do are virtually impossible in a rural city. There's nothing to do, nowhere to walk to. He also doesn't understand that the social life I want is not common among my associated peers. So he's pressuring me to get out and do something, but there's nothing to do, and the things I want to do are simply not done by my peers. 

I'm in senior year in high school so it's pretty possible that this can all change in college. But I want to know how to actually make friends who want to do things and not just talk. I can't seem to get that down. Maybe it's insecurity I am just now addressing?",1606189893

So, a friend of mine tested as ENTP (it was a couple of years ago and was on 16personalities) but since I found out about cognitive functions, I’ve been doubting if she really is an ENTP and am starting to think she may be an ESTP. I’ll list some of her traits and would like to hear if you resonate with her.

\- She is extraverted, outgoing and sociable. 

\- She likes to go to parties and social events, to dance and to meet people. 

\- She also doesn’t fear approaching someone to talk or hook up with. 

\- She is very caring to those she cares about. 

\- She is very rebellious and defiant and will readily break a minor law that gets in her way. 

\- She is very blunt and will call someone on their bullshit even if it’s in front of everyone. 

\- She has a bit of a “bullish” behavior that can be offensive to more sensitive types and I remember being trolled by her once. 

\- She lives in Italy and loves to travel all over Europe and to visit a wide array of places like beaches, cities, forests and lagoons.

\- We usually don’t have very theoretical and abstract discussions and I struggle with bonding with her more than with my Ne-dom friends (I’m an ENFP).

\- She is funny but her humor is more through storytelling and focusing on experiences, events and people.

\- She is kind of an entrepreneur - she promotes and sells cakes to help her financially through college.

estp,"· Very rebellious: she has brake checked a police officer who tail gated her, chased after an armed robber with a stun gun, cut a stranger’s cord because they refused to leave after closing while charging their phone, intentionally put multiple shots of caffeine into a customer’s decaf order for being a Trump supporter, disobey parents, has homewrecked a relationship, uses her boyfriend’s credit card without permission, has used a customer’s groupon without permission, etc.

· When she homewrecked a girl’s relationship, the girl confronted her which caused my sister to hate the girl and want to get revenge on her. I believe she was envious of the girl since she spent a long time lurking on her and even created a catfish profile of the girl years later as a way to get her real Instagram deleted.

· She went through a phase when she was 14 to 15 where she wrote a lot on Tumblr expressing her emotions, mainly about love. There were many posts where she wrote about crying in the shower, heartbreak, getting her trust broken, never being able to get over a breakup, wanting to get into an accident in order to erase all bad memories, being tired of everyone and everything, people not caring about her, wanting to find happiness, giving up, how she cares too much, etc.

· She still goes through random moments of feeling these emotions at times, but to a much lesser extent compared to when she was a teenager since she’s now in her early 20s. Nowadays, she’s more temperamental or gives no fucks.

· Has a history of losing friends and arguing with family members, especially parents. Our parents have an issue with her because she doesn’t get good grades, skipped school a lot, never meet their expectations, and don’t really listen to them.

· School was never her thing because she always got poor grades. She dropped out of college and decided to become a lash technician instead. She self-admitted to being a lazy, sloppy person.

· Often she bottles up stress and anger and the result is her being tired of everything. She says venting can’t recover a person, so she sometimes feels like packing her shit and leaving without saying a word because she just wants to get out.

· Not sure if she has the same fear now, but when she was younger, she was afraid to love because she feared getting hurt and she has high expectations of relationships because of movies. Her fear of getting hurt extended beyond romantic relationships; she also feared getting hurt by friends and family. However even though she stated this as her fear, she has never been single for even one year and if she is single, she always has her eye on someone.

· She has a close circle of people she vents to who are there for her, but also tries to never show when she’s hurt besides when she’s alone because that’s when she can truly express her feelings.

· At one point, her motivation was to be happy because she wasn’t happy with anything in her life and had a lot of problems going on. It appeared like she was happy, but she said it was just a mask and not the real her.",1606033141

But I’ve recently realized that on rare occasions that someone does really hurt me, I have to look at my ACTIONS and realize that I was hurting even if I didn’t consciously feel upset.

I’ve started a YouTube channel based around this branch of psychology. One of the main things I’ve been doing on there is breaking down music/lyrics through the lens of type, and you’d be surprised how much there is to discuss when it comes to the functions (and how they interact) manifesting through songwriting.

If you aren’t interested, that’s cool. Obviously there’s no obligation. I’m sure it would bore some of you and interest others. People are different.

But I’m down to break down any songs you request. And if y’all are down for it, I’ll explore more of that artist’s music and make more videos on their library.

[Here are all the ones I’ve done so far](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKy9JfrMugrK29I52hYQNcwmoYi79_ePx)

He said he really really loved me. But unfortunately, the way I see it, it was a trauma bond for him. Some unresolved father issues at his end and he would always try to be “good” for me, try to please me. If he upset me even slightly he would be too harsh on himself.

One of the most pleasant experience with a girl I have had (obviously gone bad but that's not the point) was with a friend of mine's sister, about a year ago.

We attend the same school, so it would've had been easy to approach her, yet I was (and still am, though much less than then) extremely insecure. I spent many months waiting, but then I did introduce myself. For me, the sole act of introducing myself to a girl sometimes seems like a reason to be proud of myself.

Even if it went bad, since I completely gave her up after discovering she was already engaged, without talking to her anymore (which still makes me feel like an idiot even if I am not at all), I still remember her with a smile.

Thanks to my conversations with her the most playful and ""dickest"" side of myself took over, and I really didn't care of what I did at certain moments, because it was funny as fuck. I enjoyed kidding and confusing her, just for the sake of playing around with her, it was fun to be around her.

Looks like I did the most important thing. I enjoyed the progress. What a good time if I think about it. Unfortunately, my ""love"" (don't know if it was real love but I idealised her too much I think) for her ruined my attitude towards study and I took 4 bad grades in a row despite being a straight 8,5/10 student overall. But that's life, that's the power of p\*\*sy dear folks.

Now that I have no opportunity to go searching for girls because of covid and online classes, I have been overwhelmed with nostalgia of some events of my life, and this is one I've often been remembering lately. I've even unexplainably dreamt about her last night, don't know why or how (the reminiscence I have of it is extremely vague).

This is a sample of the body language signals that you can usually see in an ILI/INTJ. 

For the analysis I used as an example the actress Aubrey Plaza (ILI/INTJ 6 sp/sx). She is one of the few ILI/INTJ women around (LIE/ENTJ and ILI/INTJ are the rarest types in women).

4D valued Base/Dominant Ni is by definition (apex of the ego) fully conscious in an ILI/INTJ. The other 3 valued functions (Te Creative/Parent, Fi Mobilizing/Child, Se Suggestive/Inferior) might showcase different levels of consciousness on the body mannerism. Occasional mixed  signals, especially related to 4D unvalued Demonstrative/Critics Ti, might be possible.

Whilst VI is useful, keep in mind that the body language can be controlled at will, modified by moods as well as it can be susceptible to feedback  when interacting with others. Most individuals don't know how to control body language and/or they will usually resort to using the default body mannerism as it's the least energy expensive option. 

Anyways counter-check the information metabolism by IM/functions slots just to be sure:

\-------

ILI/INTJ

Ego: (+ Ni) 4Dv Base/Dominant, (-Te) 3Dv Creative/Parent.

Superego: (- Fe) 1Du Vulnerable/Trickster, (+ Si) 2Du Role/Demon.

Superid: (+ Fi) 2Dv Mobilizing/Child, (- Se) 1Dv Suggestive/Inferior. 

Id: (- Ne) 3Du Observing/Nemesis, (+ Ti)  4Du Demonstrative/Critics.

Socionics quadra: Gamma (world rejecting, integrity seeking).

(+ Ni) = constraining own hot temper, these sociotypes prefer to advance gradually into the future, though may sharply reject obsolete ideas, criticizing past mistakes. Advancing step by step,  generally believes in the linearity of development, i.e. according to own deep convictions, it is only necessary to remove obstacles, remnants of the past, and immediately this will open endless possibilities for growth. This quadra is not afraid of chaos and upheavals due to knowing how to conduct own work under conditions of change, risk and confusion.

Hidden agenda: 2Dv (+ Fi) Mobilizing/Child (to love)

Socionics communication style: Cold-blooded.

*** Pls ignore delete or ask me to Deere if this is not interesting or appropriate for this sub***

This is after reading a lot of threads about the things about feelers that annoy/baffle thinkers (as an INFP I’m trying to gain perspective and grow). 

One of the biggest themes I see mentioned is that thinkers find feelers inconsolable and prone to wallowing, venting and feeling bad rather than simply fixing the problem.

Now as a feeler myself I find this interesting because I see myself in that description a lot, in terms of what I do PRIVATELY (and on Reddit of course), but I almost never wallow or vent about my feelings or depressive spirals (at least I don’t think I do) to other people because I know how annoying it is to listen to (I truthfully don’t love being on the receiving end) and I know how that comes across. However, I’m wondering if my definition of venting/complaining/wallowing is different than yours? 

For instance, I easily get embarrassed and anxious. I’m medicated and working on my anxiety with a therapist but really I’ve just accepted it as part of my life. I blush, have trouble maintaining eye contact, talk too fast and stumble over my words sometimes when I get really nervous or embarrassed. I don’t really try to hide it because to me it’s not really a dark emotion it’s just part of everyday life. But it can get a little excessive. Sometimes I’ll tell people, with a smile, that I’m a bit nervous or flustered or embarrassed so I apologize if I didn’t make much sense. I’m trying to do this less often, but does that count as complaining or wallowing? I never thought of it that way because it’s not necessarily a bad thing to me to get nervous, but others might think it is? To be honest I enjoy being a bit jittery! 

Sometimes to my friends I mention I’m slightly envious but not in a bad way, just in a way that motivates me to compete with them or the person I’m talking about (nicely). To me I’m giving them a compliment but it may come across as wallowing. 

Sometimes I do freak out a bit and have little “anxiety spirals” where I start panicking and worrying that I’ve done something bad or embarrassing or hurt someone’s feelings. In this instance I can be pretty unreasonable and annoying because I really make a big deal out of something small though it seems huge to me. I’m seeking relief from the anxiety when I do this as well as an objective opinion and reassurance (if sincere). This is probably the closest to wallowing though my friends have described it as panicking. Usually I do this without realizing because my anxiety is so high and has been since I can remember that I don’t even know it’s not normal. I’m trying to cut this out, because I’m sure it’s annoying as hell, but is this the same to you as venting? 

Thank you very much for your insight!

estp,I'm wondering because it's been happening to me a lot lately.,1604699161
estp,"I'm unsure of my type, deciding between ESTP and ESFP. This may be able to help me figure it out so let me know what type this situation sounds more like:

I was fairly young when this happened, 12 years old and in 6th grade. There was a guy I liked and it was incredibly obvious. I was extremely confident so I constantly talked to him and then told him I liked him (got rejected btw). Everyone knew and kinda laughed about it but there were two people who took it as an opportunity to bully. The girl did it out of jealousy, I'm 99% sure of it (she often bullied me for being ""dumb"" and ""bad at sports"" which I was better at her at). The guy, I don't really know his reasoning. It started out with gentle teasing which I was able to laugh off but they took it further and further to the point where they were telling me to kill myself. I tried to settle it by challenging them to a fight but they said ""no thanks"" sooo yeah. They were everywhere I went and eventually I gave in and told my mom. She told their parents and made them apologize but it only got worse after that. I started distancing myself from people and became increasingly angry and impulsive(this is what others have told me). I became so insecure that I deleted my social media accounts and didn't want anyone to see me. I became desperate for an escape, trying to convince my parents to let me move to another town. When I was told that was not feasible, I wrote down a ton of plans on how I was going to dress, when, where, and what I was going to say to people, and a lot more stuff. Before this, I had always talked to guys and ykk a decent amount hit on me. But that number soon dropped to 0. This obviously crushed my confidence even more. I lost all of my popularity and became a total loser. It's been a few years and I still haven't really recovered.

Oh also I forgot to add, they did eventually stop. The girl stopped when she got what she wanted.  The guy followed. ",1604690891

estp,I don't know much about this mbti stuff but it seems fun,1604256003
estp," So I have this estp buddy who acts quite paradoxical at times.

  
When I message him and tell him about things that are going on at my place or new stuff that is happening, he often just doesn't bother to react at all. In return tho, he sometimes messages me what he is doing but gets mad asap when I am not showing interest or appreciation...

  
The same goes for interactions and activities in person. When we (for example) watch YouTube at his place, he will show me tons of videos about cars and fireworks despite knowing that I am not interested in those. But when I in return joked about only showing him Space-Videos the next time we hang out at my place he straight up told me that he might just leave... like tf

  
Even when we decide on something to watch, and he loses interest, he just starts watching TikTok on his phone for himself, but lo and behold if I act this way...  


From what I know about him, he grew up quite independent and really didn't got much backlash or criticism at all. He also always had friends that are conflict-avoiding and rather won't call him out.

  
He also ignores and blocks even mediocre criticism, so there is no way to just trigger a self-reflection in him. He can be quite friendly and fun to do things with, but then he just randomly goes full egoist.

I know for sure he doesn't do this on purpose but this rather is just the way he is, and he is happy to start an atmosphere-crashing confrontation when even remotely criticized for it.  
At this point, I don't know what to do, we are friends for too long now, so I won't just ghost him, but his behavior gets harder and harder to ignore and I see no way to influence him at all.

I havent seen a gym since then either, and I'm not allowed to play sports. I've pretty much given up on myself and have gained 30 pounds, and whenever I try to get myself back on track I do well for around a week and then go completely off track binge eating.

estp,"I know you ESTPs can be pretty direct and straightforward. This is a trait I really like about you. But do you prefer others to be like that too?

Not sure on how to communicate with this ESTP guy, and how to proceed in our ""relationship"".

We've slept together a few times, but it has been a few weeks since last time, and I really want to sleep with him again. At the same time, I am interested in getting to know him better. I want casual dates. We don't even have to call it dates. However I think he can sense that I am interested in him, and I feel like he has been a bit withdrawn/cold and quiet lately. Maybe he is worried that I might develop feelings for him, and that is why he is withdrawing. And I don't think he knows that I can be casual about it and take it slow too. 

1. Is there any way I can express that I want to have sex with him again and hang out? Without scaring him away.

2. Do you prefer people who are direct and straightforward, or the more shy and careful ones? I've heard extroverts often like introverts as they are a bit quiet and mysterious. I feel like I could easily be both. And I don't want to ruin the tension and mystery, if that is what ESTPs are into.
 
3. Do you get easily bored when someone is ""easy to get"" and you don't get to chase? I feel like it is a bit too late to start playing hard to get. He obviously knows I am attracted to him, since we've slept together. And I am not a big fan of playing games either. 

4. Do you think it is better if I just leave him alone and let him reach out to me if he wants to? My problem with this is that it makes me crazy not knowing when or if I will ever hear from him again.

So how do you prefer others to communicate with you? Especially when it comes to dating and establishing a relationship.

An overview of the gamma quadra in socionics (model A)/MBTI. The delta quadra types are SEE (in MBTI ESFP), ILI (in MBTI INTJ), LIE  (in MBTI ENTJ) and ESI (in MBTI ISFP).

(- Fi)  = Minimization of negative relationships and experiences. Critical of evil. Desire to get away from bad people and poor relationships, as well as to protect themselves from enemies and adversaries. 

(- Te)  = Business logic of risk and entrepreneurship. Rejection of which is useless, insignificant, mundane. This aspect is valued as more important than accumulation and rational consumption. 

(+Se) = Well capable of defending itself and its position. Protectiveness. Ability to defend themselves against all force. Ability to retain that which was acquired. Social mission of purification (to be understood in both the literal and the figurative sense of the word). Restorers of distorted principles, doing all that's necessary to remove barriers and obstacles which limit rapid advancement. This quadra can be called the quadra of criticism and reform. 

(+ Ni)  = constraining their hot temper, these sociotypes prefer to advance gradually into the future, though they may sharply reject obsolete ideas, criticizing past mistakes. Advancing step by step, they generally believe in the linearity of development, i.e. according to their deep convictions, it is only necessary to remove obstacles, remnants of the past, and immediately this will open endless possibilities for growth. This quadra is not afraid of chaos and upheavals: they know how to conduct their work under conditions of change, risk and confusion.

The title says it all, really. First of all, to get this out the way, I don't put a huge amount of credence into MBTI. I've always found it a fun conversation type thing - a pseudoscience more than anything else. I don't take it incredibly seriously (I know some people do) because the variance and scope of people is more nuanced than can be captured within the generalization of sixteen types.

That being said, I sat down with somebody very well-versed with function theory and after an hour of discourse (she analyzed my mannerisms, what I prioritize in my life, how I think, how I narrate stories, etc. etc..),  she confidently stated that I'm an ESTP, which is not the first time somebody said this about me. I just never really paid attention to it.

Apparently, I got away with ENTP for so long (i.e. whenever I'd discuss MBTI with people) on the sole basis of me being a great conversationalist and understanding Ne. I grew up around Ne-doms and many of my best friends have strong Ne, so it was natural to develop and use it as I progressed through life.

An overview of the beta quadra in socionics (model A)/MBTI. The beta quadra types are EIE (in MBTI ENFJ), LSI (in MBTI ISTP), SLE  (in MBTI ESTP) and IEI (in MBTI INFJ).

(+Fe)  = maximization of positive emotions. Even small doses are enjoyed. Against the backdrop of the dramatic, turbulent emotions that always accompany this quadra, every small occurrence deserving a positive response is seen as an occasion for joy and uplifts their spirits.

(+Ti)  = organizational logic. They have a developed sense of duty, citizenship, and loyalty to the elected project. It is therefore the most disciplined and organized quadra that knows how to quickly rally its forces in the event of imminent danger or emergency situations.

(- Se)  = minimization of weaknesses, i.e. steadfastness in the struggle against deprivation and resistance against the enemy. In this quadra, the force of will is an indispensable condition for effective operation. Persistence, determination, endurance, and firmness are always the supreme authority.

(- Ni)  = desire to bypass danger. They aim to avoid previously committed mistakes. In their groups, experience, skill, know-how, and sophistication are highly valued. They feel confident in extreme situations.

&amp;#x200B;

EIE/ENFJ +Fe -Ni

LSI/ISTP  +Ti -Se 

SLE/ESTP -Se +Ti

IEI/INFJ   -Ni +Fe 

&amp;#x200B;

Hidden agendas:

EIE/ENFJ (Se Mobilizing): To be wealthy.

LSI/ISTP (Ni Mobilizing): To believe.

SLE/ESTP (Fe Mobilizing): To be loved.

IEI/INFJ (Ti Mobilizing): To understand.",1602759707

I couldn’t delete my account because I use my profile as a portofolio for my works. I stayed away from IG for 2 months, only keeping contact with my SO and closest friends to call for awhile. And guess what? I feel so free, I do still get lonely but It’s not menacing.

- how often do you guys use social media? And what for?

estp,"Hey ESTPs! I'm Derek (ENTJ). A few months ago, my friends and I created an MBTI-based dating/friends app called Boo. Some of you may have already heard of it (and know that our first version was actually barely usable). I wanted to let you know about it because we've made a lot of improvements since then and thought you'd be interested in trying it out.

Like many of us, we're hardcore MBTI lovers and enthusiasts and thought it strange that no MBTI app existed yet. We thought MBTI could fix a few problems with current dating apps.

For one, you are recommended people you’re statistically likely to love and understand effortlessly, instead of being forced to meet every single type of person. Second, you can save time, money, and emotional fatigue you would have spent on bad dates with no chemistry on other dating apps. Third, you can deeply understand each other’s personalities before you meet and in a way that was never possible before. And fourth, get in-depth dating advice and insight into how to attract and get along with anyone.

[Boo Telepathy Demo](https://i.redd.it/67a3g84qfvs51.gif)

Many of our users are using the app to make friends and foster deeper, more meaningful connections. We pretty much built this app for people like us, so I'd love to get your feedback on how we can make it better.

The app is completely free to use, with added features like Dating Telepathy that are part of a premium membership (to support our operations).

You can download the app through the Apple App Store and Google Play Store links on our website: [https://boo.dating](https://boo.dating/)

Surely there must be other stereotypes that I can avoid and maybe change up a bit, right? I really want to make this character authentic, but I don't want her to be full of so many cliches or stereotypes. Ya know? I want to incorporate something that seems real and brilliant. As a writer, I can get a bit tired of cliches and stereotypes.

On the one hand, I love that she’s always doing things—going to the bar (pre-COVID), the lake, pool, on hikes, etc. We have a similar sense of fashion, lifestyle and priorities, which I value since we can relate on those things.

On the other hand, I feel like she only has “friends” for the purpose of having someone to do things with—like she’s not really interested in the person/friendship, just what it does for her. Seems like she wants people in her life that do interesting things so she can also do/get into the interesting things and she has to be doing the most always, like it’s a competition. 

It’s just this vague resentment I have about how she seems to use people and is at times incredibly shallow. I almost feel like I can’t put my finger on it, but it’s irksome.

Example of her behavior: she’ll text you on Friday to see if you have plans over the weekend, if you say “No, you?”, she won’t respond, like she’s off to the next person. She just wants to know what she can take advantage of, not really any interest in hanging out.

I mean air filter swap, clean with a brush and toothbrush in crevices, check coolant, check tire pressures, etc. I maintain my nice video game consoles and controllers as well. Disassemble and clean and wipe with alcohol. I am not OCD. I just get a dopamine rush when my shit is all clean, topped up, organized etc. I dont freak my shit when I dont have time to do it immaculately, but I strongly prefer to be meticulous.

 I am the same with my body. I do 8 hour eating windows, no dairy, large amounts of meat, sugar, toxic cooking oils, large amounts of gluten etc. I do the same sleeping routine at the same time every night. I put on blue blocking glasses at the same time every night. And I lift weights on the same days every week.

estp,"What do you guys think about the INFJ social awkwardness, reclusivity, contentment with just sitting there, and the way we can be spacey? 
How do you guys see that? 

I am seeing an ESTP and I don't understand why he likes me, to be honest. 
He is outgoing, smart and confident. I am shy, awkward, and clumsy. And I am more slow paced, while he is impatient and all about efficiency. Often I feel like a retard next to an ESTP.

A practical example so that people who are familiar with MBTI, but not yet with socionics model A, can understand these concepts much more easily. In this sense I'll put also the MBTI nomenclature.

In socionics the equivalent of MBTI INTJ is sociotype ILI. In a nutshell, socionics wise, it looks as it follows:

Ego ILI: 1 Leading/Dominant Ni + 2 Creative/Parent Te.

Superego SEI (in MBTI ISFJ): 3 Role/Demon Si + 4 Vulnerable/Trickster Fe 

Superid SEE (in MBTI ESFP): 5 Suggestive/Inferior Se + 6 Mobilizing/Child Fi

Id ILE (in MBTI ENTP): 7 Ignoring/Nemesis Ne + 8 Demonstrative/Critics Ti

And in the model A grid you need to swap graphically the positions of functions 3 with 4, as well as 5 with 6, as you can see in the picture of the video.

Ego blocks in a nutshell:

INTx types: ILI/INTJ NiTe, LII/INTP TiNe; 

INFx types: IEI/INFJ NiFe, EII/INFP FiNe;

ENTx types: ILE/ENTP TiNe, LIE/ENTJ TeNi;

ENFx types: IEE/ENFP NeFi; EIE/ENFJ FeNi;

ISTx types:  SLI/ISTJ SiTe, LSI/ISTP TiSe;

ISFx types:  SEI/ISFJ SiFe, ESI/ISFP FiSe;

ESTx types: SLE/ESTP SeTi; LSE/ESTJ TeSi;

ESFx types: SEE/ESFP SeFi; ESE/ESFJ FeSi.

&amp;#x200B;

Dimensionality of functions:

Dimensionality of functions is the number of parameters with the reference to which the function is processing information. Each function can be well developed, to the point of effective use, with different methods and efforts.

1D (Ex) = experience.

2D (Nr) = experience + norms.

3D (St) = experience + norms + situation.

4D (Tm) = experience + norms + situation + time.

Overall the hardest to develop are 1D functions, as they require specifically experience / trial and error /detailed step by step guides.

For example on paper the standard order of strength of functions in an ILI-0/INTJ is at it follows:  4D valued Leading/Dominant Ni, 4D unvalued Demonstrative/Critics Ti (it's about as strong as Ni, but unvalued), 3D valued Creative/Parent Te, 3D unvalued Observing/Nemesis Ne, 2D valued Mobilizing/Child Fi, 2D unvalued Role/Demon Si, 1D valued Suggestive/Inferior Se, 1D unvalued Vulnerable/Trickster Fe.

  The enneagram (basic motivations), as well as non-typology factors, can influence the individual in how he/she chooses to develop functions.  These differentations can lead to ""pseudo-types"", with the individual appearing to have a different type on surface level. A lot of people mistype themselves initially to the pseudo type. Also a celeb can be easily mistyped superficially to his/her pseudo-type.

  Pseudo-types can lead to pseudo inter type relations (involving both individuals' pseudo-types or between a pseudotype of onewith the real stype of the other). At the end of the day it's the real sociotype that matters the most in the evaluation of inter type relations as in a lot of occasion the two individuals seek to get closer emotionally and psychologically.

 Socionics tackled the issue of pseudo-types by proposing different subtypes. Overall they're unnecessary as you can use the enneagram system is much better in highlighting basic motivations and non-typology factor can also influence the development of cogfxs. 

Just for your info I'll give you a list of all socionics subtypes:

\--------

First subtype: (I)Stype-Xi; (E)Stype-Xe. 

(Example: ILI-Ni; ILE-Ne)

Strongest function: 4Dv Leading/Dominant

Weakest function:  1Dv Suggestive/Inferior

Extra notes: 2Dv Mobilizing/Child boosted for its type.

&amp;#x200B;

No subtype: Stype-0

(Example: ILI-0, ILE-0)

Strongest functions: 4Dv Leading/Dominant + 4Du Demonstrative/Critics

Weakest functions: 1Du Vulnerable/Trickster + 1Dv Suggestive/Inferior

Extra notes: Very flexible for its type.

&amp;#x200B;

Second subtype:

(Example: ILI-Te, ILE-Ti)

Strongest functions: 4Du Demonstrative/Critics

Weakest functions: 1Du Vulnerable/Trickster 

Extra notes: Secret strenght in 4Du Demonstrative/Critics; 2Du Role/Demon boosted for its type.

&amp;#x200B;

DHCN subtypes:

Dominant: Use of Te and Fe outside basic roles for its type (strong correlation with E 3, 7, 8, SX).

Creative: Use of Ne and Se outside basic roles for its type (strong correlation with E 4, 5, 7, SX).

Normalizing: Use of Ti and Fi outside basic roles for its type (strong correlation with E 1, 5, 6, SO).

Harmonizing: Use of Ni and Si outside basic roles for its type (strong correlation with E 2, 4, 9, SP).

estp,"My experience with sticking to a habit is probably not that dissimilar to your own. You start out with all the right intentions, but somewhere along the line, the commitment to follow through disappears. Elastic Habits showed me that habit formation is more than just a binary approach.

Through Elastic Habits, I’ve been able to split my habits into a 3x3 grid of varying intensities by incorporating the following into my approach:

* Lateral Flexibility: A variety of ways to approach a habit. (So “Exercise” could be a walk outside OR pushups at home OR a session at the gym.
* Vertical Flexibility: Different quantities that you would do. (So 5 minutes or 5 pushups)

**The truth is that if flexibility is a core piece of your strategy, then you can bend your habits and goals according to what suits you best that day.**

I also use color post-its to track my habit so I can visualize my version of consistency everyday. The main thing is to stay consistent in same way for that habit to stick. I explain this further here - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFmzRSmDzcE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFmzRSmDzcE) .

After only knowing each other for a month we were out drinking with fellow coworkers, and I ended up spending the night with him. The tension between us had been crazy, and we could not keep our hands to ourself anymore.
The next day he was so loving, and we cuddled for hours, he kissed me, gave me compliments, and we had such a nice time. He gave me a goodbye kiss as well.

A couple of weeks later we were out drinking with coworkers again, and he invited me (just me) to go with him to a party with a few close friends of his, and his cousin was even there. So I felt like maybe he was interested as he introduced me to friends and someone in his family.
I once again spend the night, and we cuddled a lot like last time. He was very warm and sweet towards me this time as well. I am very surprised on how calm he were, and that he could just lay down and cuddle for hours, as he usually has a very high energy level and is quite impatient. I told him we should hang out sometime, and he agreed. It has been two weeks and he has not followed up on this though..

At work we act professional and talk to each other like we are coworkers, so it is kind of difficult to know if he is interested at all. We act like nothing ever happened. 
He is not really showing his warm and sweet side towards me at work, or seek me out to get to know me better or to be around me. He is instead a bit cocky, shows off a bit, and seems like he doesn't care much. I feel like he acts a bit cold. Sometimes he is even a bit quiet around me, not initiating conversations. However our eye contact is quite intense sometimes. And I feel like he is much nicer to me when we're alone, and he has even texted me a couple of times. Basically I am really confused, and I have no idea how he feels about me. 

I really want to get to know him better, as I feel like I can't be my true self around him at work and I become more shy than usual. I am afraid he thinks I am too shy and boring actually. So I want him to see that I am not that shy when we're alone.

Do you guys think he might be interested, or has he lost interest already? And where do I go from here?
Even though we are quite different, I feel like he is exactly the kind of guy I need. I can't explain why, and I am a bit surprised as we are so different.. But I really like this guy, and now I need your advice on how to proceed with this guy!",1600879781

Then he’ll be affectionate, touchy, do things for me with a lot more care, and give me long stares out of the blue. Little weird in my opinion lol What’s up with that, do ESTPs just go in and out of being flirty with specific people? The same thing happened before, so I’m not sure what to make of it. Don’t know what he’s wanting. just odd to me since I don’t think I have any other friends like that lol",1600109232

I remember one christmas going to my grandma's house and we chased my cousin down the street on his hoverboard. I remember when I was really young throwing mulch at a kid and getting in the principal's office and crying with frustration. I remember fights with my family members over the years, or whenever I've exploded at a friend. Stuff like this I can remember, and it makes me a great story teller.

estp,"I will show you exactly which type Chase Joseph Simonis is.

First of all let’s compare his body mannerism to Charles Manson.

Charles Manson:

[https://youtu.be/YxxH6xm\_ZVg](https://youtu.be/YxxH6xm_ZVg)

CS Joseph:

[https://youtu.be/gHWCn5-EWkQ](https://youtu.be/gHWCn5-EWkQ)

As you noticed, their body mannerism is identical… Do you know which type is Charles Manson? Charles is an ESE/ESFJ. Vultology wise you would classify both Charles and Chase as FeSi Directive I-I- with flat affect (at the current level of development in the above mentioned videos).

I used Charles Manson as an example to get my point across, but if you know any ESE/ESFJ in real life you can try comparing his/her body mannerism with Chase and you’ll see my point.. One of my parents is an ESE/ESFJ… Same body mannerism as them.

Let’s countercheck his functions just to be sure, because vultology is an interesting tool but cognitive functions reign supreme when it comes to typing.

Nova and Grimm, two former mods of his, released a series of videos backed up with proofs on their discord server, about the true behavior of Chase. The way that he acts on video and how he acts on real life? Extremely different.

This is one of their videos. I invite you to see all of them, so you get an idea of whom you’re dealing with

[https://youtu.be/rOw\_OHzZT2s](https://youtu.be/rOw_OHzZT2s)

*(1:14-1:55) &lt;&lt;He had zero schedule. Like that was why I was gonna be hired on... It's the fact that the dude couldn't schedule to save his life. Quite literally kept on calling me being ""Oh my god I'm gonna die of stress because of my scheduling. And you really got to start  working for me soon because of this"". No seriously, the dude cannot abide by a schedule. You make him schedules unless you hound his ass to keep that schedule. He is not gonna keep it and he is just going to do what he wants to do anyway.&gt;&gt; (Nova about CS Joseph)*

That’s not a signal of Te Leading/Base user. That’s the signal of a Fe Leading/Base (first slot in MBTI) with Te Role (eight slot in MBTI)

Te Role: *“It is manifested as a need to appear efficient, productive and knowledgeable in their endeavours, as long as that does not conflict with priorities set up by their base function Fe. For instance, they may end up defending a decision or action that is not the most efficient but it is the one they see as most desirable in order to achieve or maintain the emotional atmosphere they are aiming at (for instance, not be seen as hostile to a given person or group).”*

Which, in Chase’s case, the main priority is to keep his cult active and receive their adulation. As well as to milk them out of their money whilst not providing adequate  services in exchange.

Chase occasionally engages with Te Role, often negatively when he is anxious. That’s why he can give at times ExTJ vibes. When a Fe Leading engages in Te Role, their warmth is temporarily turned off as Base and Role cannot be turned on at the same time *(they represent opposite ways to the same goals).*

Chase is horrible at typing, not taking properly in account enneagram for basic motivations and that MBTI/socionics covers information metabolism *(it’s not an automatic skills detector).* Chase uses stereotypes a lot, making a quick decision about what he feels it’s the personality type of someone and seeking biased information to confirm his initial feeling. That’s congruent with unhealthy Si Creative (second slot in MBTI) in an ESE/ESFJ, relying only on own personal experience and disregarding others’ experience plus being closed minded at the same time. That’s why, if you don’t fit his stereotypes, he’ll immediately attack you claiming that you’re mistyped when it’s not necessarily the case. And, if you decide to have a coaching session with him, as pointed by his ex mods he will listen to you just a few minutes at max, then he’ll bully you into thinking that you’re a certain type.

As confirmed by Nova and Grimm, Chase lacks the sense of timing in planning. For instance rather than increasing slightly and progressively the price of coaching to deal with overbooking in that period, he immediately doubled the price of his coaching. Which, as they pointed out, it killed the amount of coaching requests.

Such a “world burning behind his feet” sensation is a strong indicator of Ni Vulnerable (seventh slot in MBTI):

*The individual prefers to focus on immediate tasks, taking things as they come, rather than try to evaluate the outcome of present trends. Inclination to tell stories or narrate events on a sequential basis, rather than outlining how one event led to another.* ***He perceives time in an undifferentiated manner: the past, present, and future are all perceived as being in or near the present. When talking about the future, especially one's longer-term plan), the individual treats it as if it were accessible today and often is not aware of all the developments that must happen first. He generally has a poor sense of how long things will take and what the best amount of time to spend on things is.*** *Therefore it is difficult for him to stay on schedule without extensive, even total, pre-planning.*

It confirms that he has Ni Vulnerable, meaning Chase has Ne Mobilizing (third slot in MBTI) with hidden agenda to be perfect:

*The individual deeply appreciates people who are full of ideas and imagination and who give them a sense of connectedness to what is happening ""out there in the world,"" even if this information cannot be applied practically at the present moment. He is even more grateful for people who provide insightful ideas and unconventional analysis to enhance what he is working on or going through at the present moment.For example you can notice this, from Nova’s videos, from how Chase is obsessed by reading “get rich quick books”. That’s a typical example of Ne Mobilizing in business.*

What about him referring so much to others when it comes to ideas? It doesn’t necessarily imply that Chase values Te. Chase has a very bad developed Ti Suggestive (fourth slot in MBTI) as you can notice the facts exposed in Nova’s video. Chase is unsure about his own thinking capabilities, even if he doesn’t openly admit so, and that’s why he refers so much to other people’s work.  It’s not uncommon to see that behavior in Fe Leading/Base users.

Yes, Chase is an unhealthy ESE/ESFJ. Looking at Nova’s video, it sounds that Chase has narcissistic-like tendencies (*with his cult acts like his narcissist supply*) and that he is a scam artist. We can infer that ENTP is a mask that he uses to avoid seeking help as well as to attract people in his cult.

Enneagram wise he is a 6w5 1w9 3w2 so/sp: *“A dutiful social warrior focused on security, with a tendency of spotting people inconsistencies and criticizing them,  plus enjoying meeting and charming people.*” So/sp stacking motivates him to be a social climber. So/sp individuals may lack warmth (check) and are often awkward in 1–1 interactions *(check, you can see plenty of examples in Nova’s videos).*

In the disintegration phase Chase acts like an unhealthy 349 *(competitive and arrogant; moody and irrational; disengaged and apathetic)*. That’s why some people think that he is a type 3w4 in the enneagram.  An example of his irrationality is claiming that the sperm stands up and becomes the nervous system, which it’s a bullshit, as Flowstate made him notice in the Youtube video **“What MBTI personality type is sperm?”**

My personal advice to you?  Avoid him at all costs, don’t buy his services and don’t give to him donations.

Feel free to share this post as much as possible so that more people are aware of the true nature of Chase Joseph.",1599940097
estp,"We all know how hard it can be to stick to a new habit. Picking up any good habit essentially lays the groundwork for a more successful and fulfilled life. There are, however, some habits that have a trickle down effect and make the adoption of other habits a lot easier. These are Keystone Habits.

Keystone Habits are those changes to your life that create a domino effect and carry over into other aspect of your life.

One of my favorites is Exercise - Studies have shown that people who regularly exercise tend to eat healthier, consume less alcohol, be more productive at their work and sleep better, than those who don’t.

Some of my other favorite Keystone Habits are:

* Meditation
* Journaling,
* Building a morning routine.

The incorporation of these particular habits in your day can have the most unexpected positive ripple effects that you’ll end up being so happy with. I explain this in great depth here - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-\_2KVEVh6A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-_2KVEVh6A). Give this a try with your habit building.

This is Franklin's five-hour rule: one hour a day on every weekday.

For many of us, our professional day is measured by how much we get done. As a result, we tend to speed through the day and slow down our improvement rate.

The five-hour rule flips the equation by focusing on learning first. 

I share my experience with the 5-hour rule here: [https://youtu.be/eszBE0JwsT4](https://youtu.be/eszBE0JwsT4)

By focusing on learning, it un-automates our behaviors so we can keep improving them rather than plateauing. Every event is an opportunity to improve. And by making the process of learning a lifestyle, it allows us to get so much more done over the long term.",1599588222

estp,"Tsunade MBTI ESTP - Naruto Myers-Briggs Types

Tsunade ESTP - Naruto MBTI

Decided to share and make my Tsunade post into a official post like the others I made in the past, so here we go, so many people are confused on her so here's my take. I'll do a more in depth analysis on here later on as well as I continue rewatching Shippuuden too. But here's what I got so far in Part 1 and beginning of Part 2 of Naruto.

Tsunade is ESTP definitely in my opinion. She's not ENTJ, not ENFJ, definitely ESTP and Se dom and Ti aux user. She lives in the moment and doesn't focus on the future much unless when necessary as a more mature developed ESTP adult herself, she responds to details in the moment that she sees and pays attention to and reacts to quickly and spontaneously. She's irresponsible and hates work, rules, paperwork and structure and struggles sitting down being Hokage and finds it very boring and mundane and prefers doing things for fun and desires sensory pleasures like gambling and drinking sake, any type can like doing sensory pleasures even Ne users can like physical activity and sensory pleasures like eating or drinking and play games, but Tsundade does it in a Se dom way and values sensory pleasures like a Se dom ESTP and SP as well, she doesn't like sensory like NPs do or other types do as well. Tsunade is very SP and Se dom like with her approach to sensory pleasure and satisfaction, ESTP fits Tsunade best in how she goes about these things and for other reasons I'm mentioning here for why she's a Se dom and ESTP. She's impulsive and hotheaded with her Se and jumps into things and gets angry at people that insult her in a instant when they say something she doesn't like and instantly explodes in the moment with her Se rage and spontaneity. She sees inaccuracy with her Ti and pieces together what doesn't add up with her Ti aux behavior and function. She feels and reads people's emotions a lot and felt strongly with her Fe of the two people that died she loved and moved her Fe love and emotionally suppotiveness to Naruto once she saw he had the same Hokage dreams and acted just like the loved ones she cared about that died as well. She cares about society values and emotional supports people with her Fe when she can which is fairly often for the most part even if she's overly more logical with her Ti more often in situations and more unemotional and logical and assertive overall as a person. Tsunade's balance for Ti and logical and her Fe tertiary emotion and feeling other peoples feelings and supporting them is a nice balance in her character and personality in the show and her Fe tertiary is a good fit for her as a medical ninja too. Fi users can be doctors too in fiction and real life, but Tsunade is definitely a Fe tertiary user and doctor in her case as an ESTP Fe user herself. She struggles to think of the future with her Ni and impulsiveness and hotheaded Se rage moments toward people, but when she does calm down she can read between the lines with her Ni inferior hunches when necessary as well along with her Ti aux too, but overall Ni is Tsunade's major weakpoint, even if she's a much more mature ESTP female and Hokage, her Ni inferior is somewhat developed and helps her with planning strategies and missions for people and leading others and giving directions and thinking about the future when necessary, despite this again though her Ni is a bit developed as a ESTP mature adult but she still overall struggles with Ni in general as I mentioned with my examples above. Despite this maturity in her and being a pretty good leader she overall hates structure and being winded down working as Hokage and hates doing duties and work and much rather would be having sake and playing slot machines whenever she can in the series.

estp,"Hi there!

I’m an INFJ that works in a small work-place, doing a job that relies heavily on team-work. I mean, team-work is CRUCIAL. That’s why we all try to maintain good relations, and as we (me and most of my colleagues) haven’t been working there long, we are also trying to ‘bond’. This includes at work, but other outings as well. All the people here are nice and genuinely do their best at this, but I’ve noticed their way to ‘bond’ is quite different from mine, and on top of that I’ve found that one person seems to really ‘drive’ the energy of the group whenever we’re all together, in a way that makes it difficult for me to relate or bond with anyone, not just that person. (I’m also the only introvert). I’ve kind of accepted that it will be harder for me and that’s fine, and at the end of the day I’m going to be different and that’s also ok. However, I’d love to get closer with this one person, who I believe to be ESTP, as I struggle with them the most. With everyone else, I bond and relate to just fine one-on-one (my preferred ‘mode’ lol), but not with this person.

I always get the feeling that they feel I’m too boring, innocent, and uptight :D I tend to lean towards different beliefs and ideologies as well, from what I gathered. Is there anything that you appreciate about INFJs that I could try to embody to deepen our relationship? Anything that I could talk about that would allow us to open up, and appreciate each other as we are? Anything I should be mindful of to not do around this person? 

I’m willing to put in some work into this, especially since our relationship is quietly and ever so slowly becoming bitter and frustrated. I’d love to be able to be more myself with this person, and to know they feel they can do the same. 

Thanks!",1599484058

estp,"\- Always speaks her mind when she has a problem with something. For example, a girl in our table kept accidentally interrupting her. She sassily confronted her saying, “Girl are you gonna let me talk or nah? You keep interrupting me every few seconds.” The same girl was also eating a lot of the gummy bears my friend brought to class. My friend then said, “Hide the gummy bears because if you don’t, she’ll eat them all by the time we get back” in front of the girl’s face.

\- Loves to brag about everything from her grades to her baking skills to how much she gyms. She tends to talk about how she’s a really nice, kind person. For example, she once took a survey for a stranger because she said she knows how it feels to not have people take a survey. 

\- She can be quite arrogant about her abilities, often bragging about how smart she is whenever she gets a good grade on an exam. Sometimes this arrogance leads to putting others down, like she once repeatedly told everyone around her, “You can’t do math” when she was solving math problems. However whenever she does poorly, she constantly talks about how she’s so stupid and how she’s sad. I assume it’s to get reassurance, but I’m not sure.

\- Always thinks she’s right. We’ve done group work problems together and I showed her an answer was wrong with evidence from online sources. However she refused to believe them and still stuck to her own answer, claiming that those online sources are incorrect.

\- Aggressive personality and goes after what she wants. She typically doesn’t take my food when I offer her some. However I brought in expensive chocolate for our class table to share, and she ended up putting them under her desk then asked if she could have them all even though the others in our table only had one piece. After doing this, she justified herself saying her family never takes free things though.

\- We had a class in the late afternoon and she left an hour early every class session to go to the gym since she refused to get home any later than her usual time. The professor passive-aggressively called her out on leaving class, but she disobeyed him and continued doing it, saying he can’t control her.

\- She openly admitted to being rude, but says it’s a good thing because people of her culture are extremely blunt. 

\- Often struggles making up her mind about a decision because she keeps second guessing. Always asks detailed questions for a long time and says things like, “Are you gonna be able to help me out? I can’t fail.”

\- Can get controlling in group work if no one’s doing anything, especially since she hates free riders. Once in a class, she yelled at a group member and demanded him to do work since he wasn’t doing anything. She said she can yell at them because she’s close to them (in her perspective).

\- She’s extremely playful, enjoys teasing/roasting people at their expense, engages in a lot of banter, is always laughing. However she can take her jokes too far and is unaware when people get annoyed at her jokes. 

\- She’s pretty impatient and cares a lot about time. The first thing she prioritizes with choosing class schedules is the time. She also rushes to get home. However with classes, she also tries to avoid professors who are mean.

\- Considers herself close to someone she meets only after a short period of time. She’ll only have spoken to someone in class for a few weeks then say she’s close to them. 

\- She speaks to strangers as if she’s already friends with them. The first thing she ever said to me when we didn’t know each other yet was that she isn’t forgiving me for not choosing the college she wanted to go to, but couldn’t get into. She once also spoke to a stranger, asking them about her favorite boy band and fangirling about them.

\- She does whatever she pleases to the point of even sneaking behind a professor’s desk to take pictures of his textbook without permission.

\- Doesn’t like acting cheesy or expressing things like missing her friends when they leave. However she’s quite open with her emotions, often saying that she cried herself to sleep or how she’s so anxious or stressed over this or that. 

\- She boldly cheats on exams, taking out notes when the professor’s close in proximity. She has also gotten caught cheating before, but lied to the teacher and got away with it then proceeded to brag.

\- Friendly, outgoing, very chatty, helpful, can be pretty loud, and can be generous at times. She has helped me out with homework assignments and given me free answers. She also sometimes brings food to share or gives me snacks for free (even though she gets them free).

\- Has skipped classes to drive 8 hours to another city in order to go to her favorite group’s concert. 

\- Cheap unless it comes to her favorite boy band, which she’ll spend hundreds for. She downloads free textbooks instead of purchasing them.

\- She said many people find her intimidating when they meet her, probably because she has a strong personality and already acts like she’s close to whichever stranger she’s speaking to.

\- Not sure if this is manipulation, but she wanted me to help her out with her internship and said she’s asking because she wants me to learn the useful information for my own good. She also kept trying to persuade me into doing the task, mentioning how all of her friends are doing it and listing reasons why it’s beneficial for me. Basically she reminded me of those marketing people who persuade sales.

\- She was desperately looking for a job over the summer last year because she said she can’t stay home all day.

\- Has given me unsolicited advice about paying my own bills to not leech off of my parents, etc.

\- Her school note are really organized and color coordinated, but her clothes at home are in a huge pile.

\- Enjoys keeping up with celebrities, running a celebrity fan page, baking and cooking, going to the gym, and watching anime.

estp,"i am trying to place myself somewhere so, be cool of you could explain your answers a bit as well and give me some perspective.

are you methodical in your thinking and problem solving? how often do you try to predict what will happen? do you like to know the theory behind the things you do?

when you do something, how often do you do it with a certain, thought out purpose? do you make yourself do things you don't like/are afraid of just to push yourself and just to not be a pussy? are you ""perfectionist""? would you say you are an organized person, in any way?

an edit, i didn't ask the right questions:
when i say methodical, i mean this: for example, you are working on solving a problem, analyzing it; you take each piece of the problem and think about why does it exist and how does it relate to other pieces of the problem, and then you try to sort them in a useful way?

when i ask if you do things with a purpose, i don't necessarily mean it is planned; more like, i will do X thing because Y reason; the question after this one is a good example of it.

when i say perfectionist, i don't necessarily mean good grades and the similar. i mean, you are doing something that you deem valuable for any reason, and you won't rest until it was done perfectly. for example, you didn't like all of the subjects at school so you don't care about them and have so-so grades, but there are a few subjects that interest you and you give it all to not just learn the school material, but also to thoroughly understand the subject itself, outside of the scope of the school curriculum.

and finally, when i say organized, i don't mean tidy; i mean there is an underlying structure or system to the things you do. example, your room isn't tidy, but there is a system by which you place things in it, it's not all just a jumble of carelessly piled things.",1599462492

so, i (male istp) grew up with and intp, and entp and an intj so i was mostly distant from other Se types, but i watched and analyzed them from afar. at first, i had mixed feelings about you. then i explicitly disliked you to the point of serious bias, and now i have mixed feelings again (most likely from the excess N circlejerk i was surrounded with). i know you guys can come off as assholes a lot, in the way of making fun of other people and sometimes bullying. as for bullying, i am pretty clear on that, but, making fun of people and such - is it malicious? or is it just for fun with zero purpose of hurting someone?
and i have noticed estps dismiss learning new concepts, mostly in school (i know that lectures can be incredibly boring) but those subjects can still be interesting themselves, so my question is - do you guys really just don't care about that kind of knowledge? 
lastly, Se types are known for taking things at face value. how often do you ask yourself why is something like it is, how often do you try to prt deeper into what is around you (from things to people)?

I always spend time planning an activity or my day. Sometimes i catch myself spending 2-3 hours just in planning mode and have to tell myself ""just do it, you'll figure it out as you go"". I'm curious how you make you whole lives like that.  Thanks for that inspiration 😎👍",1599406068

She has road rage - will roll down windows to yell at slow drivers. Terribe listener but knows the right words to get me out of my bad moods/low confidence. 

She's a DOER! I wish i could start things immediately instead on endless planning in my head.

Loves the finer things in life but is also knowledgeable in almost every subject. 

I think ES types can make friends anywhere/anyone. She makes friends with homeless people/janitors, politicians or anyone in 'high places' (but usually because they can be useful/ helpful to her later in life)
- which i dont agree with, idk i kinda see that as using people.

The ESTP im interested in likes me but i can tell is impatient about my lengthy texts and slowness to meet. I like to feel a person out before hanging out. I really fear that he's the flighty type that will move on to the next best thing if he's bored.

Some signs he may like me (or maybe this is how an ESTP always acts)

* always say hi to me, though he doesn't really try to have a convo most of the time
* always seems pretty happy to see me(?)
* says my name a lot
* notices small things, e.g, when I straighten my hair 
* compliments me 
* sometimes sends me random texts outta the blue
* when I text him, he texts me back almost immediately (but that might be because he's always on his phone)
* gets real pissed when someone jokes about him liking me, but is totally cool with someone joking about him liking someone else
* randomly make eye contacted with me
* randomly tries to talk to me

Some signs he doesn't like me

* roasts me (we're frienemies, make sense cos I'm an ENTP)
* acts kinda different around me
* sometimes if I'm in a group of friends, kinda ignores me 
* jokes about how dumb and lonely I am but also about how cool I am 
* doesn't really make an effort to keep a conversation going

estp,"I'm an ENFP and I am active here and in the main ESTP Facebook group. One thing I have noticed that I found interesting is that in this subreddit, ESTPs often list ENFPs and/or INFPs as one of their favorite types. However in the ESTP Facebook group, people often list xNFPs as their least favorite type. 

I have a hypothesis on this and wanted your feedback. I saw a political poll in this sub once and it seemed like the majority of users here lean left, whereas in the fb group, it seems that the vast majority of ESTPs lean right. The majority of xNFPs are also left leaning, and political disagreements often trigger Fi which is your PoLR function and generally ESTP's biggest gripe about xNFPs is that we're overemotional and illogical. 

So my hypothesis is that members of the fb group are likely to have more value differences with most xNFPs, and as a result get more Fi rants which makes us seem unbearable to the ESTP. What do you think? If you love or hate most xNFPs, do you tend to share more or less values with them?",1599207114

estp,"HI so recently my personality and behaviors have changed A LOT but that's really another subject which im not going to talk about rn so nevermind about it - but basically i took several personality type and cognitive function quizzes anddd my Se is VERY HIGH (so is my Ne tho), my Ti is higher than Te, but Fi is higher than Fe which makes me dabble between esfp and estp althooough its more likely i am an esfp because i have higher fi than ti

Anyway, at first i was positive i was an estp because generally it suited me with the descriptions of estp saying they are abrasive, impulsive, adventurous, logical etc but that was ONLY THE SURFACE OF THE TYPE which i realised more and more as i read about estp through quora and reddit, from people who are estps which lead me to the conclusion i might not actually be an estp because y'all are kinda no bs type of people with stoic faces and...theres an aura about you im not sure how to describe. You mostly talk with short sentences and its like you are only here to ask specific questions and make a few jokes and then leave jfskdfjls

moving on, i thought i could be an estp due to said reasons - i can be abrasive, sometimes really insensitive and whatnot BUT generally i am very hyper, expressive and cheerful in a non-estp way + i really enjoy dressing up and wearing a lot of ""kawaii"" things which is a thing i noticed that estp females dont really do or enjoy but esfps do lol. But then again, despite the cute style i don't really mind being offensive or rude unless they are people i really love. 

One thing that made me doubt if i am an esfp is i am mostly very confident and extraverted buuut there are also times i get shy and introverted. Also i really value what I think and my own values, i won't do anything if they go against my own principles even if they are commonly accepted norms.

You guys sometimes might look like Te users because you wanna get things done and over with more with Se handling things quickly in the moment and details and your Ti makes you logical and focus on systems and look at logical details and want to question things and find accuracy with everything and with y'all being called the Doers too. But Ti in ESTPs isn't as obvious sometimes as it is the other Ti users like ISTPs or INTPs and ENTPs too, so please describe Ti in your life as an ESTP please. I overall know how it works with y'all but sometimes I get confused with y'all but of how straight forward and blunt your personality type works sometimes, its prob also why ESTP characters get mixed up with EXTJs so much as we see today. But you definitely use Ti and I see it too but wanna know in depth how it comes out from a ESTPs mouth and opinion from their experience in life, also since Ti and Fe are on a axis together too why not explain Fe ter in your life as well if you want?

he (obviously) flirts with me but I think it's harmless because he often states that he has other women to have sex with. 

I decided to stop texting so much and just hang out whenever we want to keep it more casual. 

Somehow texting everyday is a way to get used to talk to the other person everyday. And I know if I walk away, he'll get over it fairly quickly. I may need more time because we actually get along well and if a friendship is possible, I'll gladly have it. 

Is my logic completely off there? Can you be genuinely friends with the people you flirt with?",1598041477

estp,"**What makes you angry?**

I get angry when people don’t listen when I advise them to do something that I know is for their own good. I also dislike laziness, pushovers, getting treated badly by people who I treated well, and people who aren’t independent.

**What do you like/dislike most about yourself?**

I like that I’m strong, independent, aggressive, good with money and investments, intelligent, outgoing, cheerful, funny, easygoing, and a good cook. I dislike that I was born with low energy  and bad health because it affects my ability to make more money. However, I wasn’t smart with money when I was younger (in my teen and young adult years) because I didn’t care about anything at all and I was extremely simple. I just lived day by day without caring about responsibilities even though I did still get all my work done and excelled in school.

**Do you care about being fashionable? why/why not?**

When I was young, I used to wear makeup and dress up in nice clothes because I liked impressing others. Now that I’m older and already a mom, I don’t care about looking good. I just want to be comfortable. When I shop, I look for comfort and cheap deals, often buying things that I don’t need just because the sale is good.

**What makes you feel secure?**

I feel secure when I have good investments, a lot of money, high savings, hardworking children who are married with kids, and when I’m careful about things. Because I’m paranoid of COVID, I get a sense of security from shopping for high quality masks, hand sanitizers, and staying at home. Also, when I shop for items, I have to triple check every detail to make sure it’s the right thing and that nothing is a scam.

**What do you spend the most time thinking about?**

I spend most of my time thinking about money and health. I really love reading health books and watching videos about health posted by doctors. I also always tune in weekly for this talk show that teaches people about investments, savings, and other tips when it comes to finances. I also spend a lot of time worrying about my children’s future. Aside from that, I like to find new recipes for different food I can try cooking, but I don’t listen to the directions at all. I will simply get a brief idea of how to cook it then do everything on my own without instructions. I find following recipes exactly how they should be annoying and tedious, so I usually just do taste tests.

**How do you respond to clingy people?**

My husband is pretty clingy and dependent on me, which can get annoying sometimes because I want everyone to be independent. I don’t have any strong opinion on clinginess, but I do value the freedom of doing things on my own at times and don’t like when people ask me things like where I’m going or when I’ll be back home.

**When you are romantically interested in an individual, how do you generally act (shy, outgoing, annoying, etc.)?**

When I was young, I was shy and didn’t talk to my crushes. I just admired them from afar. I got married at age 18, so I can’t say how I’d act around a crush nowadays. However, all of my shyness was in the past and I’m extremely outgoing now. In my marriage, I typically try to be in charge, but sometimes my husband calls the shots since I can’t get everything my way.

**What portrayal of the future do you like the best?**

My biggest wish is to hit the lottery then own a hotel and a big house with a car. I also want all my of children to be married, have their own children, have good jobs, and have good health.",1597989637

Like sure, I’m not stupid - I know people are different.

Or for them to make a big deal of something I think is casual / not a big deal. It just like, blows my mind, and I don’t think it’s in a good way.

I have to work on being more respectful of these differences but I almost don’t know how, especially when the results of what they do or think have very negative results on themselves or other people. It can be hard . Anyone else?

estp,"LOONNNGGG post to follow. I’m a wordy- ass ESTP, arrest me and throw me in jail. Anyway, I’ve always loved the movie Forgetting Sarah Marshall, but most people I know found it just meh. I have a theory about why I love that movie even if most people don't. I’ve been seeing a lot of INTP/INFP posts lately, and then I saw the cliff jumping post today on this sub and that movie just randomly sprang to mind. I think the love interest, Rachel (played by Mila Kunis, a possible ESTP in real life) might just be the elusive movie character SheSTP. My best guess for the main character, Peter Bretter (Jason Segal’s character), is INFP, but this isn’t about him right now. 

Rachel ended up in Hawaii because she is adventurous and impulsive. She quit school to go to Hawaii with her boyfriend (who cheated on her, and who she starts yelling at mid-conversation when she sees him again when she's with Peter). A dominant Se user would never run out of things to do in Hawaii, which is why I would go. Rachel does a big ESTP  when she  jumps off a cliff into the ocean, a move she hopes will cheer Peter up and shake him out of his sadness and put him back on earth.

It warms my lukewarm soul when Peter meets Rachel for the first time upon checking into the hotel where she works, and Rachel casually gives him a special suite. She could get in trouble (she mentions that), she barely knows the guy, but she can read him right away and takes action (Se, Ti, Fe working together). She shows Peter care from their first interaction, and continues to show it casually and without being overly demonstrative. In the end she does a big thing, but even that is low key. 

I especially liked their dialogue as they got closer because it wasn’t…...romantic. It wasn’t dramatic. They both just wanted to keep seeing each other without the need  for a big speech or swelling music. I can see how  most people are ""just ok"" on that movie, but it always struck a chord with me. To be a SheSTP who is also that good-looking -who could ever be mad at you?",1597552204
estp,"So I'm a male in my late 20's, and two years ago I began working at this upscale retail store in the Health/Beauty department..

it was great, until about one year later myself and another coworker were moved into the Grocery department because that's where hours were needed.

The manager there was definitely the complete opposite of the woman that managed Health+Beauty... this guy was my age (late 20's), and was insensitive, never showed appreciation or encouragement, literally always serious with me, never said hello to anyone... clearly an emotionally unhealthy person. I'm the opposite of all that, so you can imagine we clashed a lot.

So my time in Health+Beauty, one full year, I was never written up and never had any conflict with management...

I was in Grocery for 8 months and written up 4 times, and fired...

This Grocery manager, let's call him Shawn, would micromanage and constantly get on me for the most minor of things...

I would politely tell him via email how much this stresses me out since I'm a sensitive person...

His response to that would be to be calm and sensitive for one day, and then revert back to his harsh intense demeanor...

he actually amped up his intensity and would be even more overbearing on me, and before I knew it I was called in for a writeup...

didn't organize the aisles perfectly...

I didn't clean the shelf strips how he wanted... I thought he meant sanitize them, when apparently he meant to clean off the sticker residue and to him it's a ""black and white issue""

He also loosely manages health/beauty and wrote me up for not fully working backstock, like excess product we keep in the warehouse. The assistant manager never said it was wrong to work backstock this way.

After two months of adapting once again, being completely focused and working with all my heart, he wrote me up for missing literally two items in backstock... this was a week where I was tasked with working like five literal times more backstock than usual because we were short-handed... i remember it being like 100 degrees back there and climbing up in these bays and i just missed two items in the back.

And then about two weeks later, I decided to take one extra 15 minute break because somebody called off and I had twice the work to do, and didn't see me getting out on my scheduled time... that was apparently the straw that broke the camels back, because the next day i was fired... this was an issue one year ago, but not this year.

The greatest injustice is that ALL of these writeups were during times where I was very distraught, stressed out due to Shawn being so intense with me...

he made me feel like I was always walking on eggshells. He doesn't see that he could be an efficient manager and still be gentle hearted and uplifting and encouraging.

I told Shawn numerous times all year long how it's a very tough time outside of work. I cried at work numerous times due to Shawn's intense behavior... even aside from that, his write ups were not fair.

Around my second writeup I had a strong feeling that Shawn was already planning to fire me through these unjust writeups...

I told HR and emailed regional HR a very thorough detailed statement to undo these writeups, and she told me she was unbiased yet did not remove any of them.

I built such a strong case for myself and store management and local HR, even Shawn told me that they are not wanting to fire me, but they did...

They gave me such a stronger level of scrutinization, and anybody would be fired if they received my level of scrutiny... yet nobody did.

I corrected myself every time after each writeup, and they found something else to write me up for that was so minor.

It felt like no matter how hard I worked, it was never good enough and they were going to fire me eventually no matter how hard I work. I believe they all conspired to fire me.

I believe Shawn wanted me out. I was the odd guy out who was a gentle-hearted person. They want the opposite, like a military mindset. I was outstanding with customer service and progressed by leaps and bounds after each writeup and it was always overlooked how much stress Shawn put me through, how much unfair intense scrutiny he gave me.

Why does it seem I was fired? Does this seem unfair? 

All the store managers and HR think my writeups and termination are justified, while everyone I talk to outside of that sees it as totally unfair.",1597522945

There's the typical ESTP hobbies we keep hearing in stereotypes over and over again, like playing sports, but as we are all a product of our environment as well as our type, I was wondering what atypical hobbies you guys picked up along the way.

I think my most atypical hobby is painting. Many people in my family love painting and have it as a hobby, so I learned this skill when I was little and kept practicing painting and drawing throughout my childhood. When I moved out to go to university, I didn't really have room, money or supplies so I stopped practicing painting. However, about 3 years ago I dated an ESFP who's biggest hobby was painting and making art, so she got me enthusiastic about it again and I have been since. I just like creating stuff and in that fashion it's not really different from carpentry, which is a hobby of mine as well.

estp,"Understanding which environments your personality and behavior is most suited for can be a tricky thing. So many of us are stuck in roles that require us to perform functions that aren’t completely in our wheelhouse instead of playing to our strengths.

The DISC Personality Theory showed me that I, and everyone else, have a natural predisposition for certain work environments and job functions. It’s always better to play to your strengths rather than try to compensate for your shortcomings.

Each person’s type is generally based on how outgoing or reserved they are, and how people-oriented or task-oriented that are.

As he has a very optimistic approach to life and is faaar more socially and emotionally intelligent; ive found that ive learned quite alot from him. Yet ever since a month or two ago (the end of the honeymoon stage of our relationship) Ive noticed that ive gone back to the same habits. 

Since hes been in my life ive had much more real people around me. I learned the definiton of real friendship and the lengths friends go for eachother. Now he is an ENFP and it isnt surprising how he constantly and easily makes deep emotional connections with people. Is that why his friendships are so healthy? Because hes a good friend himself?

estp,"Hey everyone.

My name is Oliver Powell. I'm a psychologist and my personality type is is ESTP 8w7 sx/sp.

I wanted to give all of you a warning, as I ran a check on the YouTuber CS Joseph and I found out that he's full of bullshits. He is a con artist and he is horrible at typology.

1. MBTI is about cognitive preferences. It doesn't automatically equal skills. Chase doesn't keep that in mind, so he ends up using a lot of bullshit stereotypes. No wonder that he mistypes a lot of people.
2. Any combo of enneagram and MBTI is possible. Enneagram covers basic motivations... But he disregards the enneagram, fusing automatically basic motivations within cognitive functions, ending up easily mistyping people. For instance he insists in claiming that Frank James is an INFP, when Frank James is an INFJ with enneagram 4w5.
3. Some of the concepts that he talks about are in a nutshell a bastardized version of socionics model A, but repackaged with different terminology. For instance his ""four sides of the mind"" are called in socionics model A as ego block, id block (unconscious ego), super id block (subconscious ego) and superego block.
4. He isn’t an ENTP as he claims. Chase is an unhealthy ESTJ (ego Te Si Ne Fi) 6w5 SO 613 often stuck in Te-Ne loops and on top of that he has most likely ASPD.

First of all Chase is a Te Dom:

4D valued Leading/Dominant Te: ""*Extroverted logic as base function is manifested as a need to accumulate factual information, also from external sources such as books, second-hand information, etc, on matters of personal interest or of professional activity. This also gives these types confidence on being well-informed on the same matters, which enables them to enter arguments related to them with confidence on their knowledge, which may come across as arrogance to others. Another manifestation is an evaluation of external reality - work activities, world events, finances, procedures, personal relationships, conversations - from the point of view of factual accuracy and ""making sense"" and efficiency. It leads to an inclination to be proactive in increasing the efficiency and reasonableness of the external world, as well as a sense of self-worth connected on being involved and productive in activities seen as useful, profitable, or that increase one's knowledge base. To give out information that the individual knows not to be factually accurate is disturbing and avoided as much as possible.""*

His second slot Si is poorly developed and he often turns it off, enganging often in Te-Ne loops:

*""ESTJs can also develop a warped or imbalanced use of their auxiliary function, Introverted Sensing (Si). When this happens,* ***they become obsessed with sticking to what they know, rapidly closing off alternate viewpoints and perspectives. They may become deeply upset by change  or they may become focused on seeing impracticalities in others. They may become so tied to their own personal, subjective experience that they discount other people’s experiences or are unwilling to see other perspectives.*** *Healthy Si is very aware of details, facts, sense-impressions, and important memories. It is practical, responsible, and highly attuned to changing patterns. Unhealthy Si feels that everything needs to fall in adherence with one’s own subjective experience of how things have always been.""*

\^ Hence the over-generalization that Chase makes all over in his videos.

Look at this description and you'll realize that his Ne is actually third slot, not first slot as he claims:

2D valued Mobilizing/Child: ""***The individual deeply appreciates people who are full of ideas and imagination and who give them a sense of connectedness to what is happening ""out there in the world,"" even if this information cannot be applied practically at the present momen****t. He is even more grateful for people who provide insightful ideas and unconventional analysis to enhance what he is working on or going through at the present moment.""*

You can see Chase often complimenting and appreciating people who are full of ideas, for example nominating in several occasion his mentor and talking about him.

Chase is often looping between Te and Ne:

*""When an ESTJ is in a Te-Ne loop, they are unable to effectively access their introverted functions, Si and Fi. During these times, they become obsessed with possibilities, but often in a negative light. They may see a million ways things could go wrong and try to “jump in” and fix them as quickly as possible without looking at the facts or taking the time to carefully observe the situation internally. They may have a difficult time prioritizing or reaching their goals and they may take hasty action on strange, intuitive whims without really understanding where their premonitions are coming from. This can be a very stressful stage for them as they feel more and more frustrated by their inability to organize, plan, and decide as effectively as they usually do. It’s important for ESTJs who realize they’re in a Te-Ne loop to get healthy access to Si. Take some time to enjoy some peace and quiet and reflect on an experience you enjoy. Find a favorite activity that you’ve always enjoyed, whether it’s a crossword puzzle or cooking a certain meal, and repeat that process. Give yourself time to “introvert” and do some no-pressure detail-oriented project. Getting Si back into the picture will help you regain composure and get out of a loop.""*

As further proof of him being an ESTJ:

*- He finds Ni irritating (Ni being Vulnerable/Trickster for ESTJs), despising INFJs (the conflictuals of ESTJs) and having problems with INTJs (different methods to get effective results done).*

*- He praises a lot Ti, which in ESTJ is their Observing function, and in particular ISTPs. And the default communication style of ISTP is the best way to communicate with ESTJs.*

*- Love/hate relationship with high Fi users, but in particular xNFP types. It points to Fi Suggestive/Inferior.*

*- He is a more chaotic than usual for ESTJs due to being in Te-Ne loops.*

Some people think that Chase's main enneagram is 3w4, but what they're sensing is the disintegration phase of Chase.

Chase is an unhealthy 6w5.

*""Unhealthy 6w5 become increasingly paranoid and obsessed with maintaining their security, and may go to great lengths to protect their positions. They are extremely needy, and may abuse alcohol or drugs as a way of dealing with anxiety and paranoid delusions, as well as of bolstering their inferioirty feelings. The Five-wing adds elements of cynicism and nihilism to the fearful mentality of the unhealthy Six, resulting in growing isolation, desperation, and a capacity for sociopathic actions. Intense stress will likely lead to outbreaks of rage and extremely destructive behavior accompanied by breaks with reality. Self-sabotaging, self-destructive actions bring about humiliation and punishment to atone for guilt, although the extent and nature of their self-destructiveness will be hidden from others because of their reclusive nature. There may be strong propensity for violence as well as sadomasochistic tendencies in sexual expression. Murder and suicide are both real possibilities.""*

Primary instinct SO (social). Tritype 613, considering that one of his ex mentioned how much Chase tends to avoid conflicts (*main instinct core 1*) and his self esteem is based on achievements (*3 as main heart core*).

Unhealthy 613s disintegrate towards 349... 6 disintegrates to 3: competive and arrogant; 1 disintegrates to 4: moody and irrational \[*like claiming that the sperm becomes the brain, spine and nervous system... Look at the video analysis""What MBTI personality is sperm"" by FlowState lol*\]; 3 disintegrates to 9: disengaged and apathetic.

So the question is... Why he lies about his type?

The whole ENTP charade is how he justifies his unhealthy behaviours and avoids therapy.

Amongst his unhealthy behaviours, I’ll mention that…

* Chase committed identity theft.
* One of his exes went to a therapist after frequenting him due to how much emotional damage he caused to her during their relationship.
* As mentioned by his ex Ande Sloeijk, Chase displayed behaviours that they’re congruent with someone with NPD (*amorous subtype*) or similar in their courtship.
* He persuaded a couple to avoid seeking help for their autistic son. Flowstate made a video analysis on the topic on Youtube. (**CS Joseph's Dangerous Advice | ""Ignore Your Son's Doctors"" | Criticism)**
* Pathological lying.
* A lot of passive-aggressiveness.
* Misleading information about his figure income to trick people into giving him more money. Flowstate made an approximate audit about Chase’s business (“**Cooking the Books: C.S. Joseph's Whopping 6 Figure Income Audited and Analyzed)**

It's highly likely that Chase has personality disorders. Probably ASPD in comorbity with NPD, but to say for sure a proper assessment would be needed.

Don’t donate to him. Don’t buy his services.

You have failed typology Chase Joseph.",1596998913
estp,"So I've been on and off nicotine for 2 or 3 years now.
It seems to me that it just makes life hard. How? Well, I feel like nic lowers Fe and raises Ti so you can observe situations better if you are socially inexperienced. HOWEVER it also seems like it just makes you deal with social situations worse, so its a double edged sword. And for me that other Fe lowering edge hurts a lot. It just seems to make life harder.

estp,"I discovered the mbti not long ago and i took the official test and the results are always deifferent (estp,esfp,entp,enfp) i took a cognitive function test and it is always estp or esfp so i think i’ll just describ myself here (my enneagram type is 7w8)

1.first i’d say that i’m really optimistic and enthusiastic i get happy and excited for the smallest things like hanging out with my friends even thought i do it often and spending time with people energize me i hate being alone.if something bad happen to me i’ll always find a way to make it look brighter no matter how bad it is i can’t stay affected by it more than 2days.

2.i love to play the devil’s advocate and debate,i have to give by opinion abt everything even smallest thing and can debate for hour about a subject no matter if it means a lot to me or if i couldn’t care less about.i also always have something to say to defend myself and never run out of thing to say when i argue abt something and i’m also good to convince people.

3.i’m ambitious and i always think i will find a solution about every problem i have in my life,i can do the dumbest thing and everyone will warn me about the consequencies and i’ll always be like «don’t worry i’ll find a solution i always do ».

4.i’m really empathetic and understand well how people feel,why they feel like that,why they act the way they act or why they did a certaine thing even if i don’t agree with what they did.if i’m in a situation where i have to choose a side i’ll see both side of the conflict,nothing is either black or white to me.i’m kinda scared to hurt people’s feelings and make them feel bad with my words for example if a friend ask me if i like her new shoes i’ll say a positive thing even if it’s not true but sometimes i feel the urge to tell people how i think (it don’t happen often) if their behavior really annoys me for example if it talk to a boy and he’s constantly fishing for compliments i’ll tell him not in a serious way to the point he feel embarrassed but in a way he’ll be aware of what i think abt his behavior.

 5.if i feel happy,angry,excited,frustrated by a thing i will not keep it to myself and tell it to everyone around me but if i feel sad,scared or anxious i’ll not tell to anyone and pretend to not feel that way i have trouble to express my feeling and almost feel a shame to say that i’m sad or scared.

I do this without realizing it and it is automatic. I dont know how to turn it off. Its not debilitating or anything its just a slight inconvenience sometimes. It helps to navigate smooth talking in real life though. I just really dont like a lot of movies or TV that involve human actors going through stress because of this.

estp,"Hi ESTP team, 

30 yo male and always tested ENTJ, although people would say I’m a fun personality who’s quite driven. 

Back story; early 20s finished University with an Honours degree in commerce majoring in marketing and always had an interest in finance/stars as I like to analyse numbers and identify patterns especially in business. Climbed a great New Zealand company ladder (I’m from NZ) that had a great culture for six years and enjoyed going down the sales route especially having a mix of account management/business development and some days being outbound with a company vehicle. I finished with that business 2 years ago as I felt I was becoming pigeon holed and wanted a change of industry. I also worked over in London for 4 months while travelling in national account exec role which I enjoyed the analytics of numbers, making decisions and improving results while engaging with all different types of people. 

I used to have terrible work life balance but in the last 3 years have done a lot of person development and soul searching and found out what truely makes me happy and the vision I have for my life. 

Outside of work I enjoy international travel (dam COVID for a while), playing and watching sports (I keep a variety and learning new ones), eating awesome foods and exploring the outdoors going on adventure! 

When I’m in a rut and not self aware I binge on alcohol and cigarettes. I’ve enjoyed reading books on business, sports and people defying adversity to help mitigate negative thinking along with journaling when I’m feeling off. I’ve never had long lasting relationships as I loved having freedom and being single. 

Moving forward I’ve come up with a long term vision;

Professionally; a career in business and sales ideally moving into Sales Management, entrepreneurship, sales contractor or business owner. 

Personally; have invested in a 12 month self development course with a professional coach to manage my money and understand financial principles so I can have financial freedom. 

Outside of work I still want to enjoy all those interests previously listed. The idea being able to have freedom in all areas of my life and live a personal meaningful life. This is where I get confused typed as ENTJ or ESTP.",1596749678
estp,"Hey there. I am an ENTJ woman with an ESTP friend who lives in a different city from me. He and I haven't hooked up yet, but the tension we have is off the charts, and we have talked about maintaining a long-term, non-exclusive fwb relationship, because we are both wild animals, basically. He has a few long distance fwb relationships, but the concept is new to me. He isn't my usual type of guy and the stereotype of ESTP womanizers has me weary. I prefer for us to be nonexclusive, but I want to sort of be the main fwb girl, and not just a random one, if that makes sense. I am highly competitive and I need to take priority over other chicks, and I need visits and texting with me to be prioritized over the other casual relationships. 

Do you think an ESTP type is likely to be able sustain a long-term (and long-distance) relationship like this without getting bored? Do you think it's possible to maintain a higher priority, or is this type of ESTP more likely to treat every girl as equal, and get bored and move on?

Now I know that this is questions that don't have answers, so why do I keep asking myself this. Why do I keep worrying about the things I don't have control over. It is something I'm passionate about and I'm going to have enough free time for myself. It really is the perfect job for me. 

I'm really stressed about it because I don't know what to do in that circumstances. I don't know if it's an estp thing or a person thing to stress about life. All of this is new ground for me. I don't know how to run a business and all that other stuff, so maybe thats it. I don't know.

When a semi attractive person acts kind of nice to me one time, I romanticize it until I fall in love with the idealized version of them in my own mind and not actually who they are in real life. Then I get to know them more and after I fall ""out of love"", I cringe and I'm like - why did I ever like this person? I must have been insane. And it was because I had fallen in love with the idea of someone they could be that they actually weren't but I was just blinded by my romanticized view of them to see the reality of who they were.

It happens to me so often that for almost all of my past ""crushes"", I'm cringing and thinking to myself - how could I have ever liked this person?

estp,"There’s something about making the most of every day and knowing that it could be your last that really appeals to the Se-Ti pair, whatever order. Of course, that can lend itself to risky behavior that often flouts rules and expectations. But I’d say that the act of making swift decisions is something that really stimulates me, whatever situation. Like Se demands real-time action and stimuli, then Ti decides to make a split-second decision based on said information. I think this is conducive to sports, business, entertainment, etc. and shows a decisive quality that can often be mistaken for Te.

So I’m an avid baseball fan and watch primarily the Nationals. I always appreciated how Bryce Harper (presumably ESTP) played his absolute hardest every single game and seemed to have tons of physical energy day in and day out. Thing is with him is he made a lot of enemies with his often seemingly reckless play, but I’d argue it’s controlled by realizing that he can only make a decision now that makes the most sense and then can gauge new information in real-time in order to make the next decision and not miss a beat. 

But yeah it stems also from how there’s a lack of consideration of future consequences, which really can be a net negative. So really there’s a balance to be struck between taking advantage of opportunities now and trying to plan for what could happen in the future.",1595734576

I wasn’t really all that attracted to him initially. But his persistence and his confidence started having a weird impact on me. I started liking him more and more every time we interacted with each other. 

But he’s really damaged. Has no living parents. Got cheated on by his ex fiancé. And hides his pain behind his pretty big ego. He’s really attentive to me and protective even. And he tries really hard to be consistent. 

But I still struggle to completely give myself to him. Partially because I feel like this has potential to be something really deep and really serious. And I’m not all sure that I’m ready for all that. And partially because I hate to let my guard down and get comfortable only for him to switch up once I least expect it.

ESTP anime characters:

Yusuke Urameshi: This is one of the most stereotypical ESTPs of all time, probably one of the best ones if not the best ESTP of all time in anime and fiction as a whole. Yusuke is ESTP, I've seen people way too often sometimes mistype him hard as ESFP. In my opinion and many others, Yusuke is not ESFP. Not at all, most people see this though and most people see Yusuke as ESTP for sure so I don't have to convince everyone too much.  But yeah, Yusuke is definitely ESTP for sure. He's impulsive, lives in the moment, responds to details in the moment spontaneously, reacts to details in the moment all the time and doesn't care much about the future at all most the time. He sees logical inconsistencies a lot, sees the truth of things and cares about accuracy with his Ti, his Fe makes him care about peoples emotions and be emotional himself, he cares about society values with his Fe and cares what people think too often even if he tries to hide it. His lower Ni comes out with not being future oriented and struggling to see patterns behind the scenes. Despite this weakness he can sometimes see patterns and get hunches about things, when he was talking on the swing he did this a long with moments in the Sensui Chapter Black arc.

Katsuki Bakguo - Bakugo is definitely ESTP, he's not ENTJ, not at all in my opinion. He's impulsive and responds to details in the moment and lives fully in the moment today and is bad at planning for the future and hates thinking about the future most of the time at all costs. He jumps into things more often and tries to spontaneously figure out how to handle a situation on the spot fully in the moment. He sees logical inconsistencies with his Ti and intelligence, noticing the truth or suspecting somethings up or not adding up with his Ti is one of his specialties and he does it all the time very well in tons of situations in the series. Bakugo feels peoples emotions often in situations and cares about society values and public perception and what people think to an insane degree with his Fe, other types can do this too but Bakugo clearly does this to a massive degree with his Fe and caring about public perception of society and it all meaning so much for him and being recognized by other people for everything he does. Bakugo's Fe feeds his ego and makes him feel special inside. His Ni inferior is clear in that he always fails to plan for the future often and struggles to see things behind the scenes usually because he's so hotheaded with his Se and is screaming constantly everywhere without talking or calming down about it, this hotheaded behavior with his Se fits perfectly with exploding quirk. But when he does sometimes he can use his Ni to read between the lines with his Ti as well, he suspects Deku is connected to All Might with both functions and his hunch ends up being right and he even ends up talking with the two of them about it eventually. Here's a Bakugo ESTP post I just made, check it out here if you want more and my full analysis on Bakugo here.

My Bakugo ESTP post:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/hvixkv/katsuki\_bakugo\_estp\_how\_hes\_a\_se\_dom\_and\_tife/](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/hvixkv/katsuki_bakugo_estp_how_hes_a_se_dom_and_tife/)

Hercule Mr. Satan - Ok, this is one of the best ESTPs on this list in my opinion. He's blunt, lives in the moment, impulsive, brash, logical, unemotional, to the point, loud, confident, loves to fool the public, and likes to show off and talk about his toughness to people and the world. Mr. Satan is a hilarious awesome character and very amusing and awesome one at that. He uses his Fe to read peoples emotions and rile them up and control the public perceptions views on him. He cares a lot about society values and what society thinks of him with his Fe. He's very in the moment with his Se and responds to details quickly in most situations, he thinks things through with his Ti analysis and notices when things don't add up with it and tries to find the truth and answers with his Ti aux. Sometimes he can be impulsive and not think about the future at all with his Ni inferior like jumping in the ring to fight Cell and risking his life but despite that he's a very amusing character and very fun to watch. He saved the world in the Buu Saga by allowing his words to reach the people and getting them to put the energy up for the Spirit Bomb. This scene was amazing and Toriyama got to use a gag character for saving the world against mass destruction by Buu by using him and making him useful in a arc. One of the best, always gonna remember him.

Here's a Dragon Ball Z Chart where Hercule Mr. Satan is put down as ESTP as well, check it out when you can because its very accurate compared to most MBTI charts and gets most of the characters right on the chart for sure in my opinion, in general no doubt at least. I agree with everything for their opinion on character typings and think most them a very right and accurate, but I only disagree with strongly with Videl and Android 16. I type Videl ENTJ because she's logical and cares about efficiency and getting things done and staying on task and is bossy in a Te way and assertive and structured, and Videl always reads between the lines and suspects what's going on behind the scenes with his Ni and intuition and decisiveness with the quick conclusions she comes too often that she always try to prove, like when she suspected Gohan was the Gold fighter and wanted to prove his conclusion and Ni hunch right. She also had a hunch Gohan beat Cell and not her dad and she asked him and was right and she had Ni hunch Gohan was alive in the Buu Saga on the lookout and his Ni intuition was right and Gohan actually was alive after, this is why I type Videl ENTJ, she might look ESFJ now in super but trust me Videl is ENTJ from the manga and anime of Dragon Ball Z in my opinion and many others too as well. Android 16 is driven by Si duty to beat and kill Goku at all costs, it goes hand in hand with his android programming and orders and he feels the emotions of others and beings and animals a lot with his Fe, which further humanizes his character and adds personal depth to him as well, that's why I type Android 16 ISFJ for sure in my opinion. Besides that though for those two typings I disagree with and why I think Videl is ENTJ definitely and Android 16 is ISFJ too, I agree with everything else on the Dragon Ball Z MBTI Chart though. So check it out down below if your interested, its a really good chart and very accurate for most of the characters and their personality traits and characteristics:

[https://www.personalityclub.com/blog/which-dragonball-z-character-is-your-personality/](https://www.personalityclub.com/blog/which-dragonball-z-character-is-your-personality/)

Portgas D. Ace - Hotheaded, impulsive, polite, logical, brash, assertive, overall unemotional, confident, and cool. Ace is the perfect example of a ESTP. When he was kid he was cold and unemotional, it took him a long time to warm up to people. He cared about society perception and got angry when people bad mouthed him because of his father he hated. He held this grudge all his life and it defined how he viewed things. He's impulsive as he jumped in out of his rage when Whitebeard told him not to chase Blackbeard for killing Thatch and he didn't listen and went after him pissed and enraged. He tried to kill Whitebeard over and over again despite the failures and impulsive risking his life everytime. He also impulsively went back to fight Akainu because he bad mouthed Whitebeard, he didn't see the future implications of this mistake with his Ni inferior and he payed the price by dying and peolpe get on him for this even today. His Se made him live fully in the moment and impulsively jump into that situations. He sees logical details and inconsistencies a lot and cares about accuracy and hates rules and being controlled by others. Makino developed his Fe and made him care about Fe politeness which carried onto his adulthood and added onto his Fe of caring for society values. Responding to details in the moment is everything to Ace and being hotheaded with his Se and Ti fits perfectly with his power of Fire just like with Bakugo.

Franky - Responds to details in the moment and is very hands on. He even criticizes Usopp for not knowing how to use a hammer correctly since Usopp is ENTP and Franky is ESTP and is more hands on with his Se, this scene fits perfectly with this scene. We see how impulsive Franky is in his flashback by making the Battle Franky's and not thinking about the future at all with his Ni inferior and its negative implications by making them and dangerous weapons anyone could use. Iceberg an ISTJ tells at him for this and his Si dom behavior makes him worry about negative possibilities in the future also with his Ne inferior and he tells Franky anything could happen by making those weapons and other people could use them to hurt and destroy others, its dangerous and you can't take the risk. Franky learns the truth here the hard way and doesn't forget it his whole life. Overall Se is a big part of Franky and it fits his punk street guy kind of attitude and personality he has. He cries a lot with his Fe ter as well which is amusing but despite this Franky is definitely logical and very blunt person. He got to the point and wasn't very emotional when he was blunt with Usopp about the Merry and he told Brook bluntly people would be scared of him if he left once he got his shadow back, so why continue on living and trying to leave this place as a skeleton who would scare people. Overall Franky is that emotion and definitely a logical personality and he loves working with tools with his Se and Ti, ESTP fits Franky best for sure.

Tsunade from Naruto - Tsunade is ESTP definitely in my opinion. She's not ENTJ, not ENFJ, definitely ESTP and Se dom and Ti aux user. She lives in the moment and doesn't focus on the future much unless when necessary as a more mature developed ESTP adult herself, she responds to details in the moment that she sees and pays attention to and reacts to quickly and spontaneously. She's irresponsible and hates work, rules, paperwork and structure and struggles sitting down being Hokage and finds it very boring and mundane and prefers doing things for fun and desires sensory pleasures like gambling and drinking sake, any type can like doing sensory pleasures even Ne users can like physical activity and sensory pleasures like eating or drinking and play games, but Tsundade does it in a Se dom way and values sensory pleasures like a Se dom ESTP and SP as well, she doesn't like sensory like NPs do or other types do as well. Tsunade is very SP and Se dom like with her approach to sensory pleasure and satisfaction, ESTP fits Tsunade best in how she goes about these things and for other reasons I'm mentioning here for why she's a Se dom and ESTP. She's impulsive and hotheaded with her Se and jumps into things and gets angry at people that insult her in a instant when they say something she doesn't like and instantly explodes in the moment with her Se rage and spontaneity. She sees inaccuracy with her Ti and pieces together what doesn't add up with her Ti aux behavior and function. She feels and reads people's emotions a lot and felt strongly with her Fe of the two people that died she loved and moved her Fe love and emotionally suppotiveness to Naruto once she saw he had the same Hokage dreams and acted just like the loved ones she cared about that died as well. She cares about society values and emotional supports people with her Fe when she can which is fairly often for the most part even if she's overly more logical with her Ti more often in situations and more unemotional and logical and assetive overall as a person. Tsunade's balance for Ti and logical and her Fe tertiary emotion and feeling other peoples feelings and supporting them is a nice balance in her character and personality in the show and her Fe tertiary is a good fit for her as a medical ninja too. Fi users can be doctors too in fiction and real life, but Tsunade is definitely a Fe tertiary user and doctor in her case as an ESTP Fe user herself. She struggles to think of the future with her  Ni and impulsiveness and hotheaded Se rage moments toward people, but when she does calm down she can read between the lines with her Ni inferior hunches when necessary as well along with her Ti aux too, but overall Ni is Tsunade's major weakpoint, even if she's a much more mature ESTP female and Hokage, her Ni inferior is somewhat developed and helps her with planning strategies and missions for people and leading others and giving directions and thinking about the future when necessary, despite this again though her Ni is a bit developed as a ESTP mature adult but she still overall struggles with Ni in general as I mentioned with my examples above. Despite this maturity in her and being a pretty good leader she overall hates structure and being winded down working as Hokage and hates doing duties and work and much rather would be having sake and playing slot machines whenever she can in the series.

Figured the ESTP reddit would love this one, so here ya go. Feel free to share your comments down below, I'd love to hear them. Thanks for the support

So I've been meaning to do this one for awhile. So sometimes I think there's bias and sometimes I think there isn't. Some main characters and characters are intuitive and some aren't and are sensors, In my opinion Bakugo is the latter. Like I said in my opinion some characters are intuitive like certain Disney characters, most shonen MCs, and some video game characters too. But this post isn't about them, its about Bakugo. In my opinion, strong opinion Bakugou isn't the exception I said earlier for intuitives actually being intuitive characters, in my opinion Bakugo is definitely a sensor and a Se dom and definitely ESTP, I think calling Bakugou ENTJ is massive intuitive bias and very inaccurate to his character and behavior. I'm actually surprised this is a thing with him but that's my opinion. Now I'm gonna to share my opinion and reasoning in short on why I type him ESTP, I'll have a longer post for him in the future so instead this post will be brief compared to my longer character posts from the past. But still I'll put effort in this post based on what I know from Bakugo from the series based on watching through the years.

Bakugo is an Se dom and ESTP. He lives in the moment and jumps into things without thinking about the future at all and is very bad a planning and is very impulsive too. Se and Ne users both jump into things impulsively without planning often but Se users do it moreso with living in the moment completely, it's what there known for moreso. Bakugo impulsively jumps into everything and figures things out as he goes spontaneous, he reacts to details in the moment and focuses on what's happening today right now. He's good paying attention to a lot of details around him and is very aware of all details in the moment that he's able to respond to and react too at a moments notice. Bakugo's 5 senses are everything to him and go hand and hand perflectly with his exploding bomb quirk, Se fits perfectly with this power and matches his Se dom behavior and hotheadedness very well. He's a very energetic person and is impatient with his Se not Te in his case, both of them are impatient functions but for different reasons, Bakugo is just impatience becauase of his adrenaline and wants to handle details in the moment quickly and move onto react to the next thing with his Se. He struggles with efficiency and staying on task showing low Te and is not organized and is very bad at planning or thinking about the future, to be ENTJ you need to be good at all these traits and Bakugo doesn't and is bad at everyone of them. 

He's extremely impulsive and hates structure and planning for the future completely and prefers to live in the moment and respond to details spontaneously, which shows Bakugo is ESTP over ENTJ clearly. Bakugo notices logical details and inconsistencies with his Ti aux and a lot his intelligence especially in tough situations come from this function, he can spot what's going on and what's not adding up and always is looking for the truth and accuracy in situations. Bakugo reads people's emotions and emotional state and is very sensitive to what others are feeling all the time, he cares about society values and puts a lot of weight on other people's opinions. We see this in his flashback with Deku and leading kids and feeling good about himself being respected and love while doing it and being popular in a very Fe appreciated style way not Fi loving popular way if you see the difference. Public recognition, social harmony, and societal values mean a ton to Bakugo and his obsessions for what other people think and feel about him with his Fe is so strong its to the point of being superficial at times. He doesn't really care about inner values but instead cares about the values of others and what society thinks on things and about him showing his Fe tertiary in him, public opinion is everything to Bakugo and further feeds his ego and pride for things. The general publics opinion of him and him being appreciated by people and acknowledging by others is one of the most Fe things ever in Bakugo and he just can't turn it off and can't stop feeling other people's emotions on things and again can't stop caring about them and what they think of him to a huge degree, Bakugo is definitely a Fe user. Bakugo struggles with Ni and planning for the future, he hops into things with his Se and lives fully in the moment. Respond to details in the moment with his Se is again everything to him a long with Fe public perception of him, he puts a lot of precedence on responding and paying attention to details in the moment and as a result doesn't care about planning at all or reading between lines behind the scenes. This is a major weakness in Bakugo, Ni is not his strong suit at all and with struggling with seeing patterns behind the scenes unlike an Ni dom like Deku for INFJ. Bakugo struggles with Ni all the time but sometimes he does use it when necessary. He uses his Ni inferior in tandem with his Ti to look for things behind the scenes and what's not adding up to him, sometimes he gets hunches about things and sees a few possibilities and is decisive quickly about certain things even though he's a perceiver and Se user. He has focused and narrow Ni hunches sometimes when necessary and focuses on them when the time comes like with suspecting Deku is connected to All Might and so on. Overall Ni is a struggle for him but he again sometimes uses it when he can.

I’ve long since realized she has narcissistic tendencies and emotional immaturity, and it’s so hard to deal with her when she’s such a master manipulator. My parents are the only 2 people in my life that can really get to me and being home with her complex emotions and selfish tendencies is super tough.

1. Urgent/Important: These are tasks that you need to DO
2. Not Urgent/Important: These generally are aligned with longer-term objective and you should SCHEDULE them
3. Urgent/Not Important: This tends to be busy work that doesn’t necessarily align with your goals. Try to DELEGATE or AUTOMATE these, if possible.
4. Not Urgent/ Not Important: These don’t add truly add value. Think browsing social media. Try DELETE them from you To-do list.

estp,"I want to bring attention to something important I've experienced personally, especially since I believe other people here may also have struggled with distinguishing this. 

It's been common for many ESTPs to wonder whether they are actually ENTPs, and I totally get why. At the surface, both types initially look pretty similar. 

**Some traits ExTP's share:** spontaneous, thrill-seeking / risk-taking, easily bored, enthusiastic, conversational, hesitant to commit to a singular option / possibility, aversion to rules / structure, procrastination, unconventional 

Now, whenever I look more into the differences between these two types, unfortunately I come across vague and stereotypical statements. A few of the ones that I think are particularly misleading are: 

&amp;#x200B;

""ESTPs are fine with small talk and don't enjoy ruminating on deep, theoretical conversations / debating, unlike ENTPs"" 

""ESTPs ruminate less on novel ideas / concepts compared to ENTPs, and are less willing to explore various possibilities""

""ESTPs don't really care about learning / exploring random things that don't have a direct applicability to their life, unlike ENTPs"" 

&amp;#x200B;

A lot of these statements come from the pro-intuitive bias in the MBTI community. In fact, most personality tests are more likely to type people as intuitive when they are really sensors due to this. If you got into MBTI initially because of [16personalities.com](https://16personalities.com), and you / any friends who took the test got something like ""55% intuitive"" once, guess what - they're probably actually a sensor.  

That being said, I have a close ENTP friend and I've closely observed more realistic differences that seem to differ us from ENTPs. Here are a few: 

&amp;#x200B;

**1.** When hanging out with other people, I definitely enjoy long, deep conversations and occasional debates. However, just indefinitely talking (especially while sitting down) does not appeal as much to me compared to if we actually went out while talking and did something to make a more vivid memory, like going hiking, going to the bar, etc. The same cannot be necessarily said for ENTPs. 

(I think this is where the idea of ESTPs being more prone to ""physical stimulation"" and ENTPs being more prone to ""mental stimulation"" comes from)

**2.** Let's say an idea is proposed, like an entrepreneurial idea. What will excite me is more about what could be done to turn the idea into reality. How could I capitalize on this and take advantage of opportunities that come my way? How can I turn this into something practical and make a profit? I'm excited to take action. The ENTP type is likely more prone to continue ruminating and envisioning all the future possibilities stemming from that idea - telling them to actually buckle down and do something tangible with the idea may ruin things for them, while we're more likely to ""dive in headfirst"". 

(I think this is what people mean when vaguely claiming that ESTPs are ""more realistic"") 

**3.** Let's say you're in the debate team and given a hypothetical scenario, and told to brainstorm all the varying possibilities relating to that scenario before arguing about it against the opposing team. ESTPs may tend to be more methodical in their process, rationally stating points from the possibilities they observed and actively working towards closure. Most importantly, their main stimulation will come from the competitive nature of the debate itself against the opposing team. On the other hand, ENTPs may be more hypothetical, more interested in uncovering as many possibilities as possible rather than formulating a more structured argument and working towards a resolution. Their main stimulation will come from the brainstorming process itself. 

(I think this is where the idea of ENTPs being the prime debaters / brainstormers comes from)

But when my brother heard, he said it was just “attention seeking” and a “bad attitude”. I almost turned around and punched him right then and there. He does not understand that it’s a serious issue that I myself have dealt with. When I was their ages, I said the same exact thing for this or that reason. I cannot handle that my nieces’ mental healths are being ignored and downgraded.

estp,"hey, any ESTPs here who also can identify as a HSP as well?

i'm not sure if this is more of a feminine trait to have, but i'd be interested if it's any common among us. i'm a gal who's both of them, yet my ESTP-ness kinda seems to block some of the HSP traits - i.e low social energy, easily overwhelmed by sensory things etc. - unless i'm extremely anxious/unhealthy. 

i always found it a bit weird that as an ESTP, i'm socially so aware and more hesitant than in any other area of my life (and more compared to other ESTPs that i've met), even after not having much of my past social anxiety left. i don't feel anxious anymore in the same situations, but i'm still super slow to act as i can kinda sense ""everything"" i see in others. i can be seen as the kind of ""confident shy girl"" until i get to know people better. i spend a lot of time in my head, even if it doesn't work as well as just giving into my Se fully - and even when i'm exercising/doing fully physical stuff, my head is still spinning with everything in and around me. i also get emotionally hurt more easily than i've seen other ESTPs do and while i get over it as fast, i can just call myself someone who's super sensitive - whether or not i show any of it outwardly or not.

anyways, enough about me - do you relate yourself or know someone who's a HSP and also one of the MBTI types that aren't known to being ""sensitive &amp; shy""?

estp,"I’ve had a hard time learning new things. Concepts often seem to go over my head and I rarely ever recall what I thought I learnt. Over time, I realized that it was because I never truly understood what I was learning.

The Feynman technique is particularly effective at helping you master difficult concepts. Named after the Nobel Prize winning Richard Feynman, the concept focuses on explaining a difficult concept in easy to understand language as if you were explaining it to someone else (or a child). By following the Feynman technique, you might just end up learning difficult concepts quickly, spend less time studying, and remember concepts longer.

The four steps are as follows:

1. Write the concept down
2. Explain it using simple language
3. Address (look up) problematic areas or questions that remain
4. Challenge yourself to simplify it further

I have found this to be a powerful concept that helps you cut study time shortly. The push to understand and explain a concept forces you to identify areas where you have a gap in your understanding. I’ve broken this down even further here - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RleSyp16lLE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RleSyp16lLE).

estp,"One of my best friends of almost 15 years is an ESTP. My favorite thing about him is it’s all support and no drama. We can say whatever we want and not worry about judgement. Here’s some of the things that I appreciate about him - 

He’s someone who has that quality of ‘someone you love to hate’ and likes playing the role of the villain in my friend group. The reason I like that is I’m a person who avoids conflict with everyone so it’s a good dynamic between us. 

He encourages me when I’m reluctant to give my opinion on something. He’s like a hype man that can get me feeling confident better than anyone else. 

He is a voice of reason when I want to do something risky but he also thinks it’s funny and tells me to do whatever I want. I think because he knows by telling me I shouldn’t do something makes me want to do it more. 

We can not talk to each other for weeks and nothing changes. But he gets me to hang out more than I would without him. 

He is someone that if I ever got into a fight, he would be the first one by my side ready to start throwing punches.

estp,"Hi!

Personabilities has created a new personality test called Intellabilities. It measures not the level but the range of your intelligence. It's kind of like a cross between MBTI and StrengthsFinder. The test takes 10-15 minutes to take and afterwards you'll get a 40 page report on your intelligence abilities and personality. It will show you what specific abilities you have, what fields of study you should pursue (as in specific college majors), and what careers would be best for you.

We're curious if there's a correlation between being an ESTP and Intellabilities types.

I’m an awkward 25 y/o INTP male. Struggled with girls my whole life. 

I matched with a girl on tinder and we immediately hit it off. She even seems way more into me than I am to her. She constantly called me cute, told me I had nice abs, nice ass etc. 

We had multiple sexual conversations, almost all of which she initiated. I could text her something causal and she would turn it into sexting. She would tell me she thought about me while fucking her ex and couldn’t wait to fuck me.

We actually got along really well too, she took the test and came out ISTP. We had a lot in common and genuinely enjoyed talking to her. She would get weirdly emotional about her ex sometimes though.

I ask her to hang out and she says she wants me to get tested first because she doesn’t know where I’ve been. So I get an STD check. We continue flirting as usual.

Last week I ask her to hang out and she says she can’t because she has face peeling from getting a facial. I tell her I’m not looking for a pen pal and want to know when she’s free. She says “2 weeks from now but I’m not sure because I haven’t gotten my work schedule yet” she continues to try to flirt with me as usual

estp,"ENFP here ... I have two close ESTP friends and sometimes really get confused about their way of “feeling” and dealing with problems from the past or childhood. I myself have a strong Fi and can spend hours on self reflection and on feeling and understanding my emotions. You ESTPs have this Fe thing going on, which sometimes makes me think you never actually take some “me time” off to self reflect. When I ask my ESTP friends about their childhood problems, I just get responses like “ah, yeah, my mom was a bitch. But thats not MY business. I don’t care. It’s how it is.”
This really confuses me. When I, as an ENFP, talk about my childhood problems, it would be like “it was hard. It still is hard. I notice how it affects me in my everyday life. Sometimes I am not sure about the vibes between my mother an me [... and so on]”

Obviously, the ESTP response makes me assume, you have “no feelings”. Or you just “give a f***” about feelings.

Anyway when he was very little, he lit up my life with his clownish antics and amazing ability to turn the worst of my moods into laughter. He’s adorable, and so funny, and everyone loves him.

But within the past year or so I’ve been struggling with some real anger toward him. (Side note: when I’m angry with my children it’s almost always because they’re doing something potentially dangerous.) The ESTP endangers himself and others like it’s his fucking job. 

You can not tell him anything, ANYTHING, that he will accept as fact without “testing it” first. And yes, I get that Ti users like to “think for themselves” and all that nonsense but honestly who is really the smart one when I tell my children to stay away from fireworks and the ISFP child listens to me, while the ESTP has to sneak away from his uncle and blow one up himself, burning his hands, just to reach the same conclusion that I ALREADY TOLD HIM: IT IS DANGEROUS?!

I am so upset. I cried myself to sleep last night. He was with an ENTP adult and an ISTP adult and lied and told them “it didn’t even hurt that bad” and continued to play with Sparklers even though his hands were burned. The only time he acted even remotely upset is when I confronted him about it, as soon as I found out. And even then I 100% think he only cried because *I was crying*. I do not know if he felt guilty for upsetting me, or was trying to manipulate me into not feeling sorry for him so I wouldn’t be so angry.

Basically I feel like this kid responds to NOTHING except occasionally, guilt over what he puts me through. But I grew up with an ENFJ mother who used to guilt-trip me constantly and I refuse to be that person. I worry constantly, and I can see how his future can turn out, and it scares me.

On top of everything else, my youngest child seems to be just like him. She reminds me of him in every way, and I’m almost certain she’ll wind up being ESTP as well. Everything is compounded then, I worry about his influence on his younger siblings (he’s constantly misbehaving and doing dangerous things in front of them), and 2x the ESTP shenanigans...also he fights with the ISFP constantly...

Because of the lockdown (I do not like the Q word)  and something kinda personal happen. It may have changed me as a person and I became a different person. I don’t really feel like an ESTP anymore. I dunno if it’s a grip or a loop or did I actually change but this isn’t normal for me.

Its hard to describe but I don’t really feel like an ESTP anymore. And people have been talking to me and saying things about me completely the opposite of an ESTP. Before the personal event happened I had a lot of Se. Now it doesn’t feel that way. I was also the happiest in my life before all this.

Also it’s because unlike the other ESTPs I don’t really like to do sports and stuff. The lockdown is draining me a lot and I am losing motivation to work out, which is the most I can do. I wanted to work out more this year I went to the gym as much as I could but when they closed I didn’t wanna work out anymore? Its weird. I’m an extrovert , I get more energy from being around people, but I don’t want to be around people. I want to be alone, because I am used to it?

Also people at my school call me things that I don’t feel I am. It makes me angry. Its hard to describe why. But today something happened and it’s the final straw for me to completely feel unsure of myself. Before all of this I was very ESTP: smart, bubbly, logical, fun-loving, super extrovert, kind, bold. Now I don’t feel like any of these. I actually don’t really see myself in ANY function.

Some of the things I was always good at, I thought I was good at, people criticize me and say I’m bad at them. And I also mess up on them myself. All this year. 2020. (And a lil bit 2019)

\- I consider people weak bitches if they let their emotions guide their decisions. 

\- I refuse to listen to rules because I'm the one who's in charge and nobody can tell me what to do. I've gotten into arguments with plenty of authority figures and someone has called the police on me before. I've also stolen from a store.

\- My planning skills are on point. I know exactly how to climb the ladder to become the boss woman CEO I'm gonna be one day. I've planned out my entire college roadmap with the easiest classes and already planned out my career path, step by step. I also have an excel document with all my expenses listed.

\- I have grandiose fantasies about the future and enjoy seeing people bow down to the ground I walk on.

\- I love trolling and roasting friends.

\- I'm always correct about everything. Others have accused me of being wrong or drawing conclusions about things, but they just don't want to acknowledge that I'm correct.

\- I love seeking revenge. I recently made a catfish to play a guy's feelings because he dared to try to mess with me. I love seeing others in pain.

\- People find me hilarious because of my savage humor, but I'm actually just a bitch disguising it as a joke.

\- My ideal lifestyle would to be so rich that I don't need to work at all. I'd spend all my time eating food, doing aggressive dances, taking selfies, and starting drama.

\- I'm impatient and always rushing because I don't have any time to waste. I also have been diagnosed with anger problems.",1593317520

estp,"This is about me, tried posting on the mbti subreddit but they didn't help at all. 

I for the few years I've been in mbti always thought I was a definite ESTP, but recently not so sure. Some quick facts that could help:

1. Been told I wear my heart on my sleeve, but that's for emotions like happiness, excitement, anger, and frustration. If stressed or sad or going through a funk I withdraw and don't talk about my feelings at all, though my body language and face gives away how frustrated I am, I cannot hide how I feel

2. I don't know how to talk about how I'm feeling on the inside if probed to talk. Someone from my family tried to have a talk with me about my frustrations and internal feelings today, and no joke it took a hour for me to have fully expressed what I was feeling. I couldn't look them in the eye when talking about how depressed I was feeling, and I couldn't talk about it in full sentences, I had to stop a few times to fully get it off my chest

3. Not sure if this will help, but when really stressed out and pushed to my limit I think of worst case scenarios and am scared to do anything. I wouldn't be able to drive without worrying about being in a accident or fucking up my car. Even going to the drive thru, I'll worry about how the person is gonna talk to me and if its gonna be potential conflict and arguing. I can't even go online on my Xbox to talk shit as I will think about what the other people will feel and say to me for talking, when normally I wouldn't give a flying shit. One time when really stressed out I even panicked about honking at someone because I immediately began to think about the possibility of the driver being a crazy guy that would come out and try to shoot me or pull my out my window. It gets very bad and unrealistic yet I treat it as truth

I don't know if I have Fe or Fi. I think my last point shows inferior Ni though. Thoughts?",1592943253

So, one of my oldest friends is an ESTP.

One of my favorite people, seriously. But anyway, she thinks mbti is completely ridiculous, and I was wondering, beyond the surface, do you think mbti is a useful and valid tool, or is it just kinda fun? I know INTJs are some of the most invested in mbti types.

Also, could you give me some insight on how ESTPs analyze people? What do you notice about people first? Do you consider yourself to be good at reading people?

A quarter-life crisis is far more common that you’d think. Almost 75% of 25-33 year olds go through tons of stress and anxiety about understanding who they really are. I kinda feel like I’m still working my way through it too. There is pressure to figure out what you want out of life and fear that anything you’re working towards will not work out.

As I’ve navigated this for myself, I’ve discovered that having perspective, and doing some introspection into what fulfills me has allowed me to channel my energy in the right places.

estp,"Do ESTPs test people to prove they care about or are interested in them? Especially to those close to them or those that they'd like to be close to? A bit of backstory...

I (INFJ male) have this friend (ESTP female), we've known each other for about a decade now and have gotten along pretty well throughout that time. She's certainly not shy about flirting with me in a physical way at times, but her Se is through the roof and mine sucks ass so I dunno if that's any different from how she normally acts with people. The entire time we've known each other at least one of us has been in a relationship with someone else and she's now married, so we've just been friends.

In the last couple years she frequently started flaking out on plans she'd make at the last minute. Usually this would be something along the lines of her making plans with a group of our friends, cancelling a few hours beforehand, then later making new plans with a smaller group or with just her and I. She'd often tell me something along the lines of ""I figured you'd understand"", but all I could really tell is that she would seem nervous and uneasy (normally she's very confident and high energy) and didn't seem like she was comfortable with me pressing for anymore info than that. After a bit of time she'd bounce back to normal and all was fine.

But more and more I feel like she's been doing this as a means of testing me in some way. Like a few months ago she texted to ask if I'd help her out with her car. I said that I would but didn't hear back from her for a while, then she texted back saying thanks but her sister was going to help instead. Recently, she asked if I wanted to grab a drink with her at a specific day and time. I said sure, but I had something I was doing so it had to be 15 minutes later than when she wanted to meet. She lamented about their not being enough time then, so I agreed to drop what I was doing earlier to meet her at that specific time. All seemed well until a couple hours before when she cancelled stating only ""something came up"".  I just said sorry to hear that, but let me know if you want to meet up some other time and I'd be happy to do so. Surprisingly, I heard nothing back from her after that. But later I saw that she had been posting a lot on social media the day before we were supposed to meet, and also a lot a few hours before and after as well. I feel like she wanted me to respond to her social media posts beforehand to indicate my continued interest in meeting up (or that she wanted me to do so after the fact to indicate my interest), but that I ""failed the test"" because I don't log into social media all that often and didn't see things until later.

It's funny because the subtle testing of others is something I used to do when I was less mature and too scared to approach someone directly. So I'm not mad, just hoping she's not turning into the younger version of me. Again, normally she's very confident and seemingly not afraid at all to approach people so this is pretty unlike her. But I'm left wondering if I should talk to her about it, or just let it go so she can sort things out by herself? Would you guys want to be approached about this, if so, how?",1592624784
estp,"So I have this friend who says he’s an ESTP, I don’t have a conclusion on his type yet.

He said he was free, but no he is saying he can’t meet in the morning because he, “will wake up at 7:00. Have breakfast at 9:00am. Will be baking at 10:00 and so I cannot meet in the morning” Which doesn’t sound SP to me.More like SJ or just any J.

&amp;#x200B;

**MODES**

&amp;#x200B;

Basically a chad 100% of the time.

In reality, I am really different. I get invested in some peoples'  hardships and feel deeply. I'm really invested in social justice, especially for oppressed populations. I keep a journal to decompress the day. I make sure everyone who I love is doing ok. I try my best to be kind to every single person I meet. And these things really matter to me. 

I know most people would say that's simply being human, but given the ESTP stereotype, I don't know if I'm mistyped or if I just have a highly developed Fe. I know I'm a really healthy ESTP and I don't shy away from the emotional work most ESTPs avoid.

Dropped out of pharmacy school to go into health administration, then corporate finance, then into management consulting where I am now. It’s my 3rd year as a consultant after switching 2 firms (for a raise and title bump) and already know this isn’t for me long term. Barely able to meet expectations because I have to really keep myself in check to be accountable for deliverables, deadlines and analysis (all things that I’m naturally wanting to avoid). Can never see myself as a manager ever, so I have no desire to climb the ladder in my firm. But can’t be a consultant forever since most leave after a few more years if there’s no progression. 

What I do enjoy? The exciting travel (which Covid19 has ruined my year) and being able to work on fun teams and interact with clients. Wearing nice suits because I’m a show off like you all. Just being out and enjoying new experiences.

Edit: So far seeing a pattern, I've seen Si types really get into ASMR so it is interesting to see how Se types compare.",1591759911

estp,"I feel like if life is a story, ESTPs are the villains.(and not for lack of good reason)

On the subject of empathy and compassion; I think almost all ESTPs can use their “observation” trait to empathize with someone. But for me and other ESTPs I’ve met, it’s like we have to be actively working to “care” about what we do with that empathy.

Also extraverted-ness and the ability to read people makes ESTPs out as people who like to(although they usually don’t) actively meet and interact with people and manipulate. And even if they don’t care to or like to manipulate, they know full well they have a bunch of cards up their sleeves to hurt someone deeply psychologically and personally only 20 minutes after meeting them.

All people can be assholes but I just think of ESTPs as some of the the most capable asshole. Be it that they are nearly top in likely psychopaths or they look at everyone as almost a “science experiment”, they just don’t seem fit for a character that someone(if they were inside their mind) could feel very safe in connecting with.

I say this from a point of understanding(as an ESTP), not criticism. It just freaks me out how a lot of the very “heroic” and “good” ESTPs constantly know they got ammo to really mess someone up mentally without a large emotional response on their part afterward, especially if their victim had trusted them.

Idk, am I overthinking things or what. I took the test 6 times and 5/6 I came out ESTP. The other time I came out ENTP.",1591676428

estp,"When quarantine started (in mid March for me), I was not excited to be home alone for a long time. As time went on, I finally felt as if it was normal to be alone this long. Now I realize that it isn't normal; something is different about me (mentally and emotionally). 

I realize that I'm creating useless (usually political) arguments with family members and friends. I am also placing more stress on my future than I used to. I feel upset almost all of the time now. I notice that I am more stubborn than I once was. Even with my best friend, I feel as though I am creating a distance between us with my petty arguments. 

Especially with social distancing, I feel as though my friends and family all have different views of it. (Only child with a single parent) My mom is very adamant about social distancing, while my aunts, uncles, cousins, and friends are all going out of the house(without protective gear) undermining suggested guidelines for our state. I find this reckless, and do not respect their decisions to do this at all. These are the people I am closest to, so not agreeing with them on this matter makes me feel.. distant. 

Do any other people feel like this right now? How are you figuring things out? Any help would be appreciated.",1591496808

Just remember to take care of yourself ok? It's not healthy to just work all the time you will break down sooner or later and you don't want that and I don't want that ok? Relax for a while and watch the sun go by and let your mind rest. Go walk in nature and listen to bird's singing and all that good stuff. Have fun with your family and friends and play something together it's really fun (especially when you beat your siblings. Don't just stay the whole day watching youtube videos (you know what I mean). 

And when you feel like you are ready to continue on your goal go for it.

estp,"My buddy is an ESTP, I'm an ENTP. He has taken me under his wing since divorcing my ex. I have no resources but I would still like to show appreciation in a manner that won't make him feel weird but will convey that I have a profound appreciation for his friendship.  


Any advice?",1591486741
estp,"I'm an INTJ female, 17 years old.

I have always been a very reserved person, my feelings are my own and nobody really knows me. Nobody knows my fears, my weaknesses, my dreams... And it's not a lack of self-confidence as many people keep telling me, it's just who I am, I don't like to flaunt my life.

Two years ago, I met an ESTP boy, very toxic, I was 15 years old and we were in middle school together. 

When I first met him, he was very talkative and tactile, which I hate, especially when I don't know people. So I quickly take down a peg or two. From the first day I didn't like him and I didn't want anything to do with him. 

But fate decided otherwise, we were side by side in most of the classes. That bothered me a lot during the first few weeks. We were completely opposite, he was talking, trying physical approaches, touching my hair, it was unbearable for me who doesn't really like to talk in class (except if it's about physics) and who hates to be touched.

Over time, I developed feelings of love for him, even today I can't explain why since he is everything I hate the most. But I fell under his spell, and step by step, I enjoyed it when he talked to me, complimented me and hugged me (with some reluctance for hugs anyway). 

And after 5/6 months, I had an incredible confidence in him, I was convinced that he would keep everything I would say to him, but I was incredibly wrong. I revealed myself to him one night when I was extremely tired and I told him that I liked him, some things that I have experienced and that nobody knows about me...

I had the pleasure of learning that he liked me too, but in the end, he just played with my feelings. It took me two weeks of ""relationship"" to realize it, he was so toxic. 

Everything I said to him that night was read 
by over 10 people, alluding to some of my stories while I was in class. During those two weeks of relationships, he became mean. 
Knowing my weaknesses, he used it to hurt me and even if I didn't show it to him, it got to me. I decided to end it all when I got out of the situation I was in after two weeks.

I found out later that I was the subject of a bet. To go out with that cold-hearted girl and destroy her. He succeeded. Took me about a year and a half to rebuild myself mentally.

And to this day, I still sometimes think back and think I was so naive to reveal myself like that. But then I remember that I didn't know love and that you have to make mistakes to succeed. 

Today, even more than before this story, I keep everything to myself, absolutely everything. And I've never told this story to anyone.

I still see this boy, we are in the same high school and I know that I will surely find myself in his class next year, and surely again at his side.

Dear ESTPs, I would like to know how your work, how ESTPs toxic people act, if he is really an ESTPs and what are your weaknesses, so that I can defend myself if he ever decides to do it again.

PS: Writing this text was one of the hardest things I could do. I don't even know if it is a good idea .

estp,"Don't know which one I am.

With my very close friends and with people I don't mind being weird in front of them I am very talkative , humor, funny, energetic and can like flip everything over.......

I can easily form very good relationship with my teachers and people who are older than me generally, I can make someone whoever he is talk about his inner feelings or what thinks about even if he didn't want to  😅, but for me I don't want any one to know anything personal about me and most of the time I might say bust things if I were asked. Has the potential to be a great manipulator.  I can easily talk to people in private conversations and convince them  but it is very hard for me to stand in front of crowd and say something.


With my family, with people I don't like and most of the time in my training , I am very quiet barely talks , and very mysterious for some people.....


I don't find celebrations are good fit for me wether it is for me or for one of my friends. I just don't like it.  But I like to congratulate or celebrate someone on my own private way.

estp,"Ok I have a very close friend who is an ESTP and we get along great, but have different opinions on many things especially politics. And I've noticed that he has a habit of reading things into things I say (and other people as well) that just aren't there. I'll make a statement and he replies ""are you seriously suggesting ..."" and it's always something completely different from what I said, that I wasn't implying and don't necessarily think. 

For example, I commented that the national guard was shooting at people on their porches with rubber bullets in Minneapolis and that's wrong, that the curfew didn't say people had to be inside their homes, they just couldn't leave their property and they were just standing on their porch. And he said ""Are you seriously saying the national guard is racist?"" ...I didn't say a thing about race and as far as I could tell in the video of this happening the people who got shot at were white, so there would be no reason for me to imply such a thing. 

This is just one recent example that I recall specifically, but it's happened many times about many different topics and it's never what I'm suggesting. I'm usually not ""suggesting"" anything, I'm just making a straightforward statement with nothing implied. Same when I've seen him say it to other people.

she's has no empathy 

I was praised for having good hair (white ppl hair) and for being skinny during childhood. we r both ugly tho..

we're now 19 (me) and 22, and no matter how much I tell her she's prettier than me despite both of us still being witch like AF, she still never misses her chance to put me down when I wear something pretty. ""U look like a bubblehead""...."" Ur legs are fat"" ....""u look....nevermind, I dont wanna hurt u""

i used to stand up for her against everyone. never called her fat. I always said she has a nicer face than me

She always trash talks my appearance and Ne awkwardness. Like bullying me and making me feel totally worthless

one day I flipped and called her fat in an argument. It got even worse

Even on a day where I got caught trying to commit suicide because of my looks, she called me just to get me to admit that im the bad one on loud speaker in front of my mentally ill abusive dad, she even told me I am ugly. Then she pretended to cry at the end. Also, she was trying to get me to admit I don't believe in god when I kinda do

We have very different values (she wants a husband, a house, a job, and kids) and I want to have fun and take risks while I chase adventure. 

I don’t always tell her what’s happening in my life coz I feel like she’ll judge me. I’m currently seeing a really nice guy but he’s not my usual corporate type. He’s got tigers lol and he’s going to teach me how to shoot with real guns. He’s a genuinely good guy and he works hard and gets $$$ but she’ll for sure look down on him. 

I remember she met my friend a few years ago. My friend was in her mid 30s and was still single and partying and she was like “OMG i would be so upset if I was living that life at her age”. Now I have no problem with that coz I knew then that I’d be living that life but I don’t think I’d have even thought about it. 

She’s a good friend but sometimes I feel like the only reason we’re friends is because of history.

I really care about her of course and I’ll never abandon her. 

I just felt like if anyone was going to understand why having a friend who was boring is hard, it’s you guys.",1591200601
