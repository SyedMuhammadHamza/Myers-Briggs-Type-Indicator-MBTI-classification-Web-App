ESTJ,"Frankly if people could express themselves ""self centeredly"" maybe we could stop a bit to beat ourselves over perceived failures and dysfunctionnement when they are normal and part of human experiences.
So thank you, because I too lately feel very low mood and thought I was the only one.

I'm speaking from my pov (I type as INFP or at least xxFP). I was abused as a child till young adulthood and it left mental and physical pains. What you noticed at school is something I saw too, I think sadly in school it can attract unhealthy people who use position if power to feel better.

Your body is catching up with you about everything you gone through. Stress is enought to cause inflammation in the body and triggers pain. The chemical imbalance in the brain caused by stressful events is well documented. Add the fact you had (have?) a poor diet during intense periods and you got enought factors for now health problems.

Maybe you could start listing what is going well for you (or more simply a list of what make you go happy ‚ò∫Ô∏è) and focus on adding more of it. For example me it's taking pictures of flowers, eating chocolate, playing some games, etc

Then listing what make you feel sad/low/üòû and reduce it. For me it's reducing my exchanges with family members because despite their ""intents"" they ends up being harmful to my well-being.

Another point, it's normal to feel you are more motivated to do things for others, opposed to doing it for yourself. It's hard after years of ignoring your needs to be suddenly attuned to it healthily. 

Just try, despite the low or no reward to still stick to some healthy eating and sleeping habit. Pick one, for example ""I eat one healthy meal per day"" and stick to it. 

I myself try to do that and it helps.

Take care!",1617359519
ESTJ,"Hello, I will briefly talk about my story to tell you that you are not the only one. I was also an ESTJ who was depressed. We have similar stories with you. I was also sexually abused. My father's kidney failure and his constant visits to the doctor outside the city made me feel upset and helpless. I became an A+ student even though I had difficulty learning because of my dyslexia. -I am still working on my work order and writing these to you by stretching my break period- I was diagnosed with major depression 2 years ago. I wanted to commit suicide -but I didn't, I was just scared lol- I got a very good result in the national exam, where I studied hard for a year. At the school where I entered the 4th place, I felt like I was empty and did not work and fell to the last place. It took about 1 year. Then I made up my mind and removed the things that made me uncomfortable. I don't have a religion right now. I don't believe in god. I started to reschedule everything. I created a program where I studied for 8-15 hours and I'm starting to feel good again. My ENTP friend helped me through this process, even an ordinary chat with her made me feel very good. Then I began not to attribute my living to a divine cause or any other purpose. I live just because I want to live. The advice I can give you is to give up ISTP completely. It's okay to notice the things that will be good for you, and add things that are good for you to your schedule. This is maybe a human, maybe an activity you enjoy. Just try to listen to yourself more and not suppress your Fi. Fi grip allows us to engage ourselves more and lower our self-awareness.  Happiness is more effective than medications in overcoming depression. You have to discover things that will make you really happy. There may not be many opportunities to meet new people due to the global pandemic. Yes. Maybe you should start talking to your old friends again. Maybe even adopting a pet can be good. You just have to get to know yourself and try to remove or heal anything that bothers you from your life. Without realizing it, minor troubles can make us feel uncomfortable as a major problem. Take care of yourself. You're not alone I understand you. Bad situation but I believe you will overcome ESTJ. Now I'm back to work. Ll see üíñ",1617355457

ESTJ,"Thank you! I tried üòÖ 

And it definitely is interesting! To see all our differences, I think, is to see new possibilities to grow and learn about each other.

ESTJ,"Sorry about the giant block! I'll keep paragraphing in mind üòÖ

In regards to my mom's type, she's definitely ESTJ, I know a lot of Fe users and she just has no Fe. And she's also said that she doesn't really think about feeling in general, and tries not to think about her bad feelings, by throwing herself into work (which is a classic Fi inferior).

In case you need more proof, my aunt is an ESFJ who is a relentless care taker and seeks Fi users like myself to comfort and care for, whereas my mom tends to assume a provider role rather than caretaker. She also definitely does not have thinking as an inferior function like ESFJs do. My mom is a very obvious Te hero, very matter of fact and 'i know best' and is very confident in her knowledge, which isn't the case with any ESFJ I've met (they put on a front sometimes but ultimately doubt their thinking).

I only really talk about this cognitive functions stuff with a few people, so if I'm unable to phrase things properly that's why.

Also thank you for the advice! I think what you said about giving my life structure makes a lot of sense, since the lack of it seems to be what upsets my mom the most.",1617143550
ESTJ,"That sounds about right, you found fitting words... It's always interesting to see how people are so different!",1617135795
ESTJ,"I do not think it is environment. I think it is natural basic logic:

People are different in terms of quality and value to society. This means society reward ones more and others less. This is neutrally objective way of rewarding people based on their value.

Ps: No, giving more free money does not encourage people to be more productive, it is the opposite - if I can get free money, why work for it.  It is not fantasy socialist utopia land where giving free money makes them work more productive...

So to recap - I do not see this particular point asbeing right vs left, I see it as objectively neutral point (you get compensated based on your value to society).",1617135640

ESTJ,"So hey, a couple of things. 

For starters, I don‚Äôt know your mom, but from what you‚Äôve presented here she reads as Fe-Si, likely an ESFJ not an ESTJ. The reason I‚Äôm going to suggest this isn‚Äôt just to nitpick, but because what appeals to an Fe dom and what appeals to a Te dom aren‚Äôt just different, they‚Äôre often diametrically opposed. 

If your mom IS a TJ, the only way to mend your relationship with her is to prove to her that your way of living has enough structure to guarantee you a successful and happy life; basically, get a job or start headlong down a reasonable career path and she will eventually come around. 

If your mom is an ESFJ, as I suspect, just achieving likely won‚Äôt fix your relationship. What matters to her will be emotional appeals to her Fe and Ti. Prove to her that you value her advice and experience by incorporating aspects of her lifestyle into your life (or pretending to). Hostile ESFJs in my experience can be won over with subtle but steady buttering up. Compliments on things not even related to your issues will improve her mood towards you and might even afford you more freedoms. 

On the subject of risk taking, *especially* drugs, even if they‚Äôre legal there‚Äôs probably no way in hell you‚Äôre going to get her to come around on that. It‚Äôs best to just sober up a little and act like you‚Äôre clean and reformed and then take a toke or two when she‚Äôs off your trail. Is lying good? No. So idk if this is great advice. Still, what she doesn‚Äôt know can‚Äôt hurt her and you‚Äôre running emergency protocols on this dynamic anyways, so, that‚Äôs a call that you‚Äôve got to make. 

Regardless, a big part of growing up in general is learning that your parents are just people, and that for them to respect you as an adult, you need to look like one. If you‚Äôre not in college already, just clearing that hurdle will improve things, as long as you‚Äôre not failing classes. So I guess try to be patient.

Also, not as relevant, but you *gotta* break that shit up into paragraphs, my dude. No one wants to read a big ass block o‚Äôtext like that hahaha",1617123771

ESTJ,"In fact, I did tell him I‚Äôll take the initiative to ask him out again in the future. Of course if I ever had a chance to see him again, I would definitely try to try again with him if he‚Äôs down. I mean, I would DEFINITELY do that if it‚Äôs a month ago. Now that I‚Äôm just dying inside. Anws, thanks again!",1617119357
ESTJ,"Nah, you‚Äôre not letting anyone down. No need to apologize. 

What I‚Äôll say is that when I‚Äôve said I may wanna still be friends, I‚Äôve genuinely meant it *at the time.* I never would‚Äôve imagined not following through with it. But as time passes and I realize I don‚Äôt actually miss or need that person as much as I thought, I just never think to reach out again. One of the hardest parts about breakups for high Si is the disruption to routine, so I think in many cases we tend toward thinking we will reach out because it softens that blow for us and we just assume it‚Äôll be easier, but it isn‚Äôt. In your exes case, he also may have thought he was just being nice. 

While it‚Äôs not something I‚Äôm personally a fan of, I don‚Äôt believe friendship with an ex is impossible. It just requires a lot of time in between the separation and transitioning to something platonic. My best advice here is to be in control of that narrative. I‚Äôve had an ex previously state that there may be opportunity to date again or be friends again in the future - if you are the one being broken up with, the key response is: ‚Äúplease do not contact me of your own accord, I will reach out to you if I ever have interest in friendship again.‚Äù They‚Äôve initiated the breakup so they don‚Äôt get to control when they re-enter your life. You‚Äôre allowed however long you need to heal and you deserve to do that without it being derailed by a ‚Äúhey.‚Äù text 2 months down the line. If you‚Äôre the one doing the breaking up, it‚Äôs on you to let that person have their space for as long as they want (even indefinitely). 

This prevents anyone from waiting by the phone for a text or call that may never come and allows for proper distanced healing without being triggered back to sadness by contact that happens too early.

Best of luck to you.",1617118559
ESTJ,"Sigh, well I dare not to. I agreed to leave him for his sake, no matter true or not, if he‚Äôs so determined in his studies, I shall not disturb him further. I guess leaving silently is my only way out now. Anws, thank you for your kind advice.",1617118385
ESTJ,"I read you comment after I woke up from a nap and it‚Äôs been in my head the whole day. I have never thought of him like that about trying to be nice, but it actually makes sense. Thank you very much, it is helping me get out of this sticky piece of mess.",1617118203
ESTJ,"Neat and precise, thank you so much...",1617118110
ESTJ,"Thank you for your comprehensive advice and sorry for letting you down again. I know that feel when somebody whine about the same old love again and again and I hate to do that too tho I‚Äôm actually doing this. 

It makes perfect sense to me now that when you say you don‚Äôt know what you will be like few months later but you say what you think now. Now that I feel kinda stupid because I don‚Äôt really do that. I do what I say, but I guess I should not have assumed him to do the same. 

In fact, I know myself very well as in if I let go of somebody, I won‚Äôt go back to that person. And now I don‚Äôt let any guys come close to me as a gesture of remaining loyal, for my ex... tho he doesn‚Äôt know about it. Nobody forces me to do this but I just have this thing about cutting everyone out and ‚Äúremaining loyal‚Äù until I am 100% sure he and I won‚Äôt have a chance. 

I genuinely hope this is the last time I post about this guy here and thank you for your wholehearted piece of advice.",1617117965
ESTJ,"I believe I said this on a prior post of yours but I truly can‚Äôt imagine any scenario in which someone I was truly committed to got pushed to the wayside by something like studies / my job / etc. That is not the Te dom way. If we‚Äôre truly invested in a person and in a relationship, we do whatever is necessary to make the time for that person. So if he ended the relationship over his studies, the commitment just wasn‚Äôt there. 

I will also say that in prior relationships of mine during the breakup time, I‚Äôve said that I would still have interest being friends with that person because *at the time* they were so ingrained in my schedule that it felt like we would naturally achieve friendship again after healing from the romantic relationship. **We did not.**

In any cases where I‚Äôve said that, as soon as I‚Äôve started getting over the person romantically, I‚Äôve realized that I don‚Äôt actually have the attachment to them platonically like I thought I‚Äôd have and have not reached out after the fact. This doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm sending mixed signals, because it‚Äôs only something I communicated months prior that I genuinely believed I‚Äôd want - it just means that my feelings have changed. This is why I always encourage both parties to have no contact and work independently at getting over the other, regardless of breakup circumstances. Because you cannot predict how your or their feelings will shift with absence. 

Lastly, actions speak louder than words. If he isn‚Äôt prioritizing you, isn‚Äôt reaching out to you, etc. he is more than likely done with the friendship and relationship. One thing he said during your breakup does not negate the lack of action on his part over the last several months. Look at what he‚Äôs doing, not what he said before. 

Regardless, my best advice for you here is to stop pursuing it and work at moving on. Part of that is not waiting for him to reach out, it‚Äôs behaving as though he never will, because he may not. I wish you the best of luck as I know this can be very hard, but it‚Äôs necessary.",1617117251

ESTJ,"From what I've seen of both types Si heroes (ISTJ) tend to be extremely shy at times, keep to themselves often and are often 'heroic' with their own comfort and duty (find ways to be comfortable with duty). Si parents (ESTJ) tend to reeeally focus on duty (as the parent function is the function of responsibility) and cannot settle until everything they need to get done is done, and only then will they indulge their comfort seeking side. They also find themselves needing to talk about what they're thinking and bounce their ideas off of others, whereas Te parent in ISTJs focuses on collecting information, rather than naturally sharing this information with others (especially with people they are not close with, which for an introvert like an ISTJ, is most people).

One trait that makes it a challenge for me is the fact that I live by rules, standards and models, but as a software PM I need to be able to adapt and consider each situation separately. It's like that saying ""no plan survives contact with the enemy"".

Another trait that poses a challenge for me is that I'm very strict with myself. As a PM you need to be okay with making mistakes because you won't always have all the information. My first few months were horrible because I was too hard on myself and couldn't help but to punish myself even outside of work for my mistakes.

ESTJ,"Ahhh, I see. Okay, first question, how's your brain? Mine is a bit of a dick in that I'm dyslexic (very short working memory, I can put things down, walk away and then 10 seconds later not remember where I put them) and I also get periodic depression which often makes it very hard to find the energy for keeping my habitat tidy - even though I always feel better when the chaos has been contained. 

These two things have way more bearing over my organisational habits than my personality type - but I think my need to engineer for them is rooted in my personality type. So my advice to you is going to be coloured through those lenses. 

Firstly, you probably have too much stuff. 'Stuff' with a capital S is very bad for your habitat. You do not need loads of Stuff. If you 'find' things in drawers and boxes that you forgot you had - you definitely have way, way too much stuff. It is okay to treasure material things, but it's pointless to hold on to things you don't need or treasure - because that shit clutters your life and it becomes a huge barrier to getting shit done. Follow the [Konmari Method](https://shop.konmari.com/collections/the-konmari-method/products/the-life-changing-magic-of-tidying-up-1) and live surrounded by things that spark joy. 

Have a place for everything. The art of this is diversity of storage rather than popping to IKEA and grabbing some huge clear plastic crates that take half an hour to root through in your epic last minute search for that one thing you're sure you put in one of them. The things you use every day will need to be the most accessible. The things you use less often can be packed away. If you live in a small house/apartment, make as much use of your walls as you can. Use shelves, hooks and pegboards to make the most of vertical storage.

You will have very small, small, medium and large things - so you will need storage for very small, small, medium and large things. So, when choosing storage furniture, if you choose (for example) a chest of drawers - you'll be able to store and easily access more things if that chest has shallow *and* deep drawers. Modular storage furniture can be really awesome for this kind of thing, check out IKEA Kallax book cases and Alex drawers. 

Use drawer dividers and smaller boxes inside your storage furniture to help you access what you need quickly and easily - so you only need to root through a little box rather than a whole drawer. 

Organise your storage into specific places. Have a board games shelf, have a batteries drawer, have a charging cables drawer, have a photography cupboard, etc. This way you won't have to remember where everything is, you'll just need to remember which category you filed it under.

When putting something away, tell yourself about it verbally, out loud - this is something that's really helped my asshole dyslexic brain locate things. Verbally telling yourself where you have put something will help you remember where it is. ""Thermometer in bathroom cabinet"", ""keys in blue dish"", etc - you'll sound nuts but it works.  

Only think about it once. If you come across a small task, do it right away. Very often we put off small tasks (because they're small) for a long time until they lurk in our subconscious long enough for us to start to really dread them - it can get overwhelming and you end up with a huge list of things you were supposed to do weeks ago and it can be horribly anxious, and then you *really* don't want to do it. 

Apps like Our Home can help you schedule your routine household tasks, so you only have to think about that once as well. 

I also cannot recommend [Unfuck Your Habitat ](https://www.unfuckyourhabitat.com/category/challenges/mini-challenges/) enough.

ESTJ,"I see Ne in your post, so ESTJ is very likely.",1615964340
ESTJ,"Okay, I'll do my best to help out with what I know. There really isn't a single answer for this. You are going to have to fill in your personal goals into the equation.

1. Best online Business. This really depends on what skills you have or what products you have access too. There are also other variables, where do you plan to sell?I tried selling on shopify a few years back. I saved up a few hundred dollars and gave it a shot. I made a page, bought a domain, found a product, made advertisements, hired influencers, made Instagram and facebook ad campaigns etc. I spent around $250 and in the end sold one product. What I learned from that was that unless you have a niche product (and you'd know if you actually have one) then the shopify route isn't for you. On the other hand, my friend had a supplier for a product that was/(sometimes) is in high demand. He found his buyers on a message board and made his sales through there. He didn't have a landing page or any official online business presence, yet he was able to make a  few grand here and there. If you are not looking to sell a physical product online, what do you bring to the table? What knowledge or expertise do  you have that others would want to buy from you? Are you a good video editor? Graphic designer? Are you good at programming? etc. If you have any skills that others would need, that is another option. (One of my current projects is building websites for small organizations and small businesses. I don't charge them anything for it atm, as I am using the work on my personal portfolio). unless you hit the jackpot with one of your online businesses, you are going to have to treat them all as side hustles. (Also, I do not suggest selling/dropshipping on ebay, not worth the hassle at all).
2. For education, This is also difficult as it really depends on who you are as a person. If you are a bit on the fence about getting a degree, look into trades (they aren't for everyone). I personally am pursuing a degree in Computer Science. One of the main reasons why I chose it was my love for technology and the pay that Computer Science graduates get. If you are looking to get a degree just for the experience, look at the pay that people with the degree you want to get receive out of college. Most degrees now require further education past a Bachelors's degree. It is really brutal out there, and many people make the mistake of going into debt for a degree that they probably could have made their hobby instead. Try and look at a degree as a tool to earning money rather than viewing it as ""what I think my life direction will be."" You can also look online at places like [coursera.com](https://coursera.com) and find some certificates to earn in order to get jobs. Im currently working on a certificate made by google on coursera for python programming (it is pretty simple as I have already done a lot of programming, but it helps show my skills to potential employers while I am still working on my degree). 

Really ask yourself what you want out of life? What do you wish to achieve? What personal goals do you have? Really think about it before committing to a degree or career path that may lock you in for a while. I personally have my own personal goals and hobbies that keep me happy. School and work don't hold nearly as much weight to me. 

hope this helps a bit.",1615956272

An ENTJ is stronger in Extroverted Sensing which is about calling people to action and are more likely to push people out of their comfort zones and reject people's personal barriers if they don't like them.

ESTJs keep people around based on mutual interests and groups. For instance, they might attend a hobby or social group and probably won't leave unless someone really doesn't respect their barriers or their schedules change. From there, we might establish some really strong, special relationships but that's more of a surprise.

ESTJ,"I feel like you're writing like an ESTJ. We tend to focus on the important points that distinguish between things. We do that for a lot of things and hate when people confuse things together that should be separated.  


A lot of us like fantasy and stories. This stuff tends to tease our Extroverted Intuition, which is about exploring possibilities. It's not our first or second function but it's close.

Some other thoughts:  
ESTJs have trouble thinking about their future. We're driven by curiosity and if someone asks us what we will be doing in 5 years, our best answer is both the same thing I am now and a lot of wild things like starting our own country or a nuclear power plant.  


Introverted Sensing is about knowing your gut feelings and reactions. It sounds kind of like your paragraph 2. It can also include natural understandings for distances, how much stuff can fit in a space, how to organize things spatially, when a timer will be done, and how long it will take to get somewhere + time for mistakes or emergencies.  


Most philosophy is heavily Introverted Thinking. It's really hard to write anything from Introverted Sensing and most philosophy uses Introverted functions. All types can find something interesting in religion and spirituality though. I wouldn't use that to type someone, though the angle that they take would be useful. Similarly, your job isn't necessarily a good indicator though how you go about it might be.",1615940335

ESTJ,"&gt;I thought imagination and fantasy might apply more to intuitive people over sensing.

Not necessarily, I consider myself very imaginative but only when I can relax in my free time. That's connected with Ne aka extraverted intuition which is one of our functions.

I don't really know how to explain it in general but Intuitives generally give meaning, appreciate connecting the dots and things that have a deeper meaning and while sensors can understand it they don't care for that sort of thought too much.

&gt;I heard that ESTJs can be quite loud and stressed and have trouble with relaxing, while I'm personally laid back

This definitely applies to me at least the relaxation part or at least to a great extent, but you can learn to stop being that way and I manage to relax way more in company than I did before by simply not taking myself too seriously which a lot of ESTJs struggle with.

ESTJ,"If I'm not mistaken the ""definition"", or in the very least, summary of Ni is:

Introverted Intuition will take pieces of abstract information and make sense of it. It is not interested so much in concrete facts, as it is with the essence of ideas and theories, and how they all fit together.
-personalitygrowth.com

For me, as I believe I am an ESTJ, having Ni in my blindspot means that I can categorize information that I obtain in great detail but I'm not able to synthesize my categorized information into a thing or wholistic product without conscious/deliberate effort. My mother is an INTJ and I've observed first hand how she just comes up with product ideas ""out of nowhere"" related to software development (she's a software dev and I'm working on becoming one as well). Whereas I can maybe sorta do something like that where I engage my hard-drive Si and, see what I can come up with tertiary Ne. If I may go on a tangent, I have noticed that both Ni and Si are fantastic for programming. Ni users have an advantage in the realm of understanding new concepts a quicker while Si users can literally memorize the formats for large chunks of code and then churn them back out in a code editor like no-one's buisness.

As far as long term thinking goes. I am more than capable of making a plan that spans months into the future and sticking with it. However, I do not hold the future in mind or with as much reverence as do the Ni users that I know. I don't know if it is an ESTJ trait. But I can be very in the moment, like an SP type. I was just playing for-way volleyball with my friends and I had no issue keeping track of where the 4 or 5 volleyballs were coming from and my suspected ISTJ friend literally said ""I don't know where to look"". That's probably an Se critic thing but again, I digress.

When it comes to fear, I don't necessarily fear the future,  but I want to be ready for it. From my personal experience, people with Ni higher in their cognitive stack generally have a brighter outlook on the future. Probably because that's their fort√®. But when it comes to me, I neither see the future as bleek, nor rosy. I just do what I can to set myself up for success in the future, as well as the present. Like being physically in-shape at all times and making workout plans for the future so that I advance at a steady pace.

Summary:
Though I do not understand Ni to the greatest extent as do its users, I greatly appreciate those who use it to better the futures of themselves and others. I can combine my Si and Ne to make things like Ni does subconsciously. Likewise, presence of mind is favored over the internal booting sequence of Ni types when subconsciously churning up concepts/ideas. Fear of the future/love of the future is a net 0 for this ESTJ (though I can operate in the context of months and years but any dimension beyond that is difficult for me to process).

And a museum. And dead dinosaurs in it. And an editing studio. A recording studio. A completely silent room. And a party room. Simulation room for VR and flight sims. An arcade. A military training course. A gym. A racetrack. And own a factory with an r&amp;d department producing smart prosthetics, robots, neural interfaces, exoskeletons, drones, nanomachines, and reviving dinosaurs just for the heck of it.

When I'm talking design at work, I'll try to nail people down to concrete language when they're talking about abstract concepts. Often, they'll refuse and try to restate it in terms of another abstract concept and I'll think that I got it wrong, but we're just speaking different languages.",1615431258
ESTJ,"Hey bro, it's easy to understand. Should've asked me first now that you know me. 
Anyways, Ni is a sort of abstract memory. It's not related to sensations, just abstract pictures. If I want to remember something, its general usage appears in my head. Though I lose a lot of details in the process, so it's only good for specific tasks that don't require being extremely consistent. 
Ni remembers stuff that is only valuable for the goal, because it is trying to fit the information into this goal. 
Usually I cannot remember stuff deliberately, 
but when I need it, it pops up in my head, as though it was me who thought about it in the first place. But given that I forget everything unrelated to my goals, I know I just forget the source of information, keeping only the information itself, stripped to the basics. Maybe for Ni doms it's a bit better. 
So it's pretty easy to gaslight me if it's something unimportant.

You don't need to be perfect, you just need to meet the benchmarks that lead to satisfactory end-states.

ESTJ,"I'm not an expert in MBTI, but for me the idea of energy with extraversion helps. When I am around a lot of people, I become energized. I want more interaction, I can go from conversation to conversation, I become my true and happy self. After a long night, I may need a break but it isn't very long. It might take an hour or up to a day, but then I am ready to get back out and extravert. My wife on the other hand, she can converse with the best of them, she seems like she is enjoying herself and she is, but after a night out with a group of people, she doesn't want to see another person for the rest of the weekend. She becomes very exhausted by it, where I am ready to go.   


This is how I was explained E vs I, and it makes sense to me. Also, if you want to know for sure I would find a MBTI certified instructor to take the test with and go over the data. Lots of people have read about it, but you'd also be helping to provide income for the person who has become an expert in the material, and I believe it will give you piece of mind.

ESTJ,Hahaha same. As you get older though you accept the mistakes and imperfection more.,1615221076
ESTJ,"‚ÄúPerfect is the enemy of good.‚Äù

I‚Äôve also struggled with perfectionism a lot and in my career, perfection is something you really have to accept is not always (or often) an option. Sufficient and on time is better than perfect and late or not done at all. 

It is ultimately realizing that something that is late or not done is far closer to imperfect than good and on time is. And if you finish that good option, there is often time to review and make changes to it to satisfy your perfectionism later.

My ENTJ mentor contextualized it like this:

If your job was to wash 100 windows and you had a limited time period, what has a greater impact? Washing all 100 windows but not to your greatest ability? Or washing 20 windows perfectly? 

Well, the ‚Äúperfect but incomplete‚Äù option here leaves many floors and windows with little to no visibility and only people that see the few you did will be impressed or know you did a good job. 

But if you give people the ability to see from all 100 windows, even if they‚Äôre a little streaky, it will have far greater impact. 

Just something to think on.",1615218585
ESTJ,"Yeah I mean I can‚Äôt speak to your ESTJ friend‚Äôs willingness to alter his life circumstances but what I‚Äôll say is that I‚Äôve done long distance just to be with the right person and can cite multiple ESTJs that have taken great strides to be with the right person for them - moving their spouse to an entirely new country, moving 24 hours away and leaving where they grew up behind for their partner. We‚Äôre competitive people - if we want something, we don‚Äôt want to risk losing it to another person. So we are direct and we take action. 

But yes I agree that the end game here is that you have to take a step back. As soon as romantic feelings start getting muddled with the platonic, it‚Äôs a fast route to mess and drama, especially if one of the people involved isn‚Äôt single. And as a final point, the ideal would be you not having to guess if someone is into you or not - it would be clear, irrespective of their MBTI type. So prioritize you and your mental health. Best of luck",1615217976
ESTJ,"You may never have had a concept of self. Writing about yourself for a year or so as part of your leisure time may help.

Reading helps too.",1615177165
ESTJ,"Recognize that perfectionism is stupid to begin with and that failure to accept normality leads to greater consequences than being normal. Not that being normal is necessarily negative.

Could try changing up win and loss conditions. Setting margins. Slow and steady is good enough a lot of the time. Max output I'd reserve for crunch. Lowering the bar not necessarily bad, especially if the bar was set too high.

Avoiding burnout is far more valuable than maintaining high velocity for longer stretches. We're running a marathon after all. Short, controlled bursts seem reasonable to me.

Do some catastrophizing. What's the worst that could happen were you to push yourself so hard for so long that you'd no longer be able to even operate normally?

There's your consequence. Write it down. Tattoo it onto your forehead (don't do this). Call your mother and tell her about it. Obligate the people around you to help you maintain yourself so you don't have to remind yourself every day. Accept that you are going to fail regardless of how hard you try.

Would you need to read a book in order to accept that you can't bring your a-game every day? I'm telling you to accept that you have limitations right now. Why not just do what I tell you instead of seeking out some garbage content that will only waste your time?

Inability to perform 100% at all times? Go lay on the floor and make meek, squeaky noises while throwing household objects in all directions, arbitrarily.

I don't think you're evil or psychopathic. As long as you're being truthful and genuine, I don't think you're doing anything bad. 

I do think that if the bond was stronger you wouldn't do that and that if you did then that'd be worth analysing more than your behaviour with internet friends.",1614900281

ESTJ,"This is very subjective and you sound like you don't wanna change (which is valid).

Personally, I care about being reciprocal and fair. If you ask me what I think about you after reading your post, I find what you do quite evil, and a little psychopathic. 

That's just my opinion. I don't treat people like that, and the times I have found out that I did I've felt like shit, even if it was by accident.",1614898666

ESTJ,"I recommend learning more about the other types. I used to search up a lot of characters, Instagram bingo's and read about how my type would react (for example Tumblr posts) . They're not 100% correct, but you might feel more at home with another personality type as you read into these. Perhaps you're INFJ?",1614881872
ESTJ,The Enneagram might help you center yourself a little more. It deals more with how traumatic things in your past morphed you into the person you are today. Branching out into other assessments that you know little about can help you to find yourself and not have a predisposed bias towards one thing or another. That's what I did because I could fudge the results of MBTI tests depending on how I wanted to see myself as instead of asking myself what I actually preferred. Just my thoughts but I hope it helps.,1614876579
ESTJ,"Not an ESTJ, but I'm starting to see why our types are compatible. Because that literally doesn't bother me at all, as long as I'm not actually losing anything by it. You can take advantage of your connection with someone and still respect them. I do think it's important to care about other people's feelings, and ideally other people would benefit from knowing you too, but this mindset doesn't necessarily exclude being a caring person. That's a balance you have to find for yourself, in order to avoid trampling on people or, at the other end, failing to reach your potential.  


So if your friend says you don't care about his feelings, chances are that's not coming out of nowhere, and you might be showing a pattern of behaviors that have led him to saying that. But you don't have to change who you are in order to treat him better. Ask what he wants from you and try to do that.",1614868163
ESTJ,"I like ISTPs. They're chill, don't like a lot of drama usually, the ones I've met were loyal and kind under their exterior. They can be a little cold at times but I don't think they actually mean to be. The other thing is as most introverts, they like being alone so whenever my ISTP friends were upset I'd want to talk to them or help and they didn't so I felt like I was being a bad friend by not helping. In reality, by not pushing them I probably was helping.",1614863077

ESTJ,I always need some social outlet on a daily basis. The quarantine was super hard for the E in me and I struggle to find that social outlet daily but dog parks have helped. I‚Äôm also the one who constantly plans things and it can be exhausting especially since now I have trained people to know I will so they don‚Äôt. I also know I can be counted on and driven. Bordering bossy but mostly because my J part says things should be done in the most efficient logical way. I feel practical and capable. The most ETSJ trait I feel is the freedom to share my opinion or thoughts. Like doesn‚Äôt everyone do this I thought?! But they don‚Äôt. So sometimes I put my foot in my mouth. And I have a hard time biting my tongue. But as I get older I am learning to do that. But I also feel there are right ways and wrong ways to do things. I also learned I don‚Äôt have to lead. I am a great second in command or the person behind the person so to speak. But if I have to respect and believe in my leader otherwise I will leave. I feel a lot of sense of ease of knowing that I can make a decision and move on and pivot where I have to. I don‚Äôt dwell.

NPs live in the future and SPs live in the present. I‚Äôve been reading a lot of inspirational quotes and really trying to redirect my thoughts to the present when I find myself remembering past events or things.

We're both pretty level-headed, which means our ""fights"" are pretty mild.

Similarly, as an Introvert, he hates going to social events like Christmas parties, but he knows I'll always go with him because I enjoy it. And he gives me a way to get out of things if I'm not feeling it. 

We both have a strong work ethic and focus a lot on our own careers and success, but fully support the other. It's nice because we can go for HOURS not talking to each other while we're working at home, and neither of us feel any less connected with each other.",1614809992

However, ESTJ/ENTJs often show less emotion. Often we go by the quote  ''S*howing emotion is a sign of weakness.''* This quote took over my entire mind after I was hurt.

If you‚Äôve already shown him your support and loyalty through prior interactions, the rest of the work must be done on his part. It‚Äôs not something you can do on his behalf via trying to convince him more heavily that it isn‚Äôt scary to fall in love.

We lose our sense of identity a lot due to placing a lot of our identity on how we work, or professionally perform, and it is both draining and makes us lose ourselves when we leave those environments. Our personality starts to feel like a job, sometimes, if that makes sense? And when we are out of that professional environment, but still act the same out of it, it gets both confusing to ourselves and others with how we are perceived.

ESTJ,"So I might be a rare breed amongst ESTJs. Lots of people see us as very type-A personalities, very large and in charge types. 

But at least for me? I can be personable and personal under the right circumstances. Maybe it‚Äôs just because of my cashier job and how I need to keep a happy demeanor throughout my shift, haha! But regardless, there are things ESTJs like:

-Organization
-Order
-Attention to Detail
-Accepting the ESTJ‚Äôs point of view (I‚Äôll explain and elaborate in a bit.)
-Don‚Äôt be put off if they have to write hangouts or appointments with you in their calendars or planners.

So as a roommate to 2 close friends of mine...friends who are very much different than me in terms of organization...it drives me batty when I come home to my messy apartment...honestly, it‚Äôs only been a month, but We‚Äôre getting started on getting things keeping things orderly and organized, and I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôll stay that way. 

As for Attention to Detail? Be mindful of the little things. My roommate, I gotta admire his willingness to clean the house while he‚Äôs the only one home (he doesn‚Äôt work), but he really doesn‚Äôt pay close attention to detail while doing it. He might be able to clean dishes quickly, but I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I‚Äôve had to clean a dish some more after it‚Äôs already been washed...because it has a gross film, some spots, or grime...just some effort would be enough to clean those. The fastest way to an ESTJ‚Äôs heart is through cleanliness, organization, and order. At least for me.

We also love planning and organizing ourselves. So don‚Äôt be surprised if you want to hang out and your ESTJ buddy says ‚Äúyeah I‚Äôll write it in my calendar/planner!‚Äù If any ESTJs are like me, we‚Äôre HUGE workhorses. At least, I am. As a result, we often have to write things down in order to keep them cemented and planned, or most simply, so we don‚Äôt forget while we‚Äôre getting everything done. ESTJs are a nice even mix between ‚Äúdoer‚Äù and ‚Äúplanner‚Äù. We can excel at making plans, but are just as capable putting them into action. Oftentimes it‚Äôs off-putting to others, because they usually have one ore the other.

Now accepting their points of view. Does that mean you have to agree with them on everything? Not really. What it means is you acknowledge they have their own opinions, thoughts, and beliefs, and that you accept them and realize they have opposing viewpoints than you. It doesn‚Äôt mean you have to agree with everything they say, nor does it mean you should try to convince them of something they don‚Äôt want to believe. For example: my roommate and I are almost like brothers. He and I have great in-depth discussions about hot topics. In some cases, we have differences of opinions we don‚Äôt agree on, and I work my best to accept where my roommate is coming from, even if I might not see where he‚Äôs coming from, or if I don‚Äôt agree with it. But I do accept his views in the end...as for him though? He has to make his point known, and try to persuade you to it. On the outside I‚Äôm fine...but inside? My gears are grinding, and I‚Äôm getting pretty frustrated deep down...

Basically? Just treat them as you‚Äôd like to be treated. Not only is it the golden rule, but they might just surprise you at some point!",1614148328

What I do struggle with is understanding how I feel. I've made some progress with my last therapist and now I'm able to identify certain symptoms and tendencies, but I still struggle to be aware of how I'm feeling. 

For example, sometimes ill feel like I want to eat, but I'm not hungry. Then, since I ate even tho I wasn't hungry, I feel bloated and that sucks. Then I ask myself why and my subconciousness says ""because fuck you I hate you"". After I analyse that, I conclude that I'm punishing myself, so I ask myself why again. Then I realise I'm punishing myself for not taking care of myself and instead eating food to fill the void. All of that could be avoided if I was aware of my feelings. I'd simply go ""oh shit I have a big ass void to fill with love, maybe I should work on loving myself more"".",1614120372

ESTJ,"Hi guys,

This is the most self-centred posts I ever posted... and that‚Äôs the only post I ever posted lol. I just don‚Äôt know where to vent, sorry... I don‚Äôt really trust mental health advisors/ psychologists. They all have their own point view, and don‚Äôt necessarily understand the ESTJ pov. (and shouting at loved ones and colleagues doesn‚Äôt really help... I tried lol)
I‚Äôve been having suicidal thoughts since teenagehood, my trust &amp; faith in God is the only thing that gets me going. During corona pandemic my depression got even worse, but it gave me a great opportunity to analyse myself. I had very disturbing feelings popping up, feelings that I used to suppress systematically without even knowing. I recently remembered that I never really mourned the loss of my grandma when I was 5, so I cried... 23 years later. I‚Äôve been also processing sexual abuses (yes, in  f**ing plural) that I went through, crazy teachers smashing pupils head at primary school (they would only hit underperforming students, so I became an A+ student to survive), bullying at high school (or did I start bullying first lol?). 
At university, I focused fully on my studies, I used to organise study groups... and I wouldn‚Äôt pay attention to my health. I used to be on a chocolate &amp; coffee only ‚Äúdiet‚Äù, no sleep &amp; intense cramming sessions before exams. My health got f***ed up as a result. Then, I had to become refugee, I went through a torturous 5year process to get a refugee leave. 

Now, I‚Äôm blessed to live in a safe country and work at a high paying job. However, I‚Äôm still used to overly focus on my never ending to-do list, but now I‚Äôm like ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the point of it, it‚Äôs never ending, I‚Äôll never be on top of it‚Äù. I‚Äôm also afraid of asking for a raise lol. Still not feeling to be good enough.
I also suffer from chronic joint &amp; muscle pain, fatigue, gastric problems (see university period). Went to a couple of doctors a couple of years ago. They couldn‚Äôt really diagnose the illness, some of them told me that the pain is all in my head, and should just check out mini-exercise vids on YouTube. Wtf, really? You‚Äôre not even gonna try to help me?... Oddly, scheduling a doctors appointment for my own self is the hardest thing to do (don‚Äôt wanna do it during global pandemic either, docs are overwhelmed). The process seems complicated, useless, &amp; I‚Äôm tired. I can do it for strangers down the street, but not myself, wtf. 
It feels like people are using me sometimes, so I lash out at them. I feel very insecure &amp; not confident deep down. It feels like my identity is about to dissolve or something. The worst thing that ever happened to me is when I fell in love for the first time at the age of 26. It felt like someone is stabbing me 24/7. I got oddly happy/sad, I couldn‚Äôt sleep, my hormones went on a rollercoaster, in short - it was/still is horrible. The guy has a girlfriend, but was flirting with me, what an asshole, I think he‚Äôs ISTP. As you can see, my love life is non-existent. Well, my bar is high - I‚Äôd like to marry my soulmate. Dating apps make me cringe, I just hate them. I wish I could meet the guy &amp; know that‚Äôs the one straight away - very efficient. Anybody interested in a psycho ESTJ with issues (sound repetitive)? Swipe right. Call me. Actually, don‚Äôt - just write something nice in the comment. I‚Äôm probably not gonna reply, cuz you f***ing know everything about me now, idiot. 
I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs the reason behind the venting here.. hormones? I‚Äôm not holding grudges against anybody, I know it‚Äôs all my fault (I‚Äôm tired of blaming myself for everything tho). The psycho teachers I had are also ESTJs, have some merci. 

So, anybody can relate? Or am I the only one...
In that case, I hope I inspired you to create some decent fun memes for ESTJs - do them already, I‚Äôm tired of waiting!

ESTJ,"Sorry ahead of time if this gets long. My mom and I have never really been able to see eye to eye. She is constantly afraid that I'll turn out like my ESTP dad (they're divorced) but often drives me into angry conflicts (and I HATE conflict) in which I am often in my ESTP super ego, which doesn't help. The core issue is my need for freedom as an ENFP. Not just in the physical sense of where I go and when, but my life choices tend to be random and according to what I feel is the best for me at the time, which frustrates her because she never knows where I'm headed and feels no security or belief in my life's choices. With her need to control chaos, she often comes off extremely controlling and supremely nosey, and even though I know she means well and thinks her nagging will help me, it often does the opposite. Seeing as I often have (Ne) plans that are in form of possibilities, I often don't know what my end goal is due to lack of Ni. Her trying to instill her Si parent into my Si inferior simply doesn't work because my sense of duty has to be connected to Fi passion or care, not systems and institutions, I have 0 duty towards systematic points of view (part of me wishes I did, it would help me succeed more in school etc). Now I'm not saying I'm completely not to blame for our rocky relationship, but that's why I'm here. After learning so much about Jungian cognitive functions I understand I've been accidentally triggering all her pessimistic functions just as she has mine. For example I would constantly ask what she wants me to do (Ne hero), but due to her Ne trickster, she has no idea what she wants, and wants me to know what I want (With Ne child) which is difficult with my lack of Ni in the ego. I constantly worry about what I want (Ni nemesis), but I cannot settle on a specific want and pursue it. I understand that my lack of willpower and duty infuriate her as she feels it brings up chaos and uncertainty. It doesn't help that I have lied to her a lot from the time I was young as a way to take back my freedom. This removes any trust she has in me, since her pessimistic Si parent assumes everything bad that happened before will happen again, not only that I won't listen to her, again, but that I will 'become just like my father and uncle' (both ESTPs who never finished high school and do what they want and often hurt people around them). As an fyi, I'm pretty sure my mom's not the healthiest ESTJ, plus she married an ISTJ and they live pretty Si routine and chaos free on their own. I'm aware I bring a lot of stress into their lives, seeing as I smoke weed and hang out with my friends pretty late and also dropped out of college after a devastating breakup followed by a diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder. I KNOW I'm a lot to handle for both of them. The reason I'm posting this here, is hopefully to get other ESTJs perspectives and advice on how better to comfort and reassure her (I am doing my best to be honest with her, since I know lying is definitely the worst thing to do to anyone). She's been trying to understand me through my diagnosis (which is helpful considering she used to dismiss or judge me for my symptoms), since her Te unfortunately trust a psychiatrists credentials more than it trusts me. Her understanding of my wandering Ne mind is minimal at best, but with this diagnosis she's understanding a little bit of what I go through on the daily (overwhelming Fi-Si loops) and why I act the way I do sometimes. Still, this isn't really about me. I want to understand how to help her through all of this since I know it's hard on her, especially since a diagnosis of bpd is connected to childhood trauma and she's definitely worried about where she went wrong with me. Do you think spending some time with her and letting her teach me stuff like sowing and cooking (she's really good at those and loves to teach) is a good way to reconnect and build a positive relationship? What other advice do you have for anyone trying to understand an estj and their anger outbursts? Any ideas for conflict de-escalation that might help me help an angry estj? 

Thank you to anyone who might read through all of this, I know it's a lot but I'd highly appreciate any advice or input.

P.S. Due to the bad experiences with my mom, I certainly have had a bias against her type, just because of the sheer clash I encounter with her. I'm trying to be less hostile around estjs and trying to understand them better. I think as a parent they're hardly a good fit for an enfp (and vice versa!), but I'm trying to see how I'd go about befriending ESTJs, appreciating them more for their qualities and wonders, and properly caring for them, as well as learning how to alleviate their Fi fear and make them comfortable and happy. My mom's been trying to understand me, so I'm here, doing my best to understand her. Any advice on how to do any of this would be a blessing, because no matter our types, I want my mom to not be constantly stressed and I want us to have a mutually fulfilling relationship.",1617095887
ESTJ,"Hello fellas, I‚Äôm heart-broken and really need your advice. 

Broke up with him in February. On the day when we broke up, he didn‚Äôt want to let go but he eventually chose to let go because he couldn‚Äôt manage the pressure from both studies and relationship at the same time. He said the mood swing brought by the relationship caused him huge pressure and terribly affected his studies. He said he wanted to treat me like a little sister and still keep contact and hangout from time to time (the role is not the point, I think he meant he wanted me to still have a place in his life). I told him to update me with his grade release because I care about him. He promised me.

After we broke up, he never contacted me anymore, let alone updating me about his grade. Few weeks ago, I missed him terribly and decided to ask him how he was. He replied but it was quite cold and he made me feel like I was an acquittance to him. He didn‚Äôt ask anything about me. Yesterday, I reached out to try to ask him some advice related to his major. I explained it‚Äôs a bit complicated so I wanted to give him a quick call. It took him 17 hours to reply: ‚Äúor voice message?‚Äù. Yes, he might be busy but at the same time he was trying to avoid everything more than messages. 

I just don‚Äôt get it. I‚Äôm not prepared for this. Like if he told me it‚Äôs over and don‚Äôt even contact no more, I would definitely move on and be cool. He used to always take every promise in his life seriously (I think it‚Äôs an ESTJ trait too).

ESTJ,"I'm still figuring out if I'm ESTJ or ENTJ. I have settled on ESTJ now, although there's some things that might fit better in the ENTJ type.

I think I might be too sensitive to be ESTJ. I know ESTJs can definitely be sensitive, but my mood can switch so fast. I can read other people really well, too. I know exactly how they're feeling, but I won't always put effort into changing it. I do take other's feeling into account though, I can adept myself really easily to another's mood and make sure I say/do the right things. I can immediately tell what the other person does/doesn't want at that moment. &lt; I won't do this with people I dislike (bosses not included) I will go against them and they will notice I dislike them rather sooner than later.

The next thing is; I value fantasy a lot. Drawing is one of my hobbies and I've always admired supernatural creatures such as mermaids, dragons, fairies. I love enchanted forests and lakes, Disney and other fantasy/adventure films. Nature and animals in general means everything to me as well. I would go on vacation to be surrounded by nature; the ocean, forests, valleys, mountains, islands... I care way less about cities. I also like letting my mind wander while listening to beautiful soundtracks.

It's not like I believe in supernatural things; science is knowledge and wisdom. That's obviously a thinker-thought (I do want to believe in the afterlife. For past-present-future oriented... I'm not sure. I prefer how some things were in the past, but with other things I don't mind changing it for the better. I am the kind of person who is really ambitious and who will say ''Just watch me, I'll become a CEO in the department of ........, and I'll get a house at the sea, with ... and .....'' for example. I'm a big dreamer, but I don't have any future job specifics on my mind as of now.

Furthermore I don't tolerate nonsense which I think is natural for ExTJ. - I can be quite charming and flirty if I feel like it. - People have also told me I am intimidating even though I'm not a loud person. - I'm an optimist, even though I fear failure.

ESTJ,"Please hear me out. I know Ni sounds unrelated to ESTJs, but let me just explain myself first.

So I am having a bit of trouble understanding what Ni is and how it works. So naturally, I went to the Ni doms' subreddit and asked them for their opinions.

However, I realized that asking an Ni dom to explain Ni, is a bit like using a flamethrower to transfer fuel. Sure, it might work, but there's every chance of an explosion. Instead, what I've found useful in understanding a cognitive function is having it as a blindspot. ESxJs have Ni as their blindspot, which makes you guys the most suitable candidates for this.

I get that this might be a bit much to ask, but here goes. For example, I'm an INTP and I have an Se blindspot. I've noticed this manifest throughout my life. Not noticing details, missing announcements in school have been a common occurrence for me. This is how I managed to gain a bit of insight into what Se might be. I'm looking for something similar, just with Ni. I'd love it if you could give me specific examples from your lives where you felt that you've missed this kind of perception. Hopefully, that might help.",1615393111

ESTJ,"Hello, everyone I recently have been studying about sensory processing sensitivity (SPS) which is an attribute of highly sensitive persons (HSPs). I am curious to see if certain MBTI types are more likely to be HSPs than others, so I am going to post a poll in each subreddit about this. **You can find out if you are an HSP by taking the following test:** [**Are You Highly Sensitive? ‚Äì The Highly Sensitive Person (hsperson.com)**](https://hsperson.com/test/highly-sensitive-test/)**. A score higher than 14 on this test indicates that you might have SPS (you are an HSP).** If you do not like the binary nature of this test you can take the version used by researchers here: [Microsoft Word - HSPSCALE\_2007\_research.doc (hsperson.com)](http://hsperson.com/pdf/HSPSCALE_2007_research.pdf). A score of 105 or higher on this version indicates that you likely are an HSP (I calculated this cutoff by using the cutoff for the shorter version which is 15/27 possible points and assuming that the same percentage of points on the longer test indicates that you are an HSP). **If you are willing please take the test to see if you are an HSP and then fill out the poll below. Thank you.**

I am also going to post some research articles here for those of you who would like to learn more about HSPs and the research behind it (I am quoting from another post that I made about this):

""Hello everybody, I have recently been looking at various studies regarding HPSs. To be honest when I first heard about HSPs I thought that the idea was either a false pop psychology idea, or autism spectrum disorder or anxiety disguised under a fancy name. However, after reading the studies I will list below I am now convinced that sensory processing sensitivity (SPS) is real and that being an HSP is a unique, valid concept. I believe these studies are useful to get an in-depth understanding of what it truly means to be an HSP and they can also be useful to show that the idea of HSPs is valid. Here are the studies:

[The functional highly sensitive brain: a review of the brain circuits underlying sensory processing sensitivity and seemingly related disorders (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5832686/) (Discusses fMRI studies of SPS in comparison to autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, and post-traumatic stress disorder. This review shows that SPS is its own separate, unique trait and is different from the previously mentioned disorders)

[The highly sensitive brain: an fMRI study of sensory processing sensitivity and response to others' emotions - PubMed (nih.gov)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25161824/) (Provides evidence that higher HSP scores are correlated with ‚Äústronger activation of brain regions involved in awareness, empathy, and self-other processing‚Äù)

[The trait of sensory processing sensitivity and neural responses to changes in visual scenes (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3023077/) (‚ÄúSPS was associated with significantly greater activation in brain areas involved in high-order visual processing (i.e. right claustrum, left occipitotemporal, bilateral temporal and medial and posterior parietal regions) as well as in the right cerebellum, when detecting minor (*vs* major) changes in stimuli.‚Äù)

[Sensory Processing Sensitivity Predicts Individual Differences in Resting-State Functional Connectivity Associated with Depth of Processing - PubMed (nih.gov)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33561863/) (‚ÄúThe present study showed that SPS is associated with \[resting-state\] brain connectivity implicated in attentional control, consolidation of memory, physiological homeostasis, and deliberative cognition. These results support theories proposing ""depth of processing"" as a central feature of SPS and highlight the neural processes underlying this cardinal feature of the trait.‚Äù)

[Higher sensory processing sensitivity, introversion and ectomorphism: New biomarkers for human creativity in developing rural areas (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3409988/) (Discusses various aspects of SPS such as its involvement in creativity and also its presence in animals)

[Temperament trait of sensory processing sensitivity moderates cultural differences in neural response (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2894664/) (‚ÄúHere, 10 European-Americans and 10 East Asians underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing simple visuospatial tasks emphasizing judgments that were either context independent (typically easier for Americans) or context dependent (typically easier for Asians). As reported elsewhere, each group exhibited greater activation for the culturally non-preferred task in frontal and parietal regions associated with greater effort in attention and working memory. However, further analyses, reported here for the first time, provided preliminary support for moderation by SPS. Consistent with the careful-processing theory, high-SPS individuals showed little cultural difference; low-SPS, strong culture differences.‚Äù)

However, in contrast to Aron and Aron‚Äôs finding that the scale is unidimensional, the current results support a three-component structure consisting of Aesthetic Sensitivity (AES), Low Sensory Threshold (LST), and Ease of Excitation (EOE).‚Äù ‚ÄúAES showed the strongest relation with Openness to Experience, while LST and EOE were found to be most closely associated with Neuroticism.‚Äù Unfortunately, this study is not free access, but if you are a student or faculty at a school you might be able to get access to the full text through your institution.)

[The relationships between sensory processing sensitivity, alexithymia, autism, depression, and anxiety - ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886908001281) (‚ÄúThe goal of the current investigation was to better understand the relationships between the three recently-developed factors of sensory processing sensitivity (ease of excitation ‚Äì EOE, low sensory threshold ‚Äì LST, and aesthetic sensitivity ‚Äì AES) and alexithymia, autism symptoms, anxiety, and depression. Two hundred and one college students completed the highly sensitive person scale, as well as measures of anxiety, depression, alexithymia, and autism symptoms. EOE and LST were related to autism symptoms, alexithymia, anxiety, and depression. AES was related to attention to details (a symptom of autism) and anxiety but not to depression. It was also negatively related to externally-oriented thinking (a symptom of alexithymia). Results indicate that AES is conceptually distinct from LST and EOE. Furthermore, EOE interacted with difficulty identifying feelings in predicting anxiety, indicating that being both easily excited by stimuli and unable to identify one‚Äôs feelings is particularly anxiety provoking.‚Äù)

[A psychometric evaluation of the Highly Sensitive Person Scale in ethnically and culturally heterogeneous South African samples | SpringerLink](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12144-020-00988-7) (The HSPS scale was tested for cross-cultural reliability via administration of the test to a group of students from a South African university. The HSPS scale was found to be reliable in this study and ‚ÄúFactor analysis revealed a novel five-factor solution (Negative Affect, Neural Sensitivity, Propensity to Overwhelm, Careful Processing and Aesthetic Sensitivity). As per previous reports, latent class analysis suggested a three class solution.‚Äù The study also discusses some weaknesses of the HSPS scale that could be improved such as the lack of reverse-coding in the assessment to address agreeability bias (i.e. reversing statements to make them negative). For example, I avoid violent movies could be easily reverse coded by switching the wording to I enjoy violent movies, but the original scale does not do this for any of the questions.)

[Dandelions, tulips and orchids: evidence for the existence of low-sensitive, medium-sensitive and high-sensitive individuals - PubMed (nih.gov)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29353876/) (‚ÄúWhile we were able to identify a highly sensitive (orchids, 31%) and a low-sensitive group (dandelions, 29%), we also detected a third group (40%) characterised by medium sensitivity, which we refer to as tulips in keeping with the flower metaphor.‚Äù ‚Äúthe three groups differed in neuroticism, extraversion and emotional reactivity to positive mood induction with orchids scoring significantly higher in neuroticism and emotional reactivity and lower in extraversion than the other two groups (dandelions also differed significantly from tulips).‚Äù ‚Äú**Findings suggest that environmental sensitivity is a continuous and normally distributed trait** but that people fall into three distinct sensitive groups along a sensitivity continuum.‚Äù)

[Sensory Processing Sensitivity and its association with personality traits and affect: A meta-analysis - ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0092656619300583) (‚ÄúSPS in children correlated with Neuroticism (*r‚ÄØ=*‚ÄØ0.42) but did not with Extraversion, Openness, Agreeableness or Conscientiousness. In adults, SPS correlated with Openness (*r‚ÄØ=*‚ÄØ0.14) and Neuroticism (*r‚ÄØ=*‚ÄØ0.40) but did not with Extraversion, Agreeableness or Conscientiousness.‚Äù Again, like the previous study the full text of this study is sadly unavailable for free.)

[The Role of Attachment Insecurity and Big Five Traits on Sensory Processing Sensitivity - PubMed (nih.gov)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30321115/) (‚ÄúAttachment avoidance, but not attachment anxiety, moderated the effect of BIS activity on SPS indicating that, compared to those with high BIS sensitivity, those with low levels of both BIS and attachment avoidance reported lower level of SPS.

ESTJ,"My ESTJ friend has a lot of good qualities. Very high standards but I see how his stubbornness to do things only the way he wants/sees the solution is also causing some problems. 

He is terrible with delegation because he complains about the lack of standards if he gives up control. Which to the parties he delegates to it leaves them uninspired and to be honest, has the opposite effect on their work ethic. 

Think about a parent you want to please and you try and only receive criticism or the task is taken from you instead of you given instruction. 

ESTJ would say he can‚Äôt find good help (he runs his own biz) but I see these as connected, the never ending cycle of him being worn out and stressed and yet not being able to know how to train someone properly because that does take some ‚Äúsoft skills‚Äù to develop.

 I‚Äôve told him he won‚Äôt find someone who is as good as he is (otherwise they would start their own same biz!!) that he has to be realistic about his standards.  

I‚Äôm not sure if ESTJ does realize this is connected but his stress levels have him also on a short fuse with others - I know for certain he regrets an argument with his friend that caused a riff. I don‚Äôt think that would have occurred if he was more relaxed. 

I guess my question is: 

Is there anything I can do or say that will help me build credibility with him if I mention these things? I don‚Äôt want to give unsolicited advice but he often will rant a bit about all this. I run my own business too and I had to learn to give up control for my sanity. I listen and usually try to distract him into relaxation lol but how best to approach suggestions?

ESTJ,"Hi I've tried doing research on my own and still can't tell which type I am so I'm hoping someone on here can give me some help. (Sorry in advance for the long read). I always thought I was ESTJ because especially when I was younger I was more socially extroverted. Now that I'm older and I know a lot more about mbti and cognitive functions I realized that social extroversion does not dictate type. I relate a lot to both ISTJ and ESTJ characters, memes etc. I have taken several cognitive function tests and the results just confused me further. Every time I get very high Te and Si (within a point or two of each other) and then lower down Fi and Ne usually also very close with slightly higher Fe on a few of the tests. Since my lower two functions are obviously less clear and not as developed I find it difficult to tell whether my Fi or Ne is actually more used. A brief description: I was very very outgoing as a child but have become much more withdrawn as I've gotten older and often just want to be left alone but I am fine with being constantly around 1 or 2 people close to me (I am very very chatty around friends and coworkers though). I have been in management positions at work and really enjoyed being promoted mostly because I liked that I was trusted enough to receive the position and did everything I could to be a kind, fair mentor to my subordinates. I am also fine with not being in change as long as the people above me are doing their job well or I feel the need to step up and do things correctly. I would not consider myself particularly creative but I do have a very random, goofy sense of humor (Ne maybe?) and have no issue revamping things at work if they are not working well or don't make sense but otherwise would not typically incite any kind of change. I was involved in a situation with a coworker where she was a good person and my friend but always was breaking rules and getting in trouble on the job but because of this a lot of people essentially started bullying her and I didn't like that because it was uncalled for and mean so I ended up getting some flack from coworkers for defending her and told my boss ""I'm sorry I don't care if everyone hates me but I'm not going to bully someone unnecessarily just because everyone else is"" (Fi?). I am typically very blunt and insensitive but I only stick my nose in or get controlling with people very close to me otherwise I don't really care what people are doing with their lives. It is important to me to be liked and I would love to be part of a respected organization on a team but not at the expense of compromising who I am or what is important to me. I guess I just struggle to recognize what Ne looks like for ESTJs and ISTJs to see when I'm using it. Also obviously both types us Fi but I can't tell if I'm using it the way an ESTJ would or an ISTJ would and how to tell the difference. Enneagram is 1w2 163 for sure if that helps.

I possess a lot of both Fe and Te, only off by a minuscule amount, same with my ti and fi

So I find a lot of people will ask me about how I work with others in group/ lead and well, I love to be a leader and prides in being a fair one, I tend to look after how everyone feels AND thinks before taking on a decision. However in extreme desperation or if it is completely necessary, I may drop some emotional sides to reach the final goal, though will feel bad about it afterwards.

In person to person private type of things are a bit different, I am more emotionally driven and supportive and appear more Fe like.

He got help and that‚Äôs when the apology came. I accepted it as it was long ago we were together. I was over it. but yeah, water under the bridge. No worries.

ESTJ,"Hello all, I‚Äôm one ENFJ girl and had been dating a ESTJ guy for half a year. I‚Äôm a teacher and my ex is a law student at his last year of study. 

We‚Äôd been all good. Never really fought and we share very similar personalities. However, my ESTJ ex wanted to break up last month because he felt like he couldn‚Äôt handle the stress from his studies and our relationship at the same time. He had a strong sense of responsibility for a relationship, and not being able to fulfil the expectation and duty he gave himself, due to his busy schedule and stuff, stressed him a lot. 

After trying once more in January, he called it off yesterday on phone. I went to see him near his apartment last night. He acted loving as if we were still dating. He still likes me but he doesn‚Äôt want me to wait for him to finish his study as that makes him feel like he is not treating me well. He admitted dating me had been very happy but he could only let go because he really couldn‚Äôt handle the stress. The only thing he wants now is to focus on his last year of study. 

I think this breakup is not our problem, but the current condition (his studies) is now allowing us to enjoy this relationship. So I respect his decision. 
He agreed on keeping in touch and occasionally meeting up. So my questions are:

1. Do ESTJs usually give a past relationship another chance when the condition allows? 
2. In this case, my ex isn‚Äôt calling it off because he doesn‚Äôt like me anymore. Will ESTJs keep the affection for somebody without any promise made? 
3. I‚Äôm afraid he will forget about me. Is it rather easy for ESTJs to let go and move on?

Thanks for reading everyone! He will finish his studies in May or in August, depends on whether he needs to retake any subject. It‚Äôs not a long period, but it‚Äôs long enough to let go a person I guess. I currently have no practical idea on how to keep him still affectionate for me... any idea? Thank you for your help! Happy new year, have a nice day.",1613136282

ESTJ,"Hey everyone, I‚Äôm new here and to the MBTI in general. I recently had to take the Myers Briggs as a part of one of my PhD classes and found out that I‚Äôm an ESTJ. 

I was little surprised by my results, mostly because of the E. While I‚Äôm fine being around people, deep down I do love being on my own. I often find being around people exhausting, but they don‚Äôt know that for the most part. 

Anyways, I finally decided to find the MBTI community on Reddit, and after searching for ESTJ in the main MBTI subreddit, I learned that apparently people hate us lol. Granted it‚Äôs Reddit and you never know who‚Äôs behind the keyboard, so I take it all with a grain of salt. That being said, the thought that came to my mind while scrolling through the salty posts was the iconic quote ‚ÄúLions don‚Äôt lose sleep over the opinions of sheep lol.‚Äù Just being honest. At our best, ESTJ‚Äôs are dependable leaders that get shit done efficiently. No need to beat yourselves up, I could go on about this but fear that some will take this the wrong way (as arrogance instead of to be empowering for downtrodden ESTJs). Anyway, I just wanted to share my brief thoughts with you all. Keep up the good work ESTJs!",1612835635
ESTJ,"I got into mbti at 14, took a test, got ENTJ, but switched and self typed as an INTJ (social anxiety and toxic people tricked me, folks). I was into it for like two years, then became disinterested.

Well, six years later I come back to much more info about mbti. It's gone beyond just the cognitive functions, there's shadow functions, and.. all sorts of things.

I took a new type of test, supposedly one of the most accurate yet, and got something I've never considered. This will sound ridiculous. I've considered ISTJ, INFJ (barely), ENFJ (barely), obviously INTJ and ENTJ, and even ISFJ (and immediately said no way). But not ESTJ... only, that's what I got.

And it immediately clicked.

I gotta say, I always knew I had strong Te. But I didn't consider ESTJ because of the reputation of traditionalism, and me not being a traditionalist. But I've come to terms with that because we also have a strong desire to do The Right Thing‚Ñ¢Ô∏è. I don't think traditions are often objectively The Right Thing to do if they are harmful or outdated.

Anyway, hi, I'm not an XNTJ mostlikely, probably an ESTJ. Wow. Why did I overlook this type when I looked at just about every other XXXJ type?",1612459278
ESTJ,"Ryotaro Dojima MBTI ESTJ - Persona 4 MBTI Types

Dojima ESTJ - Persona 4 Myers-Briggs Types

Dojima is a ESTJ, Te dom and Si aux. And here's why fully in depth with his character up to this point.

Dojima is talkative, stern, cares a lot about efficiency, strict, cares a lot about rules and guidelines, holds onto past experiences all the time, struggles with his inner emotions and relating to others but can do it sometimes, bossy and assertive, compares and contrasts things all the time and likes to speculate sometimes and brainstorm whats going on and is fairly curious and sometimes looks at different angles with things with his tertiary Ne. Dojima is a Te dom, he cares about efficiency to a large extent and loves giving orders to people and is a bit bossy and assertive man. He's a very good man but is primarily logical and to the point with how he is. He cares a lot about rules and following what he's said and expect it in others and for others to follow the rules too. This all ties perfectly well also into his job as a police officer and detective as well, efficiency and the law are very important to him as a ESTJ hence probably he became it as a occupation in the first place. Dojima holds onto past experiences a lot with his aux Si, he's always mulling over the past mainly with you and what you did and uses his Ne to further speculate and question you on whats going on and making sure your not getting into trouble. His ter Ne is good for interrogating and asking questions and getting it out, he's a fairly curious man and likes to brainstorm multiple possibilities and new ideas when necessary and when somethings on his mind. He's always holding onto the past and comparing and contrasting things from past to present to now with his Si. He says every time there's an incident you were there nearby and it seems suspicious to him. His Si and Ne picks up on this all the time but not so much that he's a ISTJ or anything, he definitely uses Te more and cares about efficiency way more and bosses people around like his so called sidekick and tells him off on what he should be doing and doing it in a orderly efficient fashion with no complaints. Dojima also takes his job very seriously as a ESTJ and is never home unfortunately as a result which is common with many ESTJ parents and fathers out there, among other types too.

He cares a lot about how things are done in this house as he says in his dialogue and places a huge emphases on personal responsibility as a person, he also cares about these things with his inferior Fi inner values too and not just the Si aux traditions and rules he believes personally. He overall struggles a lot with Fi and struggles with feelings and emotions in general and doesn't know how he says to handle raising Nanako and left all that to her mother and the women of the family in the past, he's not the most empathetic or emotional guy out there and struggles a lot with his inner feelings and things he feels inside, but despite all that he's still is a Fi user and has strong inner feelings and values inside and values authenticity in his own way as a person and adult and ESTJ character. Overall logic and efficiency with his Te is his most useful and understood way of being that comes natural to him more so in the game and as a person. Despite all this and constant speculating over you and focusing on your past experiences and actions he gets so hung up on, Dojima cares for you and just wants you safe and to not get into trouble while your here and cares a lot about his responsibility as your new guardian and takes it very seriously. Dojima is a really good guy deep down and a very good person. 

Dojima got upset at Nanako for leaving the house without permission. ""No matter what your reason was, rules are rules. you promised me, remember?"" - Si in Dojima here. He gets very upset when she yells at him and calls him stupid and the lack of respect there with his Si and says ""Nanako, how dare you call father stupid!!"" Fe and Si are look alike functions and both care a lot about respect and social rules and mannerisms in society but in different ways of course. After he understands hearing you why they left and you took her out with you to get some picked radish for you, he says I see but then still scolds you and says its dangerous and kids shouldn't be out this late no matter what. His Te and Si is annoyed at this and has a very bossy Te tone and scold session and with his Si caring very much about the rules and following them in his house at all costs for safety and order in his home. Dojima is a really good guy but is a little uptight with how he is as a SJ and ESTJ character and father. Also Nanoko is a INFJ and I suspect thats also why Dojima has trouble raising her and understanding her. Dojima is a great ESTJ character and I wanted to highlight that in Persona 4 and how much I'm loving this game so far. Thanks for reading and see you in the next one.",1612448617

ESTJ,"Hey Everyone,

I'm an ESTJ that has used 2020 and the beginning of 2021 to understand my self both with other ESTJ's, and a ton of ""leaders"" in my industry to understand how to be an ESTJ to the best of my abilities. 

  
While on my journey, I was told to read Jocko Willink and Leif Babin's Extreme Ownership. I don't know how to phrase this as a summary to convince you to do the same. But I can see the amount of differences/results it has made in my day to day life as a leader in day to day activities at work and in my personal life.   


I recently went through a breakup, and took complete ownership of it and was able to learn from it extremely quickly, I might actually be able to get her back because of how I handled the outcome, my ego had to suffer, but that's the point of extreme ownership.

 A few days ago I had messed up with one of our clients and again, I took complete ownership and resolved it to the best of my abilities and ensure our client was happy. It's been a very eye opening experience to understand how our actions especially as natural born leaders (which I find most of us are) can delegate when we use Extreme Ownership in our day to day lives.   


One of the premises that I read I learned from is to ""Fear Failure, but don't be afraid to learn from it"" I think everyone nowadays is told to learn how to fail, I was never able to learn how to do that. It beat me up when I failed/lost I hated it. The authors do a great job of making sure you hate failure, it spoke to me, I felt understood. But I had to understand that FAILURE is my fault (even though it may have not been, it's always MY fault) Yes, I'll beat my self up over it, but if I have the power to change the outcome, I will do it and I will learn from it! 

My bosses at work have already noticed the differences this book has made for me as have people in my personal life. Anyways, this is just a recommendation, feel free to ask me some questions I'll be happy to answer them!",1612362583

He's a workaholic, and it's really hard to spend time with him. He's very controlling and constantly tries to tell me what to do. He's always trying to suppress my individuality and is usually very... insensitive when emotional topics come up. He gets angry easily and is very calloused with my mom and I. He always tells me to do productive things and do work, but I just don't want to. I don't feel comfortable being around him, because he has abused me a lot as a kid and he's very much against a lot of my values and beliefs. But I have to deal with him anyways, because we live in the same house.

He always wants me to do some work, consistently talks ill about my interests, and always wants me to spend time with others and the rest of the family. I am very introverted and don't like being around people a lot. I feel like every time I try to be logical and rational with him, say something objective. And he still is too stubborn to let it slide. I think he's an UNHEALTHY ESTJ, so what should I do when interacting with him? I don't know how to deal with unhealthy ESTJs, but I really need to figure out something now.

\- She's super controlling, tried to put up a schedule for everything for me, 30 mins phone use when I was a teen, a lot of lessons for various classes 

\- Super perfectionist, demanded I do everything the ""best to my abilities"" and passed something off that I've done that wasn't great as not putting enough effort.

\- Bulldozes over other people's emotions, struggles to understand them.

\- Extremely guilt tripping, tried to scold me on how much money she spent on me etc 

\-  Prefers logic in everything and will laugh at you if you dont support yourself with facts etc 

\- Keeps reminding me of the not so great things I've done in the past which is like reopening a wound

\- Either you do it her way, or she's gonna just opt out of the entire thing

However, on the contrary , 

\- She's super great at organizing things and making out sustainable plans amid chaos

\- She knows how to deal with people efficiently and make like the best deal

\- Extremely detail focused and will often notice when something is out of hand

\-  She says one thing, but she does another. She may say hard things but her actions often do mean well, although that doesn't fare too well with me sometimes cos I take it personally

ESTJ,"^(Another night, another statement post from yours truly. And yes, I'm going to be quite sarcastic here because honestly the whole situation just turned into a huge fucking joke.)

# Good evening to everybody who is reading this...

**... be it people from this subreddit or visitors from other subreddits where the news that ""**[**this subreddit is in flames**](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/f9jsew/fyi_restj_is_in_flames_rn/)**"" is being spread. If you're wondering what the hell going on then I'll give you a quick TL;DR:**

&amp;#x200B;

\- I applied to become a moderator of this subreddit about 2-3 days ago; yesterday the former mod accepted and invited me. She left as a moderator afterwards because she never really wanted to be a mod in the first place so I was left as the only moderator

\- The reason I applied was because of [how the subreddit looked like](https://gyazo.com/536a0af24e1afc94b14d947203ef888e). No banner, no icon, no flairs, nothing. Since people were asking for exactly these things I went ahead and took care of that. [This is how this subreddit is looking now](https://gyazo.com/314539b708d95e03c3bc615335ed8f55).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Okay, so people are being mad because you made the subreddit look like one?

No, not exactly. The reason is that I haven't again left the subreddit as a moderator. That's what the whole party is about.

Why haven't I left yet? 

Because I haven't found someone mature enough to take over the sub. I'm ready to leave, my work is done, I never intended to be top mod of this community in the first place.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;So just leave then!

It's not that easy. Here's a quick introduction into reddit moderating 101. Basically whoever is the highest ranked moderator (""top mod"" or ""head mod"") is the one with full control of the subreddit. Sure, reddit admins could theoretically remove moderators (eg: me), but that's only happening in extreme cases (illegal things). 

So if I leave, then who is supposed to have all the power over the subreddit?

&amp;#x200B;

**Who is the one that should be trusted with the power to remove posts and comments, ban people, change the design of the community etc etc etc ?**

In my opinion, and feel free to disagree with me here, it should be someone balanced, experienced, knowledgable and active with the best intentions for the community in mind.

Someone who is open to listening to different opinions, who has a sense for justice and makes decisions rationally.

&amp;#x200B;

That's who I personally would want as a moderator, not only here but in every subreddit.

I know, that description sounds an awful lot like me, but I'm not applying to be a moderator, I'm just trying to explain the dilemma that I am in.

&amp;#x200B;

Dilemma? Yes, because I've spent many hours talking to the people of this subreddit (mainly 4-5 people), and none of these creatures fit the description at all. ""Creatures? Really dude?"" Yeah, just look at what happened with this subreddit, that barely deserves to be called the work of human beings. And that's only the tip of the iceberg, the real fun begins when you take a look at the private chats I've had the pleasure to have to have. 

&amp;#x200B;

# I'm being the big asshole, that's the bottomline of this subreddit right now

But wait, what if there is more? Yes, if you look closely then you'll see that ""this sub"" basically only consists of the same about 5-6 people who keep spamming their often low quality memes and CAPSLOCK comments. The other 2.400 haven't said anything at all yet. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Fun fact:** I haven't banned or muted a single person here, both other moderators, who aren't just talking shit behind my back but also publicly talking shit about me, are still moderators (althought I'm going to remove their permissions before going to bed, just to be sure), and the only posts that I removed were 1 spam post and 1 post of somebody accusing me of having doxxed (leaked irl infos about) the moderators of r/mbti.

Which isn't true, but since even the mods of r/mbti keep saying that I feel like nobody is going to believe me on that one. [Btw the same mods that banned me and 15 other people](https://www.reddit.com/r/yayoletsgo/comments/ea190c/what_really_happened_behind_the_scenes_over_at/) about 2 months ago, but since they removed all posts and comments regarding that I think most people didn't even noticed / know about that.

&amp;#x200B;

# What is going to happen now?

~~I'm going to finish writing this post, lock the subreddit and finally go to bed.~~ I'm confident that I've found a new head moderator for this subreddit, it's an ESTJ who is an active member of this subreddit and a seemingly reasonable person. I'm going to talk a little bit with them since this is an irrevocable decision, **and then I'm going to leave again.**

Woohooo!!

Down with yayo, that ""selfish"", ""egoistic"" and ""evil dictator"". Finally this subreddit is free of his ""tyranny"" and his... and his.. ehh.. hmm.. sorry, what exactly has he done? 

;)

&amp;#x200B;

Sure, this was quite a one-sided post, but I already know that the full ""anonymous ESTJ circlejerk"" train is soon going to arrive in this station.

Take a look below into the comments and people will tell you how wrong I'm here with everything and what kind of awful person I am.

ESTJ,"u/yayoletsgo has gone to sleep, so I have time now to write up an organized post to keep you all in the loop.

Yesterday late morning, u/leavingNYCforwhere, the previous inactive moderator of r/ESTJ, put u/yayoletsgo (""Yayo"") in charge. This was after I and several other active ESTJs messaged ""NYC"" asking for information on moderation privileges. I am not sure why Yayo was put in charge, possibly because he was a mod on other subreddits. Regardless, it was done.

I saw this post and, somewhat frustrated that a non-ESTJ who didn't know us was now in charge, commented on it. We privately messaged each other and shortly thereafter, he gave me mod privileges. Then I nominated u/Salty_Namo, who also expressed interest in being a moderator.

Together, the three of us made a group chat and discussed our goals for this subreddit. I wanted it to remain self-moderating, and for our only duties as moderators to do what you guys can't - flairs, pinned discussion threads, removing posts that were clearly spam, etc.

I wanted to bring some life and interaction to this sub because of the respect I had for the few of us on here. And while we've certainly gotten a lot of attention the last 24 hours, I wouldn't say it's the *type* of attention I wanted.

Regardless, we were soon made aware of Yayo's history with subreddit moderation, though before we even found that out, we began having some problems.

As of now, my permissions have been cut back, Yayo shows no sign of ending the power trip he's currently on, and you are all angry. Rightfully so, I'm angry too.

Below are screenshots from our Reddit Chat group. I am sharing these so you can all better understand what is happening behind the scenes.

ESTJ,"Before anyone goes off on me, or before any of the new mods perma ban me, read this....look into it

I've been lurking, posting and commenting on this sub for almost 7 months now. In that time I have run into regulars here. 

Yesterday, I open my app and see some dude complaining about how crap the sub was. I agreed. Then somehow he became a mod, and overhauled the sub. Cool

&amp;#x200B;

But here is where it gets weird.....the people ""complaining"" about the previous mods, are pretty much all new accounts. 

And to make the sub seem more engaging, these new, spam accounts have been deployed. 

OO-EE is a one day old account.....wtf??

&amp;#x200B;

My Issues here

1. Transparency...lack of tbh. What the hell happened? 
2. Where are the ESTJ Moderators? Why do we have non ESTJ mods? There are PLENTY of ACTIVE ESTJs here who would have stepped up, but we get some 4 month old accounts and some lurkers who aren't even ESTJ themselves? That ruins the whole experience. What if ESTJs ran an INFP sub reddit? It would suck ass because it's not genuine. 
3. Shit Rules. This sub was civil, laid back and chill before these people shook shit up. Now we have a shit ton of rules which pretty much seem to be there to have excuses to ditch out bans
4. Shit mods. Some poor ESTJ got cussed the fuck out by one of our ""New"" mods, we aren't even a day into the change and us ESTJs are getting shit from NON ESTJ MODS. What the fuck?

I'm not here to shit on anyone, but if I see horse shit, I'm going to call it.",1582617406

ESTJ,"Hello, I am a female INFP. I was wondering if some of you have advice. 4 years ago I came out as bisexual at the age of 15. My ESTJ mom didn't take it well and denied it completely. To this day she is still in denial. She is a kind and loving person, but she doesn't always understand me. She thinks I am confused and pretty much refuses to talk about the subject. There is 1 good thing that happened recently: when I asked her to refer to my potential partners as partners instead of just boyfriends, she actually listened (!!) and uses a neutral word. But she is still very uncomfortable. For instance, one day she said: ""When you get a boyfriend-.."" I said:""Or a girlfriend."" She said:""No, no."" And started denying, just when I was thinking that there was progress. Do you have any advice on changing/opening her mind? How can I explain to her that this is a part of who I am? She seems to think that she knows me better than I know myself.

Additional information that may be of help:
-She is catholic
-I have only had a boyfriend, never a girlfriend

ESTJ,"**Hello everybody, I'm yayo, the new moderator of this subreddit.**

Quick introduction to me: I'm an ENTP, in my early 20s, have been active in the MBTI community for about a year and if you're into memes you probably have seen few that I created already. I mod several other MBTI related subreddits (eg r/mbtimemes) and used to mod r/mbti, too. 

&amp;#x200B;

Few hours ago I was given moderator permissions for this subreddit and since then have done some changes. Here's a quick list:

\- added a desktop + mobile Banner and Icon (do you like it?)

\- added colourful &amp; editable Post and User flairs

\- added a description and lists for recommended subreddits 

\- added some basic rules (working on them right now)

\- removed (past) spam posts / comments

&amp;#x200B;

These were the main points I saw in the recents posts / comments regarding the moderation of this subreddit. I hope you guys like the new style (if not let me know) and want to thank u/leavingNYCforwhere (the former mod) for giving me this opportunity and am looking forward to what the future brings. :)

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone else feel this way?",1582227680
ESTJ,I‚Äôm honestly clueless,1582137559
ESTJ,"**1. What drives you in life? What do you look for?**

I'm driven by time and money. I look for the quickest and easiest way to get what I want because I hate wasting time, so I cut corners. I also hate spending money and save as much as I can. I look for control over all my circumstances by making plans to control how my life will be in the present and future as much as possible.

**2. What do you hope to accomplish in your life?**

I hope to live a long, happy life free of health problems or financial struggles. My dream is to be rich with minimal stress and lots of free time. In terms of career, I desire total control and freedom to do whatever I please. My current plan is to become a professor because I can work with no supervision, flexible hours, and cancel classes whenever I want. I want to be my own boss.

**3. What do you hope to avoid doing or being? What values are important to you?**

I hope to avoid being poor, in bad health condition, and wasting time because I want a life free of problems. I value money and time. I have high savings, lots of free time to relax, and decent health, so I want to keep things that way.

**4. What are your biggest fears (not including phobias)? Why?**

I fear dying and health problems because life is short, and I never want it to end. I also fear struggling financially and having no control over the situations I‚Äôm in. This includes but isn‚Äôt limited to being framed and going to jail, living on the streets, being murdered, having my home broken into, and basically anything that puts me at harm.

**5. How do you want others to see you? How do you see yourself?**

I want people to see me smart, tough, and rich. I see myself as smart, efficient, and tough. I‚Äôm not someone who puts up with disrespect because I‚Äôll always stand up for myself.

**6. What makes you feel your best? What makes you feel your worst?**

I feel at my best when I‚Äôve stood up for myself and when I‚Äôve achieved all my goals. I feel great when my paycheck comes in and I see my bank account increase. I feel my worst when I can‚Äôt control my fate, don‚Äôt achieve my goals, and feel stupid.

**7. Describe how you experience each of: a) anger; b) shame; c) anxiety.**

a) I have a big temper and can hardly go a week without getting mad. The tiniest things can anger me, but I despise when people disrespect me or think they can take advantage of me. I can be very confrontational and am not afraid of conflict when necessary. When I‚Äôm mad, I express it to friends and sometimes hit objects.

b) I used to be embarrassed for not having any dating experience since many my age have already been in a relationship. I don‚Äôt care to date; I just think others won‚Äôt consider me as a potential partner since I‚Äôve heard some people saying no experience is a big no. This was a short phase in my life though (I‚Äôm 19). I‚Äôm perfectly fine being single right now and don‚Äôt care much about my dating life.

c) I feel anxious when it comes to the unknown future because I can‚Äôt control it and don‚Äôt know what to expect. Thinking about death gets me anxious because life is precious but can end at any second. Any health problem gets me anxious since it goes hand in hand with death. I‚Äôm the type to research my symptoms and see the doctor immediately to try to solve my problem.

**8. Describe how you respond to each of: a) stress; b) unexpected change; c) conflict.**

a) When I‚Äôm stressed, I can‚Äôt help but get mad. I relieve it by venting and often end up throwing a tantrum. I don‚Äôt get stressed by most things besides school and work. Sometimes I punch and kick things or even rage cry when I‚Äôm forced to keep my anger in.

b) Unexpected change makes me anxious because I don‚Äôt know how things will play out and have no control over what‚Äôs going to happen. I try to forecast the future so I know what to expect.

c) I don‚Äôt seek out conflict for no reason and prefer not to be hated, but I have no problem speaking up for myself or ending up hated by if conflict results in haters. I‚Äôve been called blunt and intimidating by friends, but I wasn‚Äôt aware I come across that way. I usually speak my mind in a polite way unless I know someone will have a problem with the truth because I see no point in telling the truth just for someone to get mad. However, if someone is disrespecting me, I‚Äôll go off and won‚Äôt back down at all. I‚Äôll come at them 10 times harder than they come at me.

**9. Describe your orientation to: a) authority; b) power. How do you respond to these?**

a) I‚Äôve stood up to an authority figure before because he disrespected me by throwing insults passive aggressively. I think those in authority abuse their power too much, so I dislike them.

b) I like power and being in control, but I don‚Äôt need to assert power over others. People can do whatever they want as long as it doesn‚Äôt affect me. I don‚Äôt like when others have power and control over me unless I know they‚Äôre in a position to be and aren‚Äôt abusing it, such as being the group leader if they‚Äôre more knowledgeable on a subject than I am.

**10. What is your overall outlook on life and humanity?**

I love life and never want it to end because it‚Äôs precious, but I think humanity is gross. I come across many horrible people daily; people piss me off all the time, and I have low expectations of most people.

**11. Comment on your relationship with trust.**

I used to be a very gullible person when I was young and even got scammed by people, but my cousin is a suspicious person who taught me to not be trusting, so now I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm neither trusting or gullible.

**12. List some of the traits you: a) like; b) dislike most about yourself.**

a) I like that I‚Äôm confrontational, confident, don‚Äôt care about fitting in or others‚Äô opinions (aside from not trying to look embarrassing), tough-minded, smart, efficient, goal-oriented, and good with money

b) I dislike having a big temper, having a negative outlook on things and complaining about them, and having a bad sense of humor.

**13. What do you see or notice in others that most people don't?**

I‚Äôm good at noticing other people‚Äôs flaws and focus on flaws over positive traits people have. A lot of friends have disagreed with me on what negative personality traits they see in our mutual friends.

**14. If a stranger insults you, how do you respond/feel? What if they compliment you?**

I would get mad and immediately insult the stranger back even more than they did. I think people deserve to be put in their place and I wouldn‚Äôt feel bad making super personal attacks because they deserve it. I don‚Äôt go easy on people and don‚Äôt believe in mercy for horrible people. I love receiving compliments, so it will boost my confidence and I will thank the person. I can sometimes brag about compliments I receive.

**15. What's something you are: a) thankful you have; b) wish you could have? Why?**

a) I'm not exactly thankful for anything, but I‚Äôm glad I have a job related to my major, a place to live in, and good health because these are all related to survival.

b) My biggest wish is impossible, but I want to be immortal and forever young so that life will never end. Realistically, I wish I for more money because I think life would be much easier. I wish to be the epitome of arrogance because I‚Äôll never have any moments of insecurity or embarrassment.",1582001864
ESTJ,"I am an INTP female,  and my partner is an ESTJ male, based on both of our assessments on his type. 

We're a fairly new relationship. I was just curious if there would be any problems we'd run into due to the differing functions. I.e problems w/ communication, space etc. And how they'd manifest themselves. 

Our relationship has been fine for the duration we've been together. No issues. I'm just curious if there's anything to think about/prepare for.

ESTJ,"So I‚Äôm totally crushing on an ESTJ male, he‚Äôs 20 years old for reference. I‚Äôm in a class with him and I remember asking a while ago how I can show him I‚Äôm interested and someone said to suggest studying with him, but literally 20 minutes before I was gonna text him and ask him HE asked ME. I didn‚Äôt think anything but coincidence of it, but then the next day when we met up we were sharing a google doc and he kept putting the rants he felt towards every question in it and making sure I read them before deleting them (he hates our professor, an ESFP who doesn‚Äôt give correct info ever lol). I thought that was super cute but didn‚Äôt think anything of it. 

Then last night at work, I was asked to help him close dishes and so of course I was excited! He hates dishes and his throat was hurting, so he was a little peeved at the kitchen manager. Our mutual friend asked me to HUG him to make him feel better (I‚Äôm not that bold!) but when I told him I was helping him, he went ‚ÄúOkay! Thanks!‚Äù Slightly excited. (Notice I say slightly.) He was quiet for the most part cause his throat and whatnot, but by the time we were done he was talking normally again. When we finished and I was taking off my wet apron, our kitchen manager was listing off the 2 finishing jobs that needed to be completed before we could all clock out, and my crush said ‚Äúyeah, we got dishes done quickly because [insert my name] is the best and always does a great job!‚Äù And he smiled at me like super proudly. My face Flushed at the compliment and I thanked him and smiled back. 

I‚Äôm 100% overthinking this, but I wanted to reply with something other than ‚Äúthanks!‚Äù So I texted him later last night and said ‚ÄúYo! I like closing dishes with you. It‚Äôs fun and even if your throat hurts and you aren‚Äôt talking as much, I like spending time with you cause you‚Äôre a calming presence in the chaos that is our job :)‚Äù And he still hasn‚Äôt responded (it‚Äôs 1pm the next day, 13 hours after I sent it). 

Did I scare him off? I‚Äôm so nervous that I made everything awkward.",1581876148

ESTJ,"Hi, I hoped to get some help from other ESTJs. 
PS. this is very long!

I'm not sure if my friend is worth fighting for.

In 16 personalities they describe ESTJ friendship like this:
-Friendships with the ESTJ type are often defined by their mutual activities and routines, by external factors, more so than the sense of intellectual or mystical compatibility that many Analyst and Diplomat personalities share among themselves.¬†
-ESTJs seek strong friendships founded on trust and loyalty (though loyalty to family does come first).
-ESTJs‚Äô challenge in friendship isn‚Äôt about finding fun things to do or people to do them with, but in finding diversity in their friends and activities. For all their community participation, ESTJs struggle immensely in even fully listening to differing opinions, let alone befriending people who consistently express alternate viewpoints.¬†
This is exactly how i see our friendship.Of course other values and descriptions I see in her as well, but these three description couldn't be more precise.

I am an ISFJ and in the past 6 months I've worked a lot on self-improvement. I realize that spending time with my friend is not as beautiful and amazing as i thought it was back when we younger (13yrs --&gt; now). One of the reasons why we became friends is because we had the same sense of childish humor, we would do activities together and have a blast. Now we're in our 20s, nothing has changed and I have found out how much I value communication skills. We never have a back and forth conversation I see as valubal. She never elaborates on her statements. I believe the reason is because she doesn't know the answer herself. She can understand basic feelings and the difference between right and wrong, but never go in depth and ask herself why do I think as she does. She is lacking to see the bigger picture, is very close minded and can't see others perspective.
Because I'm an ISFJ I have a tendency to shy away from conflict, but I can't take it anymore.
She calls me her ""best friends"" but for me we are hardly friends at all anymore. I've made it easy for her to call me her best friend: I give in when she wants it her way, never bothers to argue and is always there when she needs me. Im always up for anything.
On my side...
She always have to check her plans and then see if we can hang out, as if she never have an opinion on her own. Family comes first and I'm second choice. She loves to write a whole lot of lovely bullshit of how much I mean to her when we aren't together. She tells me all the fun stuff we are going to do (that we never do)...
I confronted her about the last thing last week (over text and later over the phone). She didn't like what I said and blamed it on her mother. She laterasks me if I want to come to a family dinner this weekend and if we should travel together some place in the spring or/and summer. I tell her that the vacation is a bit far ahead and hence to what we are talking about. Her argument was that if we book plain tickets its going to happen...Of course when we hang out she doesn't even bring the plans up and it's like being with a naiv child again...

But now I have had enough. I don't know if this is worth fighting for. I'm so close to just cut off our friendship. Our personalities collides in a bad way. Is she an unhealthy ESTJ?
Do any of you ESTJs have any close friendships with ISFJs? I need a good way to tell her how I feel without her thinking I hate her. Because I don't, I want this friendship to work and help her as a person as well.",1581714688

ESTJ,"Yo ESTJs! I need someone to help me out with typing someone (60 yo parent (f)) - likely some sort of an ESXJ.

Posted a type-her post and got x1 intj, x2 estj. After re-evaluating I (f) realized I was too biased and didn't really highlight her nicer traits which would likely push her into the ESFJ territory. The biggest problem is to distinquish what is a mask and what is her real self, and what is just what only I can see (because I am not very outwardly emotional, so it would make a sense I'd see someone as a T assuming they'd silently adjust without me noticing). My Fx is in Narnia so this is extremely hard for me to see her traits objectively for what they are.

Idk if you wanna bother with my long-ass (but beautifully organized, pls \o/ ) [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MbtiTypeMe/comments/eyv7j6/long_having_trouble_typing_this_person_likely/), these are some traits that might distinquish F/T in her:

* (socionics) **Supervisor** relation towards me: reminds me of details and things to do _all the time_ repetitively (no, I don't have problem with details nor not remembering what to do next nor with preparation - but from her PoV I do because I don't do it 2 weeks ahead and it drains me so bad /o\ )

* She strongly tries to prevent people from potentially making **mistakes** or might try to make them overly **comfortable** (one thing I don't do with her around: packing my luggages if I don't wanna leave with 2 more of ""what if"" lol). She innately does things for people she cares about (when sick or just generally helping out), she basically says ""she must do it"" (even if you don't want/need it). If you do something new and it yields bad results she will punish you with it yeeears after, dangerous - and she will talk you into not doing something that is connected to that old mishap, she might get pretty angry if you ignore that knowledge.

* She comes strong to me with her ""**this is what you should do**"" (based of objective values I guess?) without asking for an opinion (I suppose that smells like Te?). I often feel very powerleless around her when it comes to being my own person - everything gets criticized, everything is wrong, no opportunity to make mistakes, no space to think for myself (it's not that I can't, but she's extremely overprotective and picking up on my effs up - which I see as a learning experience). It's impossible for me to assert against her because she doesn't take a no as a no about what I want. I am more of an opportunist and it gives her anxiety or something, idk.

* Loves gossip, bases her **worth on appearance/image** - she enjoys it when ""some student crashed from stress and she got to calm down their nerves, and then they come to her office to bring her gifts as a thanks"". She enjoys it when people praise her office deco or her looks.

* Her bf LOVES **pranking** her by faking something as a fact (""You didn't know it may cause...? / Yes, this truly mysterious thing has _indeed_ happened, ..."") because she always buys into it LOL. I guess this is some blind spot of hers, idk what it is.

* She claims to have **high EQ/empathy** but I don't see it (= her behaviour strictly towards me is kinda blunt/honest *when* she's not satisfied (note: I am kinda depressed/avoidant rn, so yeah) =&gt; my mind on it = she's lying to herself / ""fake"" / mean), but it's true that she's super nice with colleagues and strangers, e. g. she (as a secretary) was persuading this teacher to ""leave this matter to her and go and rest in the meanwhile"". She's using this very persuasive friendly caring tone, she says she knows how to deal with cholerics etc. (bosses), I think she's really good with people (strangers) - unlike me lol. The mask problem is that she's certainly not trying to act nice around me when I am distraught (except that I don't show it sooo... yeah she can't know, oops), therefore I arrive at my judgement of ""wow she's only acting around them cuz of the image, I know her real self"" (but what is considered real or false at all, gawd).

* She can be pretty impulsive/scary when we **trigger** her (usually with physical **chaos** or P tendencies) and she never means/acts on it (""I'm leaving / breaking up / leaving my job and moving towns"") - the hidden connotation probably is ""I no longer will care for you all (cuz you don't listen / don't appreciate me / don't respect me)"" maybe. It's VERY dangerous to try talking back to her during such time /o\ , we all just quietly wait for it to pass. She often goes on a walk, tidies up everything or buys some clothing to get back into a good mood.

Idk, I don't feel like any of this is much telling. I find distinquishing this problematic. What should I ask myself if I wanna see her pref for F or T? How is ESXJ F vs. T going to differ when they get mad, what are their trigger points?",1580941775

ESTJ,"Over the last couple of months, I've been told on multiple occasions in a variety of situations that I lack enthusiasm. 

One was in a professional speaking class that I took, which I've taken public speaking twice before and I've never been told this. 

The next was in a sales role play I did for another class. Again, one of my docked points was that I lack enthusiasm. 

Then, a few weeks back I did a phone interview. It was somewhat of a screening. Well, the next day I am rejected and my criticisms were that I lacked enthusiasm. 

I am starting to break. I can't explain it, but it is destroying my self-confidence. I feel extremely fragile and it's causing me to shut down which is not helping. 

I'm a double major in Marketing and Selling and I was excited to have a people facing position, because I LOVE working with people, and now I feel like I just wasted the last 4 years of my life because I'm just not happy enough for my line of work. 

What are these people talking about when they say I lack enthusiasm. Because I consider myself to be hella passionate about my work. 

Where can I find work where people don't expect me to be bouncing off the fucking walls smiling 24/7. It kinda also pisses me off because as a female I feel as if they are more critical about this aspect than if I were a man. 

I just wanna add that I'm 28 and I've spent 5 years traveling the country working multiple jobs in multiple states and I had a people facing position at a gym where I outsold everyone and had the best undercover tours with secret shoppers.

He said he tested me and I failed (he is 29). After I returned we continued to meet every other day and nothing seemed to have change in our interactions apart from no more kissing. We cuddle, link arms etc though.

I asked if we were now definitively just friends and he said yes, but he has still planned trips for us in the next couple of months and we are still meeting regularly.

Is this normal for an ESTJ? I have taken him at his word but it seems strange to keep such close proximity if he has no romantic interest. (We‚Äôve only known each other for a month so there is no long history) I am an ENFP by the way  (we also talk everyday)",1580478611
ESTJ,"Hi

I think my boyfriend's mother might be an estj, I'm unsure though so I would love some help. I'm infp myself but I'm really struggling with her personality. I try hard to understand others as best I can and then that helps me be less anxious about interacting with them

I'll list some bits below hopefully someone can help.

-not sure if extrovert or introvert, can seem both
-is blunt, seems loud sometimes but not at other times
-likes plans , is obsessed with what time things are,hates their plans being disrupted
- seems productive and organised but also messy at other times. Ocd
-seems unemotional but then has emotional outbursts
-seems bossy and controlling, likes to be in control of external environment
-talks more about what people are doing, like a big house someone has, but seems day dreamy other times
- not very conversational, more a get to the point type, doesn't like small talk or long conversations
- duty seems important seems to like to help people but seems scattered and likes to have plans then changes them
-seems very unsettling at times. Needs lots of attention, always has to be about them. But then seems very private also. Often goes off for alone time.
- seems emotional underneath, is very much about family but keeps everyone else at arms length even family sometimes
-will come up with ideas, like how to move furniture around and what it will look like and could do this and do that
-doesn't seem that logical, it seems that way at first but not really
-argumentative
- seems to get bored and likes to stir up trouble and unsettle people
-can be snappy and snap people off and seems rude
- I don't see the thing of advocating for others, like when you see Meghan make clearly is able to advocate for others, is this extroverted thinking?
-when asked about something, gets very defensive and argumentative, like I never said that, I never did that when clearly they did.
-talks about day to day stuff like how much washing theyve done, how many different brands of vacuum cleaner they have, about how big other people's houses are. This baffles me but is this a sensor?


If I think of any more ill edit to add. I'm infp myself and boyfriend is esfj as far as I can tell. I was thinking an E type but could just as well be an I type.  Kinda reminds me a bit of  a bit of boyfriends esfj and a bit of an istj ex and an intj I know but I cannot work it out.

I was thinking she's estj but I'm unsure

 I think they're either a 1 or a 7 on ennegram if that helps

Thanks for any help.",1580474485
ESTJ,"How have most of you got your typing from? It's been said from multiple sources like Objective Personality, CS Joseph, that the mbti test isn't accurate, and that it's extremely hard to type oneself as we're extremely biased.

ESTJ,"As described in the title, he is very routine and regular in his contact with me. We've met about 5 times in person together over the course of 2 months (a month of the two, he was away for a business trip), but we are both very busy with work so it gets hard to hang out sometimes.

I love how he keeps in touch so regularly and I take that as a sign of good romantic interest. But how can I tell if I am just his ""talking buddy or one of many potentials"" vs. he wants to take this to another level - e.g. relationship?",1580013589
ESTJ,"Hi, so for the longest time, I typed myself as an ISTJ; however, some people I know from online (have chatted with them a lot and such) have said that I may actually be an ESTJ, just not that stereotypical. So, I decided to do some research on the type a bit more, and I noticed that I had some similarities. So, I decided to check this subreddit here to see what your guys' thoughts are on this. So, first, I'll post an older type me post that you guys can read through. Several people came to the conclusion that I was an ISTJ through that: https://www.reddit.com/r/MbtiTypeMe/comments/cye7bm/questioning_my_type/

Now, some additional behaviors that I think I should mention:

* While I am really not that talkative or friendly to strangers, when I am with a group of known people, I can easily become talkative about more well known subjects and potentially dominate the conversation. I actually overwhelmed an introverted friend of mine once during dominating the conversation.
* Some of my unhealthier behaviors may indicate ESTJ. I may rant about a well known subject as well, even if it pointless. It feels better to channel it out. I also seem to self-doubt myself when I am more frustrated or tired. Some sites I read indicated this may be the result of inferior Fi. I also seem to have a tougher time keeping my emotions internally when I am really frustrated. The problem with this is that I do have a lot of values, which, according to said certain sites, ESTJs may have more trouble knowing or using for themselves. I always thought I had inferior Ne, which is thinking of a doomed future. Now, I still have that, but many sites mention many doomed futures, while I usually just think about one, dramatically-doomed future. Maybe I was wrong that inferior Ne is my weakness.
* I don't try to pursue leadership roles, especially in public, but in the online world (and gaming, which is a huge hobby of mine), I may try to take a leadership role if I feel like no one else is doing a good job or they are not organized for the task. Once again, taking a leadership role in real life seems very stressful.
* Another problem I have with this idea is the dominate Te. I don't feel that organized irl, or at least, I see how unorganized I can be at times. If you look at my room, it is pretty messy. Maybe I just don't care enough about it to organize it? Also, I definitely mostly for comfort in my things a good chunk of the time, over organized things. Maybe ESTJs can really be into comfort too?
* Another thing I was thinking of is the Enneagram, for those that know the system. I don't relate to type 8. I more so relate to type 1 and 5. Maybe I am an ESTJ that has that enneagram type instead, which is why there seems to be strange conflicts with the typical ESTJ versus my behavior?
* I notice that when I am curious about what someone is saying or about someone, I may interrogate them a lot to learn stuff instead of just letting it happen naturally. I also like when people ask me about my thoughts; however, most of the time, if comfortable, I will just share my opinions, whether they were asked or not.
* When I get tired or tired of people, I tend to retreat socially. I also get kinda grumpy.
*  In various MBTI tests found on the internet, I usually get ISTJ with a strong leaning towards introversion. I wonder if I am misunderstanding something about it, or I am not accounting for my really social habits in the test. I usually approach the test as if the other people are strangers rather than friends.
*  When I was younger, I was homeschooled and did not have many friends. I was a bit clingy to one friend, hoping he would talk to me. I would also destroy him in video games and I guess hurt him in the process due to some smack talk or something. The past isn't a problem anymore between us, but I thought my younger self and some of my history may help with your conclusions.
* All the other ISTJs in the group I know seem to be less social than me. It is disappointing; however, I was kinda similar when I first joined said group. Maybe I became more social in the group faster than these guys are.
* Despite what I said about being social, when it comes to feelings, I feel at a loss of what to say , and what to say to comfort. I learned a bit to say stuff like ""I am sorry to hear that,"" but it feels so fake. I know they like to hear that, and I guess it indicates that you do care for them somewhat, so I will use it I guess.

That is all I have for now. I may just be a socially-extroverted ISTJ, or instead I may be a socially-introverted ESTJ. If you guys read through this (and even the post), and have more specific questions, feel free to ask. I will try to answer them to my best ability. Thank you for going through this.",1579801756

ESTJ,"Howdy folks. My (ESTP) mother (ESTJ) became offended when I told her she reminded me of Lois (ESTJ) from Malcolm in the Middle and Claire Dunphy (ESTJ) from Modern Family. Obviously her moral character is a lot different than theirs, but I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre bad mothers, and in fact they prioritize things a lot in the same way she does and get things done in the same manner. She always said she needed a gavel when us kids were growing up, so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs lost on her that she could be authoritarian at times, and yet somehow she rejects the idea of being associated with these known ESTJs. A lot of famous ESTPs suck big time, yet I can still understand how I might be like them in mannerism, but not in moral fiber.

Anyway, I guess I was just wondering what the ESTJs thought about the portrayal of these television mothers: do they represent ESTJ mothers well?  Would you be offended if you were likened to them because of your mannerisms and not your characteristics?",1579368896

I think my ESTJ stepdad is a 3, I used to think he was a 1 because of being nitpicky, but his overall behavior seems to fall more into 3, because when he's not working he has a tendency to get really lazy like he's gone to the low side of a 9, and then he'll get mad at himself for not getting ""something"" done.

Keep in mind, all of these statements are open to interpretation please do not interpret them offensively. If you find something to be incorrect or incomplete, please comment! I am posting this with the intention of learning.

* **Underdeveloped personal values**
   * The subject tends to lean towards judging values based on Te, i.e. ""does this work/make sense logically?"" Instead of judging values based on ""how do I personally feel about this?""
   * Lack of feeling based values may cause an unbalanced ExTJ to be seen externally as offensive, uncaring, or rude.
* **Romantic relationships may be difficult/different than the ""norm""**
   * It may be difficult to keep a certain person in your heart. Romantic relationships may be based less on how you personally ""feel"" about a person. For example, the warm fuzzy feeling that hooks Fi dominant individuals to certain people/objects are not experienced to such a degree.
* Fear and anxiety sourced from not knowing how you really FEEL inside?

ESTJ,"How Does Personality Type Affect Feelings of Loneliness? 

I recently conducted some research on loneliness via a survey, and the responses I got from people blew me away. 

I knew that it was a problem, but I didn‚Äôt realize how MUCH of a problem it was until the survey blew up, got over a thousand responses overnight, and people kept messaging me asking about the results. 

As promised, I‚Äôd like to share the results of the survey for everyone to benefit from. 

Note: on this post I will be sharing the ‚ÄúPersonality Type‚Äù insights from the survey. For the non-personality type insights, read my post in another sub [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeNewFriendsHere/comments/eesy16/results_from_the_survey_about_loneliness_for_a/). 

The goal with the survey was to use the data to determine how big of a problem loneliness really is, and then eventually create a program that aims to ‚Äúcure‚Äù loneliness. 

By ‚Äúcure,‚Äù I mean take someone that struggles with loneliness at 7/10 or higher and bring that down to 3/10 or lower by improving their situation or mental state. 

The survey was quite barebones, but that was intentional. It ended up giving a ton more data than I could‚Äôve predicted. 

Here are the fascinating ‚ÄúPersonality Type vs. Loneliness‚Äù insights uncovered, thanks to all of your help: 

‚ÄúDoes Personality Type affect susceptibility to high feelings of loneliness?‚Äù Yes, it does. 

Why that is, I‚Äôm not exactly sure‚Ä¶ So let me share with you the data, and together we can talk about it. 

The LEAST LONELY personality type on average is the ESTJ, with average feelings of loneliness reported at 4.86/10. 

The MOST LONELY personality type on average is the INFP, with average feelings of loneliness reported at 6.9/10. 

Note that the ESTJ &amp; INFP do not share any similar letters- and each letter compared with each other had consistently different levels of loneliness. 

E‚Äôs average feelings of loneliness is 5.54, whereas I‚Äôs have 6.26. 

S‚Äôs average feelings of loneliness is 5.49, whereas N‚Äôs have 6.27. 
T‚Äôs average feelings of loneliness is 5.74, whereas F‚Äôs have 6.12. 

J‚Äôs average feelings of loneliness is 5.87, whereas P‚Äôs have 6.01. 

This trend held true between all other personality types. For example, the INFJ was the second most lonely personality type, at 6.8 average feelings of loneliness. 

The more INFP letters you have, the more likely you are to feel lonely, and vice versa for the ESTJ letters. 

The top three least lonely personality types are ESTJ (4.86), ESFJ (5), and ESTP (5). 

The top three most lonely personality types are INFP (6.9), INFJ (6.8), and ENFJ (6.54). 

That is all for personality type- for all other insights about this project, review the full report [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeNewFriendsHere/comments/eesy16/results_from_the_survey_about_loneliness_for_a/). 

So, what are your thoughts on this research?",1577146661
ESTJ,"Been typed as ESTP and ISTP in the past but find it hard to relate to alot of the traits and relate to a lot of the ESTJ traits. I‚Äôm 17 and male if that helps.

-I tend to feel drained and less self assured when I go for long periods without seeing my friends or family.

-Feel at my best when I am physically fit and surrounded by people who respect and support me

-Have little compassion for strangers, I view people outside of my family and friend group as idiots (I know this isn‚Äôt true)

-Cant stand it when people ramble and don‚Äôt get to the point 

-Have never had any interest in fantasy movies or books.

-Almost emotionless, I can not remember the last time I cried if I‚Äôm being honest. 

-Always been very polite and friendly to people I meet, however this can wear off as I get to know them 

-I am a very fast paced person, I speak fast, drive fast, walk fast and am generally impatient 

-Have been described by my boss as stoic, staunch and strong minded, I don‚Äôt let the emotional drama of the world interfere with my own life 

-Keep conversations and relationships impersonal and unemotional 

-I hate it when people make pathetic excuses for not working or when they try to rationalise their 
laziness.

-Have little tolerance for slow people, both physically and mentally.

-My Mom told me that I had a ‚Äúit‚Äôs my way or the highway‚Äù type of personality as a young child when playing with other children. I don‚Äôt know if this is relevant to MBTI but I found it interesting.

-While I have many friends at school and get on well with everyone, they are all surface level relationships and only have a certain few that I really click with 

-Have no interest in dating as of now. Despite having many girls in the past and present who have wanted to date me I have turned them all down. I also have a tendency to ghost females after hooking up as I no longer find them attractive. I also find it entertaining to try to get with multiple women at the same time. This happened last night with 2 different girls, 1 of which I find attractive and will most likely stay in contact in order to hook up again. It‚Äôs crazy but it‚Äôs true.

-Always have been extremely independent, I hate the idea of relying on others to help me 

-My preference in music is for high tempo, high energy songs. I really enjoy iron maiden, led zeppelin, and other rock artists. I also listen to a lot of rappers such as future, 21 savage, young thug, drake ect. While I do appreciate lyrical substance in music it is not what I listen to it for.

ESTJ,"Hello - ESTJ/ENTJ BF and I had coffee this morning, which ended with a pause in our relationship (his choice of words). 

TLRD: 
His divorce will be finalized by the end of 2019. Initiated by him. 
Has lived in own place for 1yr. 
Needs to buy new home get situated in life. 
Work has a ton of deadlines right now and he is also moving from an employee to an independent branch of his company. 

He told me today that he loves everything about me and really really has strong feelings for me but isn‚Äôt capable of giving me all of him now. 

He held me today as we talked. He said he is not ready for a serious relationship because he is not healthy. He needs time for himself to become a better person and heal. 

He said he believes I deserve the best he can give and he can‚Äôt give that to me right now. He wants to preserve what we have now by pausing vs keep going and crash because he is not healthy. What unhealthy means I don‚Äôt know.  He said he is doing this for us. 

I‚Äôm not sure if he is trying to be nice about breaking up or if he really means what he is saying. He tends to always be upfront.

There were a few times he cried and just held me. He said he is taking a big risk of letting  me go to make himself better but believes it‚Äôs worth it. 

At the very end of the convo he looked me in the eyes, hugging me and said ‚Äúwhen I come back if you‚Äôre still interested in me, I want to be your only dance partner, I don‚Äôt want you to have any others.‚Äù  Such an odd thing to bring up, he said he looked up dance lessons on Craigslist to learn and become a strong lead for me. I do love to dance. Random. 

My question is this: 

Have you seen any ESTJ/ENTJ‚Äôs come back to someone once they became healthy after pausing the relationship? I‚Äôm leaning into he is a ESTJ.

I‚Äôm absolutely heartbroken. I sent 1 message this morning and he called me this afternoon saying again he has high hopes for us in the long term.

ESTJ,"I guess I just don't know who to ask about this, so I thought I'd put some words here on the ESTJ forum, since it's about a dear friend who's an ESTJ.

she's the most hard-working person I know, first off. She's my boss, and since I met her, has been open minded (except for her silly opinions about music and such), so friendly, honest, loving, caring, and genuinely good to everyone she meets. Sure, she can get aggravated sometimes and overstep a boundary on occasion, but seriously nobodies perfect.

aaaanyway. she's also very depressed. she cries on her way to and from work every day. she's wanted to get out of her marriage for over five years, but is terrified of being alone, as well as a single mother of two kids. I think she feels trapped in her own life. have you ever felt that way? did you get out of it? She's doing so well at work that they created a position specifically for her to organize/run our whole department. when she went to everyone in her life about it, she said none of them responded with asking how she felt about it at all, their responses were only about how it would affect them - (her mom wanted more money for daycare because it was a pay raise, her husband said she'd just be working more, her sister was mad because she was passed up for a similar position, etc.). 

I just want to know how to best care for an ESTJ. I feel like she's so special and has come from honestly a kind of shitty/selfish background and just want her to know that she's worth everything and deserves to have happiness. but I don't know how to give it to her.",1576052286

I've recently noticed how good I am to say things that lifts the burden off of my friends. Especially if they're female and I am interested in pursuing them. 

I am by nature quick to arrive at conclusions based on my observations (just like any other ESTJs) and I usually find no troubling finding a solution to a problem. Sometimes, if I am not interested in helping the other person, I wouldn't say things. However, if I have a goal (help a friend out or earn the trust of someone else) I've noticed that I go above and beyond in making them feel relieved first even if that entails in me warping the truth. 

I feel guilty often because of this quality. However, its been engrained in me so much that I oftentimes don't even realize I am sugarcoating certain facts if I just met the person. Maybe its my firm belief in positive outlook leading to better outcomes, but I noticed that I change my attitude towards them as I get to know them better.

To not bore you with details I shared a secret of our relationship to a common friend of me and the girl. This made her really angry with her last message being ""bye n don't text me"". Just 30min before that went down we having a lovely talk.
What are your guys take on this sudden anger? Will she forgive me or at least give me a chance? Or is this a final goodbye?
PS: she really likes me. Just that day we were discussing what she will gift me on my birthday. It is hard to believe that she will end such a beautiful relationship that quickly.",1575595727
ESTJ,"Hi! So I‚Äôm an INFP and I think my ESTJ friend might like me. 

When I first met him 2.5 years ago, I took him at surface level. Didn‚Äôt get to know him, thought he was a jerk. 

Fast forward to this year, I‚Äôve gotten to know him and we always have a good time together. I have a metaphor to describe what it‚Äôs like talking to him but I‚Äôll explain it better in just a second. 

He is very much an ESTJ. Very organized, logical, motivated and outgoing. He‚Äôs a sweetheart. He is respectful and will hold doors for every female he‚Äôs with. He can tell pretty quickly when someone is upset and gives the warmest hugs if they need. 

Directly to me, though, whenever I feel sad or stressed about something, he is almost always the first person I want to tell because he offers the best encouragements. He says something small like ‚Äúyou got this!‚Äù Or ‚Äúyou can do it!‚Äù 

One night I was really feeling depressed and upset and I said ‚ÄúI probably have no hope for my future‚Äù just kind of as a joke, and he said ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not allowed to say that.‚Äù And I asked ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù And he said ‚Äúit‚Äôs not true.‚Äù And basically moved on to another topic. He didn‚Äôt want to talk about it anymore, which I respected. 

He listens to me whenever I‚Äôm upset and offers some great help. (Example, I was literally crying over failing a paper and he showed me quite softly how to fix the problems to improve on future papers.) 

The metaphor I wanted to explain- I‚Äôm constantly flying with my emotions in the clouds, but when I talk to him it feels like he‚Äôs metaphorically holding my hand, letting me float but not letting me get carried away. 

I guess I just wanna know, are these signs he likes me as more than a friend? Or am I in my feelings again and being dramatic?",1575474529

In the past, he‚Äôs said a lot of hurtful things about me and my worth, calling me names such as ‚Äúused furniture‚Äù or ‚Äúslut‚Äù, and the last time he said it, I warned him that if he says anything like that again, he won‚Äôt be hearing from me.

Yesterday, he said something along the lines of ‚Äúwhen you deserve a micra but want a Bentley‚Äù, I didn‚Äôt really know what he meant but it annoyed me, a lot. I never do this - EVER - but I brought his family into it and said a lot of things that essentially made him feel small in front of me.

ESTJ,No lying now; please provide supporting evidence.,1574801364
ESTJ,"Hey folks.

I'm an ESTJ and my boyfriend is an INFP.

Some things to understand about our relationship:

\- I am a female ESTJ and very turbulent. I notice that, despite being more self-assured than most of my peers, I tend to question my own behaviours and choices more frequently than the typical ESTJ. My peers would consider me ""good"" at handling their emotions. (Frankly, I think it's because human emotions are relatively predictable. I've always found people easy to read simply because they all follow patterns that, once discerned, make them easy to provide advice and solutions to.) I would also consider myself privately a very emotional person. Like most of you (I would imagine), I tend to only express my emotions when I am alone.

\- My bf is a male INFP. He really values being alone. He also once classified himself as a ""beta bitch"". He's quite emotionally distant. I don't think this distance is intentional, but I certainly think that he is uncomfortable with the prospect of opening up to people, especially people outside his very small inner circle. For an INFP, he's surprising political but still very conflict-averse. 

We've been together for a little over a month and I really enjoy his company. We acknowledge that we are complete opposites and, despite having many overlapping interests or a shared sense of humour at times, there is a very noticeable disconnect in how we function from day to day.

For example, he is very fond of spending time alone, and gets quickly drained when jumping from social event to social event within the span of a few days. I, on the other hand, enjoy his company and try to communicate my affection for his through spending time with him. I am expressive about my intentions to maintain the relationship over a long period of time... he's much more cautious with the idea of commitment. 

It appears strange to me that, especially in this combination, I am the one feeling somewhat unfulfilled at the moment. I know I have strong feelings for him. I know I want this to continue in the future. And damn, am I ever comfortable with the independence he offers me. Yet I can't help but feel as though the relationship is one-sided. I feel like I'm ready for a certain level of intimacy that he's not quite ready for yet which... it's kind of shocking that the ESTJ in this circumstance is pining for more intimacy. 

I guess what I want to know is if any of you have experienced a similar relationship (be it romantic, platonic, familial... whatever) and if it worked out in the end. Are there steps I can take to make him feel understood without infringing on his privacy? And even then, is it possible for me to understand him when our brains very evidently work at a dichotomy? 

I like him a lot, and I see a real future with him. Hell, if I didn't, I wouldn't have asked him out in the first place. But I just want to reach a balance where both of us are comfortable and fulfilled. Any and all advice is welcome.",1574694556

ESTJ,"I've posted here a few times because I am an INFJ woman (in early 30s) who always attract and get attracted to ESTJ men, both knowingly and unknowingly at initial encounters. You guys are my favorite men, given I've been in multiple relationships with you guys!

I want to run this observation I have about ESTJ men (mature ones). There seems to be two very different styles of ESTJ men...

1. The first type is your very typical manly and bro-ish ESTJ. Define themselves very heavily with concepts of brotherhood, loyalty, protection, etc. They can sometimes be quick to temper and point things out very bluntly, almost in.. like military fashion. I've been with two of this kind of ESTJs, and I had never felt more protected. They also make it very very clear they're interested in pursuing a relarionship, so I find this to be really nice and flattering. But the issue in the relationship always arose whenever I would disagree with his facts or his ways of doing things. Can be stubborn...  

2. The second type is the reeeaaally chill ESTJ men. They're smiling and easily sociable, and appear less ""strict"" with order and hierarchies. They have as many friends and bros as the first type of ESTJs above, but that sense of protection is not as strong. I've been on dates with this type of ESTJ men, and I've noticed that they are less likely to be physically advancing as the above type. They can sometimes appear as though they mold/adjust into the crowd a little more than the first type too. More accommodating, I guess.

My question for you ESTJ men is: how much of above qualities do you think are innate/natural, and how much are environmental/nurture? Which group do you relate to more, and have you always been that way?

As for the second type, are they like the first type deep inside?",1574384461

A little history:
She was my ex girlfriend when I was 14, but it barely lasted. The breakup was tough tho. So after 2 year we go into this crazy fight because I as a toxic asshole commented on one of her post ""wow what a basic bit**"". Infps are infamous for managing their suppressed emotions. 

Fast forward to when I become 18, and she approaches me (a week before this date) on insta. She apologized and then I did. However, the mistake was all mine. And after chatting for abt 4-5 hours for 2 days she approached me. And suddenly said ""do u want to go on a date?"". I said yes as I was already crushing on her but then she backtracked and said that she doesn't trusts me (becoz of the fight) and hence doesn't want to go on a date. She keeps bringing up that she doesn't trust me, even after me opening up to her completely, which respect and I am fine with.

My question is this a clear rejection on her part? She says she likes me, she talks everyday with me, we have fun exchanges? Is this a clear indication of a friend zone and a rejection that I am ignoring?

Tldr: my ex approaches me for date and then backtracks. Rejection or not? I am confused.",1573012290

Is anyone here a social learner? And learn through engaging someone else through dialogue? If for some reason I don‚Äôt engage I tend to not learn it as well or just not learn it at all. I need to be a super involved learner, is anyone else like this?

For instance in classes if I don‚Äôt speak up I a. get excessively bored and start playing with things. b. I am both kinesthetic. And social and if I don‚Äôt do either my mind either wanders off or I fall asleep rapidly. The lecturing doesn‚Äôt really help it‚Äôs like music to my ears like a lullaby or it really just seems like someone is just droning on and on.

I mean I don‚Äôt learn nothing....

He's aware that I'm driven at work, even though being an ENFP, I keep doing more than I'm asked and he knows I want to grow in the company.

I know you guys are blunt and direct, and will probably say if there is interest he'll show, but I do see some signs of care. His actions to help, his openness to solve everything, every motivation he gave me, get me scratching my head. And I'm the only one in my team, that reaches out to him, and he's even more than glad to help me with every crazy thing that comes up from work.

There are so many things about him I admire: He's ex-navy and worked incredibly hard to get where he is. I'm not a big military fan, but I understand the need for the military and the grit it takes to succeed in any military branch. He came up from nothing and isn't ashamed to let people know about his success. He's incredibly resilient. He's outgoing. He's straightforward and doesn't put on airs. He doesn't take shit from anybody. He will not let anybody (family, friends, etc.) take advantage of him. He doesn't hold grudges unless they're deserved. He's an all around decent guy. 

I LOVE that he hates office-culture culty bullshit as much as I do. He's just more willing to call it like it is in the moment. 

...but sometimes he confuses me terribly and I have a sneaking suspicion he doesn't trust/like me. When I'm talking to him, sometimes I think we're talking past each other just through misunderstanding. 

He's told me multiple times I have a lot of potential and need to take my life more seriously/not give into my emotions. He thinks I'm an under-achiever and occasionally I catch him ""testing"" my strength, if that makes sense. We don't share a ton of interests, but when we do it always makes me smile.

We‚Äôve spent some time together one-on-one, and it‚Äôs getting to the point where keeping my feelings quiet is more stressful/frustrating than the idea of outright rejection. 

I really want to say something, but given how direct ESTJ‚Äôs tend to be, is it possible that his not saying anything to me is already a rejection in itself? Should I say something anyway? Or do ESTJ‚Äôs generally prefer making the first move? 

On that note, if I make a move, how would you suggest doing it? I‚Äôm a hardcore feeler so I don‚Äôt want to get all gushy too soon if that‚Äôs a no go.",1571198438

ESTJ,"I know I should just focus on the person not their type, but I could use all the advice I can get. So around 6 months ago my close guy friend (ESTJ) asked me (INFJ) out. I really really liked him but rejected him because I was worried the great friendship we had would be ruined if we ended up breaking up. He took the rejection well and we still talk several times a week, but everytime I'm with him I can't help but wish we were dating. He now only refers to us as ""bros"" which makes me feel like he's over it. Based on what ESTJs are generally like, is there any chance he'd still be interested after all this time ihe's put in to move on? If so, how should I move forward from here?",1570983294
ESTJ,"Hi! Okay it might be many questions but I'll give some background first. Prepare for word vomit, I'm a mess.


I thought about posting in r/ESTJ as well, but there are more subscribers here and possibly ENFPs with experience banging ESTJs.


I've worked with the ESTJ for 2 years and we got along enough and got to a point where we were just 'cool' with each other. I previously just thought of him as hardworking and fun but abrasive.


About a month ago something changed? And i was curious and decided to explore what was going on and he point blank told me he was interested in me.


It's been really fun but confusing for me. Please help lol


We've made it clear to each other that this is just for fun. I don't really see this lasting because of our differences. But I see us remaining friendly.


At work, I have figured out that I need to let him work first before approaching him and being flirty. It seems like sending him flirty texts/sexting works because he can respond to it on his own time. On one hand, I really like this because I feel like I am allowed to have my own time.



1st Question:

Are male ESTJs focused on physical appearance? 

I seem to get much more sexual energy from him if I am dressed up at work vs a t-shirt/jeans and 5 days of unwashed hair lol. He especially likes when I wear my glasses, a tie, suit, or a skirt.  (My work environment is very 'relaxed-fit casual' so anything beyond that stands out.) I'll get a text first thing in the morning that I look sexy. Which is nice :)



2nd Question:

What behavior actually turns on ESTJs? &amp; What behavior turns them off?

I have read that ESTJs are into femininity and confidence. I try my best to exert feminine prowess and give the air that he is manly.



3rd Question:

Do all ESTJs 'schedule' sex? 

We've only had sex once, scheduled, this past Tuesday. We have sex scheduled again this coming Tuesday. Which is great, but...what if I want it today? Lol



4th Question:

Will he be offended if I suggest he pleasure me differently from what he is currently doing?

I tried directing him some during sex - especially oral because...good lord I have no idea what he was doing...he had talked up his oral skills. I was skeptical at first but am worried now. He seems so satisfied with himself and my orgasm that that's all there is.



5th Question:

How assertive can I be w/ an ESTJ on intitiating or flirting? 

Would he like it if I just flung him against a wall and went to town (not at work)?



6th Question:

Are ESTJs into cock worship? 

I am kind of getting that vibe. He is smaller though - I don't mind at all but how can I make it incredibly pleasurable/satisfying for him?



7th Question:

What kind of dirty talk do ESTJs like to hear? Or do they like dirty talk at all? How filthy can I sound?



8th Question:

Do ESTJs like random gifts/thoughts?

I brought him in a few donuts he liked this week and he was appreciative. I kind of want to do something again tomorrow since he will be working late but I don't know if they will feel smothered but I just want to be friendly/thoughtful.


I would like to try sex out a few more times. Ultimately i might get bored with scheduled sex but I do like my own space so who knows.


Thanks in advance for any help !",1570753910
ESTJ,"Enjoy approximately 1 hour and 20 songs of [ESTJ-ness!](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0E2WswdWZOFC5QENZY85MS?si=5JbFb7q4QoyctTaRwyKr5A) These are compiled from [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ESTJ/comments/dc4ib4/favorite_songs_for_estj_playlist/) I posted a week ago.

Apologies for being a day late.  

**Highlight Reel**

**Novelty rating:** Everything was new, surprisingly.  

**Top three songs**: I really liked **Walk On Water by Thirty Seconds to Mars, Waste A Moment by Kings of Leon, and Kamikaze by WALK THE MOON.**  

**Weirdest song**: Nothing was particularly weird about these songs, although the **Koniggratzer Marsch** was a bit unexpected.  

**Most in-character song**: **Surrender by WALK THE MOON** has that air of intense self-control that I associate with ESTJs.  

**Surprise**: Someone I knew a long time ago had the online handle of ‚Äúkingsofleon‚Äù which I assumed was some obscure historical reference. The fact that it‚Äôs actually a band name is a little disappointing, oh well.",1570663545

ESTJ,"I am currently in work contact with an ESTJ who has a habit, of going from 0 to 100, at the drop of a hat.

I would describe his anger as being one of extreme righteous indignation.

He has to my knowledge never been physically violent, but he does engage in a lot of alpha male do what I say, this is my way or not at all etc behavior when he's mad. I'm not sure if he's aware that he does it, but when he's mad it looks like he tries to intimidate the other person.

When he's mad at me for example, he'll puff his chest out, point his finger right in my face, somehow his entire skin color will turn red, and he basically looks like he's trying to square up and start a fight with me.

Which causes me to react like; -_- seriously? Is this grown ass man throwing a tantrum at me?

Now since I cannot change him I've decided to try and change myself.

So the next time he decides to engage in conflict with me, what are some useful tips for how I can moderate my own behavior?

Basically when you guys get into conflict with someone what is in your opinion the best way for them to react?


Also, I don't know if this will help or not but he is very emotionally dishonest. What I mean by that is most of the time when he's mad it's usually because someone or something hurt his feelings or basically his ego got bruised and so it's really clear that he's mad because his emotions are flaring up but he tries to cover it up and act like he's upset over a more intellectual issue.",1569532476
ESTJ,"After thinking my type had changed from ISTP to INTP, I recently was counseled that I am probably in the midst of a long Fe grip following my divorce from an ENTJ. As I (think) I am finally ready to begin dating again, I have seen that my ""ideal"" - yes oversimplifying - match is with an ESTJ.

I'm not sure I've ever been close with an ESTJ (always seems to be an ENTJ for some reason), so I'm here to find out what you all are like. How are you different from an ENTJ? It seems like you have a lot in common with all your Te, a trait I greatly admire. How are you different? I don't want a repeat of my previous relationship, obviously, so I have a few questions.

Are any of you in a relationship with an ISTP? What are the main sticking points you run into? What are your strengths together? For the female ESTJs especially, do you have trouble maintaining respect for those that tend to be aloof like we are? Frankly, the way I see it is, I'll orient you, make sure everyone is headed in the right direction, and then you can do all the bullshit Te that I can't stand. Sounds pretty ideal, but I had that in some ways and still couldn't make it work. 

I've done a lot of work on myself, am a lot more confident and comfortable with who I am, and don't expect a repeat, but I want to lay as good of a foundation for myself in the future as I can before trusting another person romantically again. Thank you for any input you may have.",1569466383

ESTJ,"I'm 19, finished school this June, and am now taking a gap year before I go to university in one year's time.

As a foreword, I loved my school. I loved the atmosphere, I loved my group of friends, and I loved the routine of an environment I knew inside out.

After finishing school I had a normal summer holiday/vacation, but since the start of September - when I would have gone back to school - I have felt a bit lost. I recently started working a 9-5 as an intern, and although I enjoy the work and the people are (genuinely) lovely, there was a level of utter familiarity I had at school that I am struggling to replace.

I have been fortunate enough to have a very steady and unchanging group of friends for a number of years now, and this weekend they all move to their respective universities. Although I do not struggle to socialise, I struggle to form new, lasting friendships. I take a lot of time to form deep relationships and as such those who have become close friends, I have almost never fallen out with, and largely remain close today.

However, due to the ultimately inevitable external factor that is leaving school and going separate ways, my friendship group is being broken up. I am - despite my frustration in my emotional lack of control in this situation - sad. 

I have always wanted to take a gap year to work for a few months and then travel. I do not question my decision, I am simply struggling to adjust to change.

&amp;#x200B;

It almost comes off like some kind of dependency issue.

&amp;#x200B;

Examples;

&amp;#x200B;

An ESTJ when I was younger literally said to me; ""Anytime you see me working your first thought should be on how to make yourself useful.""

&amp;#x200B;

Examples not involving me;

&amp;#x200B;

A friend of mine with an ESTJ dad has said that on more than one occasion he would get really ferocious because my friend would be doing something that didn't involve helping out with whatever his dad was doing.

&amp;#x200B;

ESTJ at work started doing the Te voice that voice you guys do when you're telling someone off, and it sounds like you're scolding them, anyway he started doing that voice to a younger guy over how he should've been helping him with something. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really feel like giving out every example I know of.   


I'm not taking away from the work ethic you guys have. Every ESTJ even the unhealthy ones I've met will work until they're basically dead on their feet, but it's like I'm not going to drop my business just to run over and help an ESTJ with their own.

ESTJ,"My manager, let's call him B, joined the company 2-3 months before I did. He didn't even know he was going to be put in place as a manager but the guy who hired him ended up leaving. So B got promoted by default. He needed someone to do the work he couldn't do (because it gets slightly technical and he's not good at anything involving using or knowing technology), so he hired... me. And within the first week, I knew B was incompetent. I wish I had known during the interview or I wouldn't have accepted the position. 

Anyway, after working here 5 months, doing 80-90% of our department's work while he BSes his way continuously in front of managers and directors in an effort to look managerial, I am at a point I am wondering whether my ESTJ director (let's call her D) realizes what incompetence lies under her (she inherited him and wasn't involved in B's hiring). 

I am always CC-ing D on emails, wanting to show her who's running our department's shows, attending to all our customers' needs. I work closely with B so I know his quality of work; it is severely lacking in quality and competence and I often have to try to fix his mistakes before it goes to D but at this point, I have kinda stopped caring to make B look good.

I need to know what's the best way to approach D to let her know that I just want compensation parity; I cannot let someone doing 20% of the work make more money than me. It's just not fair. Does fairness matter to ESTJs?

It's not that I want to go over B's head. I have no choice. I'm afraid D doesn't know the truth about the situation and continues thinking B is doing a great job because our department hasn't received too many complaints, since I am doing everything in the back. And hell if I will allow B to get any kind of recognition that continues to allow him being above me in position and pay.

The ESTJ community is quite thin here, compared to where I came from (r/INTJ). Hope I can get some responses from an ESTJ's perspective on how best to approach the matter; I want to know if ESTJs see injustice and are just waiting for the right time to execute due process (waiting until the proper time to fire/demote someone) or if they are oblivious unless someone directly points it out to them.",1565750885
ESTJ,"INTP here. Mid 30s.

In late 2017 I met an ESTJ guy after following him on Instagram. We struck up a conversation and communicated multiple times per day for a month. In December 2017 he passed thru my city on business, and we met up. Had an amazing evening with him.  He invited me to his hotel, and I accepted. We met up a few more times over the next month and had a few really deep conversations. It got to the point where I actually let my guard down and felt safe with him. I think he started feeling the same because he opened up to me a little as well.

I then fell head over heels for him. There were clear personality differences, but I feel like they were complementary, like ying and yang. We were both in low spirits for different reasons at the time, and while I have the natural tendency to procrastinate when under stress, he worked harder, and that motivated me. Likewise, he would tend to overwork and get burned out, so I would help him relax and slow down a little. It felt like we ""fit"" with each other, that we could be a team greater than the sum of its parts, even if we had minor personality clashes here and there.

There came a point where I was falling so hard that I started getting too attached. I went too far trying to engage him- calling too often, asking to meet up somewhere between our two cities constantly, and other general clingyness. I've never felt so attracted to someone ever in my life, by far, and my INTP lack of dating experience, even at 35, got the best of me. I was selling with the locked-up emotions of a high school boy that never learned these dating lessons back when most guys do. My overt admiration and desire to be a part of his life slowly pushed him away. The harder I worked to win him over, the more distant he became.

Ultimately, in the summer of 2018 he told me he wanted to go out separate ways, and cut off all communication, including blocking me on all social media. We had just had an argument where, long story short, he said he lost trust in me after I Googled public information about him. From my perspective, I was considering a career change to his industry, and he's highly experienced in his field. I Googled his government-issued license information as I prepared my application for a similar license. Licensee info is available in a public database, and made a comment to him about him needing to renew a certification that was about to expire. I think I thought he'd be impressed by my resourcefulness, and our mutual sense of humor was always sarcastic.

I've respected his wishes to go our separate ways since then, with two exceptions: first, 30 days or so later I saw him at an airport, but he didn't see me. We have mutual friends, and we both traveled for work a lot, so I figured I'd just write an email saying my peace about how I recognize I was pushy, and that I'm working on myself. Second time was in April 2019 when I accomplished the first major step in my career change to his field, a career I've wanted since I was a kid, but never took action to realize. I texted a picture of me at the training event with 2-3 sentences thanking him for the motivation and for being a positive force in my life even after we stopped speaking. Neither communication generated a response.

It's now been just over a year since we last spoke. I'd like to, at very least, repair the damage. I'd be thrilled if we could just be friends again. I'm not concerned with trying to be more than friends right now. Obviously I still have strong feelings for him, but I know that I can't push it. It has to come naturally if at all.

So, ESTJs of Reddit- how can I reopen the lines of communication outside of the blocked social media? I'm considering a direct phone call, or asking a mutual friend to help. Or do I suck it up and force myself to move on for good? Thoughts? Other ideas? Thanks üôè",1565714185

I am running an experimental Discord server around the idea of putting a limited number of each type together and just having discussions and interactions and seeing what happens.

He LOVES planning, but finds it difficult to deal with unforeseen circumstances. He does everything by the book, follows rules rigorously.

He can't deal with free-spirited people. He likes giving advice to people, but more on a practical, impersonal level, which phone to buy, which hotel to stay at, etc. He likes when people appreciate his advice, he has a need to be acknowledged. He likes to talk to people, has a huge network of acquaintances, real friends not so much. Sometimes he can be somewhat insensitive, he doesn't like to deal with emotional problems and is not very helpful in such cases.

There is this game, Crusader Kings 2, which is set in the medieval era and is character based. Every character has certain peculiar traits.

ESTJ,"It's comfortable to be around y'all and it's not hard to understand that your words aren't meant to hurt me- but rather, improve me or my ideas. I can feel relaxed with y'all because I know that I can trust you to take charge of things, even if I don't understand what you're doing at the moment. Also, I think it's really really cute when y'all fumble in social situations like dealing with others' emotions or being loved on. I'm sure y'all hate it but to see your face scrunch up is so cute. Also the way you deal with interpersonal issues can seem really strange to me, in the way that you'll go out of your way to do certain things out of principle even though you'd know it was a waste of your time and resources. I only wish y'all would be more willing to discuss the things that hurt your heart instead of holding it in, but maybe that's how it works best for you. Keep being awesome!

ESTJ,"I believe that the 16 types evolved not because that is best for the happiness of each individual, but because the neuro-diversity created an optimal experience for the survival of the tribe as a whole (and still does, largely).

&amp;#x200B;

This means that certain personality types may be more practical for health, power, functionality, and quality of life for the singularity of an individual, than other types.

&amp;#x200B;

Objectively, I've found the ESTJ type to express the most practical mentality in many ways, especially for those who are males, who need dominance and testosterone for their mental and physical health. Here is are a couple of [military drill sergeants basically getting their troops to act more like dominant ESTJ's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CniJKgIrpX4)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm finding that the IxxP types (and also IxFJs) are able to copy the ESTJ mentality with enough dominant exposure, to create a ""self-stabilizing emotional state"" that primes the brain to think and act like an decisive ESTJ, which creates a positive ""personality emulation loop"" that continues to run indefinitely, until the IxxP or IxFJ engages in behavior that breaks that loop.

&amp;#x200B;

When military soldiers come home, hopefully without seeing action, and they accidentally slip back into undisciplined behavior comfortably at home, some of them miss their military times and refer to it a ""the best time of their life"" and the time that they were ""the best version of themselves"", despite all of the unavoidable difficulty and hardship that they experienced while on duty.

&amp;#x200B;

This process of latching onto the ESTJ mindset is what I call ""dominance emulation"" (DE). ... And DE, for me as man, seems to be easiest at the beginning of the day, when testosterone is naturally at it's high point of the day. If the DE emotional loop is established, I hands down have a better day, with: less anxiety, less depression, less inappropriate/excessive guilt, more enjoyable human interaction, more confidence, more focus, more ability to mobilize myself in every way (physically, mentally, and emotionally).

ESTJ,"Without writing an entire epic about our relationship, I'll try to sum it up:

I crave emotional intimacy, but my ESTJ boyfriend doesn't understand what I mean. I texted him and told him about how I feel like we don't talk about anything important, how i want to bond with him, and how I'm bored, while trying to assure him that I appreciate how he's openly affectionate sometimes. I've already looked at other ESTJ stuff, and I think the best thing to do would be to just talk about things, because that itself would solve some of the issue. I've already stated that I do appreciate him, I'm trying to not get too theoretical, keeping it to concrete tasks we can do, but I also had to explain that I was upset. We're both young and while I know a bit more what I want, he's still insecure a little bit I think and hasn't had a girlfriend before. I feel like there isn't really a ""spark"" between us; I don't think he's aware (or cares) about that being present at all. Are there any quick tips or tricks that I can use to help communication? Things to avoid? I'm afraid that by telling him this he's just going to get sad, like I don't appreciate anything he does, but I'm not satisfied with no emotional stimulation. I want to frame everything in a way he would understand, but without sacrificing my outlook on things. (Aka where's the magic ""fix everything"" button?) Is talking about it even a good idea?

ESTJ," 

**Congratulations!**

You have just selected your very own ESTJ Executive unit! As our most popularly selected unit available you are sure to be pleased. In fact, satisfaction is guaranteed! If you are unsatisfied with your unit simply submit a complaint directly to your unit itself.

## Your ESTJ will come with the following accessories:

* One (1) Professionally Tailored Power Suit‚Ñ¢
* One (1) Set of lounge clothes
* One (1) formal outfit for religious and formal events
* One (1) Laptop
* Two (2) Cell phones
* One (1) Gym Membership
* One (1) Pair of smart gloves for texting
* One (1) Bluetooth headset (for talking to people while talking to people)

## Software

Your ESTJ comes pre-programmed with the following traits;

**Te:** As the dominant function, this provides your ESTJ unit with unmatched efficiency and a keen understanding of what works in a practical setting. This function provides your unit with high levels of organization and practicality as well as a blunt clarity in communication style that other units may find abrasive.

**Si:** This function provides your unit with a mental database of previously established effective methods of handing situations it has encountered before that can be recalled quickly when needed.

**Ne:**¬†This function provides your unit with a boost to creative problem solving when facing a new situation or when previously established methods are no longer effective.

**Fi:**¬†This function provides your unit with moral indignation and superiority as well as curiously strong attachment bonds to carefully selected partners. As the inferior function your ESTJ will avoid accessing this software as much as possible as it directly interferes with their default mode.

## Getting Started

There is no need for a quick-start procedure. Your ESTJ will be fully functional and activated right out of the box. In fact, there is no box because excess packaging is highly inefficient.

## Modes

Get Shit Done Mode (*default*)- When in this mode your ESTJ will complete any and all necessary tasks required for successful completion of the assigned goals. In order to activate this mode, your ESTJ will require suggestion(s) and/or idea(s) to be presented. If more than one suggestion or idea is presented your ESTJ will automatically select the most effective or efficient one and proceed to get that shit done. This mode can be intermittently active for however long is necessary to complete the project.

Do Absolutely Nothing Mode - Automatically activated after completion of a major project deadline. Your ESTJ unit will cease all productive function and instead do absolutely nothing until it is sufficiently recharged.

Oh Hell No Mode - Activated whenever someone assumes your ESTJ unit will get shit done but neither asks nor directly informs your unit. When activated your ESTJ unit will express noticeable aggravation towards the assuming person and refuse to complete the task as a matter of principle.

You‚Äôre Doing It Wrong Mode - When activated this mode has two possible outcomes; 50% chance of activating the¬†‚Äúfine, give it to me‚Äù response. In such cases your ESTJ will assume responsibility for a task which they no longer can observe another unit fail to satisfactorily complete. If this response does not activate your ESTJ will simply watch in smug amusement considering it a fitting lesson. This mode will deactivate after your unit says¬†‚ÄúI told you so‚Äù

Touchy-Feely Mode (*locked*) - Randomly activated by what is assumed to be fluctuating levels of hormones and emotions within your ESTJ unit. Also can usually be unlocked and activated by having your ESTJ unit watch an action movie with a strong emotional component (i.e. Big Hero 6)

## Relationships with Other Units

**NF:** Finds them confusing but likable. Good project partners that provide good energy to a group.

**NT:** Generally very confused by them. Sometimes Infuriating, but your ESTJ is unable to walk away from what it perceives to be a mess. Often surprised that NTs do not walk away first. Confused by their seeming inability to accept statements at face value and instead to analyze everything.

**SJ:** These units make sense to your ESTJ, who considers them to be good people provided they are willing to try something new when the old methods do not work.

**SP:** Frequently cause eye rolling in your ESTJ. Finds them fun to have around but hard to take seriously or respect. When SP units feed your ESTJ it will probably like them, but may still not respect them.

## Feeding

For optimal performance, provide your ESTJ with food on a regular basis. While it will cook for itself, cooking is seen as an interruption to getting shit done. Cooking is inefficient because you have to cook again at the next meal.

## Grooming

Your ESTJ will groom itself. No need to concern yourself there.

## Sleeping

Your ESTJ will automatically enter sleep mode when the body shuts down. Any attempt to induce sleep prior to shut down will be met with hostile resistance.

## Frequently Asked Questions

*What is my ESTJ thinking?*  
Whatever the last thing you ESTJ said was.

*What is my ESTJ feeling?*  
Neutral unless otherwise stated

*How do I plan a date for my ESTJ?*  
Come up with a detailed plan and submit it to your ESTJ. Wait for notes providing suggestions for improvement. Follow the notes.

*Why does my ESTJ have so much criticism?*  
Your ESTJ is not criticizing you - just your plans and ideas. Your ESTJ is simply trying to help you improve your ideas and plans as much as possible.

*But have you considered‚Ä¶.*  
Yes. Your ESTJ unit has already considered that. Thank you for your input.

**Again, Congratulations of your new ESTJ unit! Now go be productive!**

ESTJ,"Hi,

so.... I did MBTI and other personality tests probably a hundred times and I always end up as ENTP or correlated types. 

However I aways hated that result and while I can absolutely see how I behave like this it never felt like me. E.g. yes I debate a lot, but I  don't enjoy it. It's not for fun, I get annoyed with people and then I argue to prove a point. 

I know that I have a problem with self image / presenting something to the outside that I am really really not. My mum is an ENTP and I am kinda worried that I simply copied her behaviour to get by. 

After watching a few satirical videos I noticed that the clich√© ESTJs almost ALWAYS say what I am thinking and wish I could just say out loud without getting into trouble. 

I read a few articles about ESTJs and it sounds a lot more like the me I experience when I am centered, relaxed and not in my usual panic ""I have to fit in and don't upset people"" mode. 

However, ENTP and ESTJ are so far away from each other that I wonder if that's really possible. Or if I am just making this up. Can anxiety, depression and trauma cover up a type THAT much?",1561810656

ESTJ,"Hi, I did some test and had opinions that I could be ENTJ or ESTJ.  What do you think?

As a child I was very vivacious, but unlike my peers I was more interested in reading, in documentaries, nature ecc rather than sports and other activities.
I liked to draw, but more than creating and inventing I tended to copy.
I also played the piano, they asked me to compose a song, but even here I needed a base to start with. At school level I was doing very well.

In the Secondary school I was studying, I wanted to do well, but after a while I started to be more interested in playing football, video games and consequently school results has fallen.

I wanted to be a Doctor so I chose Scientific High School.
Even here I was quite vivacious, ready to joke, but in this case it was above all to attract attention rather than wanting to be nice. 
At school I was like that but at home I was calm and controlled. 

I didn't particularly care about going out, I only did it on Saturday night, what interested me was football so much that I had almost changed my goal and preferred to become a footballer.

I‚Äôve always been one who wanted to be at the center, to command others, very competitive and I took it a lot when I lost or when things didn't go the way I wanted, I was stubborn, sometimes arrogant, too sure of myself. 

3 times out of 5 I started the discussions or I took part in it and a few times I stopped thinking that it wasn't worth it. 
In my group I was the one who always organized everything, from going out to matches, or who wanted to play a leading role when something had to be organized.

At school I procrastinated:
I wasn't a rebel, I took all the notes, I did my homework, but I just didn't feel like studying and I did it only the day before the exam. I have always been a person who, when he was interested in something, was looking for much on the Internet, books or other sources, all that could be useful to draw conclusions.

After high school I realized that work in a Hospital isn‚Äôt for me and I preferred to study Business Administration in order to work at the administrative level, but above all to have control, make decisions and be in a senior role. 

Sometimes I imagine future scenarios and I thought about how to act to be prepared according to situations.

ESTJ,"I‚Äôll call my ESTJ friend Bill. He‚Äôs been miserable in his marriage to his homely, judgmental wife (INFJ) for about 6 of their 9 married years. 

They dated long distance for about 4 years prior, and her alcoholic father dying early in their dating was a big factor in their staying together. 

She has never worked since they‚Äôve been married despite having a law degree. 

He cheated on her in spring 2014 (or 2013?) with a one night stand that made him realize what he‚Äôs missing. He later had 2 other affairs. He drinks a LOT, especially whenever his frustration with his wife is brought up. He talks about wanting a divorce but doesn‚Äôt act on it.

He has a 4 year old son that was the result of her raping him when he was drunk. He‚Äôs never had sex with her since, nor do they share a bedroom. 

About 2 years ago he took a work assignment that sent him away from home long term. Supposedly with the goal of divorcing (they live in a state that requires 1 year of separation before filing for divorce). 
He recently took a new job and moved back into the condo with her a couple months ago but never told us (I have him on Find My Friend &amp; noticed he was at the condo late several random nights). 

My SO &amp; I have spent literal years of listening, encouraging, supporting, and probably to the point of enabling him through what we thought was help to get him psychological help to follow through with divorce &amp; live a happier life. 
He‚Äôs only 35. He has so much time left to find another woman whose company he enjoys, who he wants to have children with. He loves his son, but often refers to him in a (to me) creepy territorial way (MY son this/that), with his ego wrapped up in his son. He‚Äôs a weekend dad, though. He‚Äôs cared for the boy overnight by himself on exactly 1 occasion and couldn‚Äôt handle it. 

We haven‚Äôt spoken to him since late February - he was on a spiritual Lenten accountability journey at the time (he‚Äôs Catholic, but with a very strong bent toward self flagellation in the name of redemption. In college he became very close with a group of Presbyterians who nearly converted him). The last thing I said to him was encouraging ways to talk to a young child about divorce (knowing he was moving back to the city where his wife/son live). Then silence. For months. We would normally text nearly every day. 

Anyway, my ENTP SO &amp; I miss him but are also angry and disappointed by his dishonesty toward himself/us/his wife. 

Is there any hope of our friendship returning? Of him deciding he can do better than his current situation? Of him being honest with himself about what kind of life he wants?

I‚Äôve been pestering my SO to send him a text to break the ice... is that a bad idea? Or if he does send something, what‚Äôs the best approach? 

Thanks for reading. ~ISFP

ESTJ,"I understand that MBTI shouldn't dictate how you view your relationships. But I hear so much negativity regarding ESTJ / INFJ romantic pairing. I, for some reason, get attracted to ESTJs very easily and have been in several relationships with them. The types I find harder to find attraction to are actually ESFJs, ENTJs, etc. ESTJs also seem to get easily attracted to me, an INFJ...

Has any ESTJs had great relationships with INFJs? I'm an INFJ in early 30s.",1560670129
ESTJ,"How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.

I'm a 19 year old male. I'm a person who may seem cold at first, but is actually quite soft hearted. I tend to think a lot about what other people think of me, the way I look, the way I do things.

Is there a medical diagnosis that impact your mental/comportamental stability somehow?

No, but I'm probably more anxious than the average person.

Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?

My parents are not religious at all and neither am I. They are very caring, selfless people with strong work ethics. I was always given a lot of freedom and structure was never directly imposed on me. Despite being given a lot of freedom, I would still try to stick to a somewhat structured life: go to school, go to extracurricular activities, do homework, have fun, go to bed.

What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?

I'm a senior in high school, only 2 days are left until my last major exam. Overall, school was quite okay. I've always been a top student in nearly every subject, always had ~2-4 closer friends, but in the last years of high school I decided to cut the toxic people out of my life after tolerating them for years, which has left me with one real friend.

If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?

I would make it through a lonely weekend, but I'd feel lonely, bored most of the time. I'd spend my time doing either physical exercise or browsing the internet and then watch an episode of TV before bed. Overall, I'd feel lonely and bored.

What is your relation with movement and your surroundings? For instance do you prefer a sport or outdoors event? If an outdoors event what is it? And why? If not what type of activities do you tend to engage i?

I like outdoors sports. Football, running, beach volleyball, biking, but I also like playing similar sports indoors, for example, handball and the version of football that is played indoors. I think I have a good coordination and my 5 senses are well developed overall. I'm not clumsy.

In terms of events, I like hikes and picnics outside, I can't stand formal events(at school, for example), where you have to listen to teachers and the principal giving boring speeches.

How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?

I'd say I'm more of a realist and I never really try doing things that I think are pointless and not possible to accomplish. So, I probably don't have more ideas than I can make come true. Though, I have a vision of what I want to accomplish in let's say 10-15 years or so. Mostly major things, such as graduating university, getting a job, pursuing my career and then maybe starting a business, running a caffe or opening a minimalist clothing shop. I'd like to fill business niches that are currently open where I live. I'm planning on studying marketing/communication.

If I find something interesting on the internet, I tend to research it a lot until I'm satisfied. For example, I've been obsessed with MBTI for 4 months and spend a few hours daily researching it. It happens with interesting TV shows or topics.

I'd say I'm not really the type to invent something completely new, but rather improve something that already exists and make it seem innovative.

Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?

I think so, yes. I like controlling people, telling them how to do things, especially in a way that I think is ideal. I would not tolerate slacking and would most likely confront workers about it. It would probably be draining for me since I would be anxious both about my leadership skills and how they translate to an effectively running company.

Are you artistic?

I tend to think of creative solutions to problems, if that counts. Also, I play the ukulele and sing, I'm alright at it, but not amazing enough to ""wow"" a crowd. People who hear me sing tend to be surprised.

I like fashion, dressing well, but not ""fashionista""-esque. It's too extravagant and looks silly more often than not to me.

What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?

The past either makes me feel nostalgic for the good times or haunts me, reminds me of the bad things that happened and can happen in the future. I tend to draw inspiration from the past and think that if X happened, it can happen again. The present is here to kind of progress to the future, which I think will be better if I stay consistent and do things properly. It also scares me, because I think of a lot of things that could go wrong in the future.

How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?

I tend to help people, if their request is something that I can actually help with, otherwise I'd try to point them to another person who knows the subject at hand better and can be more of help to them. Being approached for help feels nice, because it means that the other person trusts in your judgment or abilities, thinks you're reliable.

Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?

Sometimes I want other people to be more like me(commited, realiable, consistent), so, I push my ideals on them and expect them to change for me.

How important is efficiency and productivity to you?

It's important to be efficient and not waste too much time since I'm naturally lazy and tend to think of solutions to problems that are quicker than what another person is planning on doing.

I like being productive, but if I had the choice, I'd rather have some fun(assuming that most of the major things that need to be done are completed).

How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?

I'm very good at planning, organizing things(you should check out my room and be in awe). I tend to start and finish projects in one go instead of spreading them out into smaller parts. I can wing projects, but only if I have prior knowledge that is needed.

What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?

I excel at sports, languages, writing, but struggle at maths and physics, which I deem to be a little too abstract, vague and not very consistent in their logic. I feel like I could rewrite math textbooks to be easier to understand.

What do the ""highs"" in your life look like?

Every task is completed on time, never being late to anything, keeping my commitments. Making sure that both ""must be done"" and my ""fun"" activities are well balanced.

What do the ""lows"" in your life look like?

Procrastinating projects until, let's say, 2 hours before I'm going to sleep(assuming that tomorrow is the deadline). I still make it in time, but the stress could have been avoided for sure.

Being controlled by impulses and emotions. For example, impulsively saying something that will hurt the other person just because I can no longer tolerate them.

How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you?

I'm often described as a pessimist, but I'd say that's just my realistic side speaking. I dislike people who think that everything is all about unicorns and rainbows.

In addition, I'm extremely aware of everything that is happening around me. I tend to always scan the surroundings, as If I were looking for information.

Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?

I dislike conflict and tend to compromise with people when they are saying something that I do not particularly agree with. I rarely speak what I'm truly thinking, unless they want to genuinely hear it. I usually don't have very strong opinions on most things, everything's kind of in the middle other than maybe my dislike for people with bad habits(smoking, drinking, doing drugs).

What is the ideal life, in your opinion?

Having enough stability in life to be able to have fun. I'd like a consistent job, a family, but still have enough time to be able to keep up with my hobbies, friends.

Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why would you?

I'm normally not a rule breaker and very rarely break them. That is unless they don't make sense to me and are more likely to be a hindrance rather than something that guides you and is the 100% best way to do X.",1560433977
ESTJ,"What do you guys think of the concept of gender and traits that were biologically programmed into us?

How much do you cherish your own true gender?

Are there any traits that you guys might value but find yourself lacking in?

I know that ESTJs isn't about tradition, but there's still a natural order and structure to life.  You can't defy physics, you can't change your own biology. But it may still come off differently, or perhaps by a little different within its limits.

I'm not implying anything here, I just want your views and opinions. Namely ESTJ views. So hit me up!",1560411423
ESTJ,"On the opinions about INFP thread, I mentioned how much I loved INFP characters on TV. Some people were interested but I was busy and didn't get around to it for a while. Anyway, here is my list with relevant characters and types. I also watch out for ENFP, ISFP, and ESTJ as appropriate.

Feel free to poke me on a series that I might have forgotten or should pay attention too.  


Martian Successor Nadesico - Technically, this has an INFP in Mr. Prospector, but he doesn't have enough presence or relationships in the show to make him fun. Love interest Yurika is an ENFP, which is nice. Fan favorite Ruri is ISFP. Another love interest, Ryoko, is ISFP. There might be others in the minor characters. I watch this more because of the writing which has a lot of meta deconstruction and humor. 

&amp;#x200B;

Twelve Kingdoms - The novel series was originally for this was written by an INFP, which I typed mostly by feel, themes, and writing style. The main character, Youko Nakajima and Shoryu are ESTJ while Taiki and Rakushun are INFP. Enki is ISFP which makes for a great love/hate relationship with Shoryu. Keiki is INTJ, which makes for an interesting Socionics Supervisor relationship with Youko.

&amp;#x200B;

Fantastic Children - This is probably the most obscure series here as it's out of print and not streaming. Tohma is ESTJ while Helga is INFP. The music, especially the opening and ending feel very much like they are written and performed by INFPs.

&amp;#x200B;

Now and Then, Here and There - Shu is ESTJ and Lala-Ru is INFP. This is one of the most depressing series of all time.  


Kurau Phantom Memory - Kurau and her little sister Christmas are INFP. Their dad and friend Doug are ESTJ. Kurau is one of the most action-oriented INFPs I've seen.

&amp;#x200B;

Bodacious Space Pirates - Kato Marika is ESTJ. Ririka, Misa, and Lynn / Rin are ISFP. Mami and Ai are INFP. This is one of the more positive, fun series, which I mention because a bunch of these INFP shows are extremely melancholy, hitting lots of highs and lows.

&amp;#x200B;

Turn A Gundam  - Loran is INFP while Sochie, Diana, and Kihel are ESTJ. This is my favorite Gundam by far because of Loran. The writing for the whole show seems to have taken on his spirit too.

&amp;#x200B;

My Hero Academia - Deku is ESTJ, while Ochaco is INFP. Lida is ISTJ.

&amp;#x200B;

Hunter X Hunter - Gon is ESTJ. Killua is INFP.

&amp;#x200B;

Humanity has Declined - Main character is INFP. Her grandfather and assistant are ESTJ. This has a lot of the same meta-humor that Martian Successor Nadesico does in a much different setting.

&amp;#x200B;

Orange - Kakeru is ESTJ. Naho is INFP. One of two romances I like.

&amp;#x200B;

Blue Spring Ride - Kou is ESTJ.  Futaba is INFP. This is the other romance I like.

&amp;#x200B;

Inari Kon Kon - Inari and Ukasama (fox spirit) are INFP. Toka is ESTJ. I like foxes so this gets special notice. It looks like a kid's series but is actually Seinen (adult men's genre).

&amp;#x200B;

Our Home's Fox Deity -  Noboru is ESTJ. Kugen is ISFP. Ko and Misaki are INFP. This is a kid's series, but it has foxes and INFPs, so I still enjoyed it.

&amp;#x200B;

She and Her Cat \~ Everything Flows - This is Makoto Shinkai's extremely short OAV. The girl is INFP.

&amp;#x200B;

Rising of the Shield Hero - Naofumi is ESTJ and Raphtalia is INFP. I like Filo and Melty and they seem like INFP but I haven't bothered to confirm.

&amp;#x200B;

Attack on Titan - Mikasa is INFP. Annie is ISFP. Eren is probably ESTJ.

&amp;#x200B;

Gunslinger Girl - Henrietta is INFP. Triela is ESTJ. The music is very much INFP.

&amp;#x200B;

Princess Tutu - Duck is INFP.

&amp;#x200B;

The Ancient Magus Bride - Elias is ESTJ and Chise is INFP.

&amp;#x200B;

Durarara - Celty and Shizuo are ISFP. Shinra Kishitani and Izaya Orihara are ESTJ. Maybe Mikado Ry≈´gamine too. Anri Sonohara is INFP.

&amp;#x200B;

Shadow Skill - Gau Ban is ESTJ, Elle Ragu is ISFP, and Kyuo is INFP. I watch this more for the interaction between Gau and Elle though. Kyuo isn't the greatest INFP as she doesn't have much to contribute outside of being a love interest.

&amp;#x200B;

Magic Knight Rayearth - Fuu is INFP, Hikaru is ISFP, and Ferio is ESTJ. This isn't my favorite as much as the others and Fuu isn't my favorite INFP. The first opening and Hikaru kind of make up for it and pushed me through.

&amp;#x200B;

**Anime Movies** 

Millenium Actress - Main character Chiyoko is INFP.

&amp;#x200B;

Spirited Away - Chihiro is INFP.

&amp;#x200B;

The Secret World of Arrietty - Arrietty is ENFP. Her dad is ISTJ. I think that Sho is ESTJ.

&amp;#x200B;

Whisper of the Heart -  Shizuku is INFP and Seiji is ESTJ.

&amp;#x200B;

**Not Anime**

RWBY - Main character Ruby Rose and Neo are INFPs. Big sister Yang is ESTJ. Blake is ISFP. Nora is ENFP. There are probably others for each type.

&amp;#x200B;

My Little Pony Friendship is Magic - Applejack is ESTJ, Fluttershy is INFP, Pinkie Pie is ENFP, and Rainbow Dash is ISFP.

&amp;#x200B;

Avatar the Last Airbender - Toph and Korra are ISFP. I haven't seen the Korra arc yet though.

&amp;#x200B;

**Games**

BlazBlue - Noel, Es, Lambda, Linhua (story only) and Hibiki are INFP. Celica probably is too but I don't know her very well. Makoto is ENFP. Bullet, Ragna, and Nu are ISFP. Kagura and Naoto are ESTJ.

&amp;#x200B;

Persona 3 and 4 and Arena - Fuuka, Aigis, and Yukiko are INFP. Chie is ENFP. The main characters are ISTJ. Kanji and Marie are ISFP. Keichi Tomochika and Chihiro Fushimi are social link INFP. Yushiko Nishiwaki is a social link ENFP. Labrys is ESTJ.

&amp;#x200B;

**Anime that I don't care as much about**

Gintama - Gintoki is ESTJ, Kagura is ENFP, Sarutobi Ayame is INFP, Shinpachi is ISTJ. I could bump this up to the normal anime section, but I keep on avoiding it for shows I like more. It's also too long for me.

&amp;#x200B;

Gundam Wing - Heero Yuy is ESTJ. Quartre is INFP. I think this has an ENTJ writer.  


Bleach - Rangiku is ESTJ and Orihime is INFP.",1560388713
ESTJ,"Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

I am INFP, and my work colleague, a bit like my boss, is ESTJ. Now, I kind of liked him since we met, but after more than a few months we started to communicate more comfortably, although we do have times when we are alone and I feel there is a tension, and the situation feels a bit weird. Now, for a few months, we started hanging out outside work with other persons(1,2) and also alone, when traveling for work. I kind of talk about my silly (but not really) problems at work with him and another colleague, he kind of knows my not so interesting life. Also,  there was a time he opened up about some stuff from his childhood, no drama, just real life. The thing is he has a girlfriend for 4, 5 years, and although he does not talk about her only with few exceptions, they do go to lunch together always, with very few exceptions, and also travel. The thing is he seems to always what to engage in conversation with me while with other people and everything is a bit fun, we challenge each other, but when alone, the situation gets a bit awkward. He does small gestures, so I know he likes me, as a person, but how could I be sure he really likes me? Any advice? Thanks",1560301360
ESTJ,"I realized that my number one interest in a relationship is cuddling. And I *absolutely hate* trying put on an intricate song and dance to impress a woman. I hate typical dinner dates. I hate typical dating overall. Hell, I hate eating in front of people, period.

&amp;#x200B;

I noticed that I become the best version of myself when I'm around friendly ESTJ women because they are: direct/literal, decisive, and enjoy some competitive activities. ... It's like ESTJ women speak a language that I understand -- the literal English language. If they want something, they'll tell me. If they don't like something, they'll tell me. I don't have to be concerned about what they don't say.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a hyper-thoughtful INTP with anxiety problems. When I follow typical dating advice and show up in a super dominant way while dating, I attract women who want me to wear that dominant ""mask of masculinity"" and sweep them off their feet all day long, and I simply can't do that. And don't want to do that. ... With ESTJ's, my dominance is natural and it's me automatically mirroring the ESTJ -- I don't have to force anything. The version of myself that is positively confident and masculine comes forward when I'm around them.

&amp;#x200B;

... I basically am going to write a dating profile that appeals to the maternal instinct of a woman, I hope. It would basically say:

&gt;*I love to cuddle. Cuddling is basically all I want to do. I also love camping, hiking, sports, music, fitness.*

&amp;#x200B;

And then it would also have a competitive part and a little bit of push back (being picky or hard to get) since ESTJ's hate people who are complete pushovers.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, I would close with something like:

&gt;*We don't have to be anything serious. ... For now, we can just cuddle together and watch TV, as friends.*  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;*P.S. I learned from a professional with* [*Cuddlist.com*](https://Cuddlist.com) *how to clearly communicate consent and boundaries for a safe, respectful, fun cuddling experience.*  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;*P.P.S. Tell me about yourself! :) ... What are your hobbies and interests?*

ESTJ,"i‚Äôm an ESTJ and i have really bad trust issues. it‚Äôs known that ESTJs struggle with expressing emotion, but i struggle with opening up to people and telling them things about myself as well (but i am very extroverted). it‚Äôs also hard for me to trust people enough to delegate tasks. i also am pretty paranoid that my loved ones will betray me. 

i was wondering if this might have any connection to mbti, or if it‚Äôs just a ‚Äúme‚Äù thing, relating to past events or my personal thought process. do any other ESTJs have trust issues, or thoughts on this? this could be a long shot and of course no guaranteed connection, but there could be a pattern. 

and if anyone knows Enneagram, i‚Äôm a 8w7. i read that many ESTJs are type 8, and it‚Äôs known that type 8s are prone to having trust issues. since there‚Äôs a connection between Enneagram and MBTI, i‚Äôm thinking there could be a connection between this aspect and MBTI as well.",1560036358

ESTJ,"""What would you do"" questions:

\---

Ex 1) 

If someone tells me ""Hey, grab that cup."" I will without thinking about it.

My husband would, however, question ""why"" before ever picking the glass up. 

With simple things, I just do what I'm told basically. I can see it being somewhat ""passive,"" but I also see it as being helpful? Or wanting to get other's needs met. I basically run with the information I'm given and, in this case, assume the person must want the glass. 

Whereas my husband asks for as much info as possible. ""Why do I need to pick it up? Who is it for? Do you need this particular glass?"" And so on. 

\---

Ex 2)

My husband asked me what I would do if zombies came in the restaurant. I told him I would find a weapon and try to leave the area. 

When I asked my husband the same question he said ""how many zombies are here? can I leave the room? do I have access to the kitchen? etc."" before detailing what he would do. 

\---

Ex 3)

I asked my husband how he would build a house. He said, ""How many people are living there? Where will it be located?"" etc. before going into the details of what he would do. It's like he needed info to be able to start. When I told him ""you aren't given any of that info on this,"" he said, ""then I'm just going to build a house that I would want."" 

&amp;#x200B;

I wouldn't know where to start with building a home lol hire someone. 

\---

Ex 3a)

When I then had him tell me how he would build a house that was nice, but not something he would live in, he basically crafted a house that took away the special features he likes (real fireplace for an electric, huge master bed for a standard, etc). He said ""if I can't live in it, then that means I would have to sell it. So I'd have to make it more cookie cutter because those sell.""

\---

I'm wondering if my husband is actually displaying Te here in that he's trying to be as effective as possible through learning as much about the situation as possible? Not sure what I'm technically doing. 

In Ex 3, I'm wondering if he is searching for the Si details with his Te, but because he can't find them, he is using his Fi values? Am I misreading this? In Ex 3a, I'm seeing that he recognizes how his desires are diff than the masses and how to adjust them. I saw this as an Fi-Te axis thing. He didn't have much qualms about doing this/any sadness in doing this, so I would assume his Te is higher than Fi on the axis. 

&amp;#x200B;

ESTJ,"Hi I don't have any Estj friends so please excuse my random question in this forum. Me (32F) INFP and this guy (36M) ESTJ have been seeing each other about a month and met through a dinner with friends.

Right after dinner, I added him on Facebook and then he messaged me to get my number. Just a disclaimer I had a boyfriend at the time. After texting couple of days, ESTJ guy asks me out for dinner and drinks. He's extremely charming and kept dropping remarks about how he'd totally date me if I were single, and honestly I was open to the idea because I wasn't happy with my relationship for other reasons. And after that, we got intimate and I broke up with my boyfriend shortly after.

Currently we are still seeing each other and as I got to know him better find out from other friends that he has a reputation for playing girls and the pattern is usually not to be serious with them. He'd date a girl for a few weeks or even a month and end things with them the minute they ask for any sort of commitment or exclusivity. Now I start to freak out thinking whether I'm one of the 'conquests'. Our mutual friend also informed me that he had been seeing another girl pretty seriously just before meeting me, so he could well be seeing her still.

He's very assertive, direct, and always takes the initiative to call me every evening and even sometimes randomly in the day. Since we knew each other we have been meeting almost every day and it's almost like we're living together because I'm over at his place so much. He told me that I can even leave stuff over at his place and he'd be totally OK with him.

One discussion we've had is about exclusivity and our future together. He said he doesn't know where or what he sees us as but he definitely doesn't want me to sleep with any other guy and he would do the same for me. But we are both free to 'see' other people. Since he set this condition, I've been pretty confused.

One night while we were talking he suddenly teared up and told me that he's afraid that he'll get used to our time together and it will hurt him if it ends. I asked him what he wanted and he said he wasn't sure. I asked if he wanted to try a relationship and he said I was too important to him to try at this juncture having just broken up, he's afraid that I'll just use him as a rebound and leave. So we are back to the original 'arrangement' we talked about. 

So my question is what exactly does he want?",1558588147
ESTJ,"Normally I let things roll off of my back. I work in administration, I deal with other people‚Äôs junk all day,

But I can‚Äôt let this one go.

I got systematically worked out of a project by one person. ONE PERSON. For some reason my director has blinders on with this person, they can‚Äôt do any wrong. I worked my ass off for months on a project, completely by myself, actually with quite a bit of push back from other for even the thought of the project. Then this one person started working their way in, and then slowly they started having meeting without me, and then all of the sudden I wasn‚Äôt in the loop at all. But like I said earlier, I work in administration, so I have to be 1000% supportive of the project still. And I am, but it‚Äôs no longer my project.

Not that it‚Äôs in full swing, I ended up not getting a perk out of it. But literally everyone (but me and my employee) are getting this perk. I actually truly understand why we aren‚Äôt getting it, it‚Äôs nothing against us, it‚Äôs just the way the cookies landed. The person who took over didn‚Äôt do it purposefully, it just happened.

But when I brought up that I wasn‚Äôt happy about it, it‚Äôs as if I I‚Äôm an awful person for being upset.

And I‚Äôm UPSET. I can‚Äôt decide if I‚Äôm more upset at myself for letting my emotions get in the way or if I‚Äôm just upset by the whole situation piled together.

Either way it sucks. I don‚Äôt want to go into work tomorrow to deal with it, because I‚Äôm still upset and know I shouldn‚Äôt me. It‚Äôll set a bad example for my employee, and will seem like I‚Äôm not supportive of the whole project (which I am, because it was originally mine).

So now I‚Äôm laying in my bed just angry.

ESTJ,"Most people like to view ESTJs as micromanaging angry narcissistic whatever, considering the top few views in a basic google search and the things that people tend to share.

It is far from the truth in my case, I'm an ESTJ 9w8 7w6 3w2 so/sp

Consider me a gentle girl, fair in my criticism, and really dislike it when others take my words too hard. 

Unfortunately, I am a Te dom, well, this not exactly unfortunate, but I can only think with facts, and being a 973, I never really get affected or overwhelmed by emotions. 

Whatever I state is a hard fact, as soon as I open my mouth, all what I've been experiencing inside kust evaporates, I become cold, focused, detail oriented, and perhaps may joke around to lighten up as I really do not want to overwhelm others by appearing too cold or emotionally numb.

I really just want to be accepted as I am soc core, and my 973 tritype often leans to that direction, as much as I may appear as cold or distant, I try to be more expresionate and helpful at times, which is a little hard considering I do not have Fe in my stack.

I am really comfortable with reading many details as it can help me easily predict newer information, as the more I know the better. I was mistyped as INTJ in the past when I didn't know much about typology, mainly because of how I come off as, my love of preparation, and my slightly softer Te.

I guess I'm pretty cool, my friends group see me as energetic, realistic, and though very expressionless still a fun person to be with.

I don't really micromanage
I'm not traditional
I'm not rule obsessed
I don't really naturally want to or feel inclined to control others

ESTJ,"To preface, I'm going primarily off of CS Joseph's type grid to categorize him as an ESTJ. I'm pretty confident that I'm an INTJ. Also sorry for the wall of text. 

So anyway, we have been only been on two dates now over about 1.5 months of texting, though date 2 was more like spending a whole weekend together. We have great chemistry when we meet irl, he is very invested and focused on me and what I have to say to him, talks about his values, personal goals, family, friends, etc. Has mentioned me meeting the people in his life, has hinted he's interested in long term commitment. Has let slip how much he likes me and there's definitely a lot of attraction too.  Just overall feels sincere and genuine in his romantic interest in me. All the good stuff that makes a girl hopeful.

But we don't get to meet often because we're both young professionals in our mid 20s in competitive, high demand jobs, and his is even more so than mine (I know 70 hours work weeks every week is almost par for the course in his career). So the primary point of contact we have is texting or calling. And that's where my problems come in.

Guy almost never initiates a text or call. I don't mind initiating, honestly I generally initiate conversations with most of my friends also, so I am happy to text him a few times a day, just random things about my day or stuff I've read or have been thinking. 

How much he responds to it varies, but he generally replies quickly and thoughtfully to at least one of my messages each day. Sometimes he just leaves me on read on some of my messages. Sometimes he shares about his day unprompted and other times it's radio silence even when I ask him about his day. I did get insecure a few times and asked if he would rather I didn't contact him so much and he was quick to reassure me each time that he really likes seeing messages from me all day.

And then comes the dates. He has been punctual and enthusiastic for both dates so far, but has turned me down a few times too when I tried to arrange another date. And I don't know if I should stop trying to ask him out at all or wait to take this at his own pace? I'm generally confused about what the pace on this even is.

I guess I'd like some advice on how to move this forward. I know all the signs come across as a guy playing me hot and cold, but something in my gut tells me he really is genuine in his affections and just so busy he's prioritizing work way more than me. Which, fair, I wouldn't ditch work for him at this point in our relationship/acquaintance either. But I'd still like to get our communication better and get some sort of consistent schedule for getting together. Any thoughts on how I can best go about doing this? I don't mind initiating, just worry that he'd feel smothered or like I'm being clingy if I keep trying and don't just lay off and play it cool...? Our connection so far has been delightful and I'd like to see if it will actually grow into something.",1558241045

Personally, my mom is an ENFJ, my sister is an INFJ, and my dad is an ENFP. Somehow, I turned out ESTJ, and I know I think completely differently than the rest. However, I also think that this has softened my ST, and I think I feel pretty strongly for an ST type, but I don't let those feelings dictate the choices I make.

ESTJ,"Hi, im an infj and istj both at the same time.., interestingly i hv a friend that is estj and have hidden infp.  
I often catch him staring at me before, but I dont find it anymore now as we are getting close as friends. Sometimes we can talk about a lot of things including some secrets.   
As infj is my primary personality, it's a big deal for me. But sometimes i feel like our friendship is not balance. When i think he's special (bc i share some secret to him) he may think me as one of many (bc of his estj).   
I found out that i like him, but sometimes i feel like stupid bc it seems like it's me that always text him first (still in friendship corridor tho).   
He's very playful to others, but very often he'd act as if we are not so close in public. I know for sure that he doesnt mad at me because we use to make a joke and push each other's head when it's only two of us, but then in public he seems like ignoring me, sometimes he looks like acting cool.   
It hurts me sometimes and makes me wonder who am i for him.  
Do you think that's normal? Or is it bc of our bipolar personalities? Or is there something else? Thanks!",1556537830

I will preface this: I have had a really shitty day.

Due to the ESTJ generally maintaining a neutral composure, people tend to be more open about how they feel. ESTJs are however not, but just because we choose to keep how we feel to ourselves, does not mean we don‚Äôt have feelings. Typically an ESTJ feels very intensely. They love you with with everything they have or they hate you with everything they have.

We tend to be seen as emotionless and uncaring. It‚Äôs not that we don‚Äôt care about your feelings, we just don‚Äôt let your feelings change our mood.

With all of this being said: we still have feelings. We are not emotionless jerks who don‚Äôt care about other people.

We do care about your feelings.

&amp;#x200B;

 ***ESTJ Strengths***

**ESTJs** are loved by almost everyone they meet. They have their own brand of humor, and others are drawn to their charisma. They love to be the center of attention. They always try to be straight-forward with others ‚Äî a trait that others often appreciate ‚Äî and rarely sugar-coat things. **ESTJs** value security and stability, and expect others to follow through on their responsibilities. They hold themselves and others to high moral standards.

**ESTJs** are very strategic and are great problem-solvers. They are very resourceful and are able to adapt easily when necessary. They are able to think critically and logically when making decisions, rarely letting their emotions cloud their judgment. When confronted with a problem, **ESTJs** try to use the information available to make the best decision, hoping for the best. They place a great deal of trust their own judgement, which is based solely off of unbiased logic and reasoning. They have little tolerance for intuitive judgments. Rather, they prefer to evaluate the information available to them and make a decision quickly.

**ESTJs** feel a strong sense of duty. They feel a strong sense of civic duty, and likely vote in every election and seek out opportunities to improve the community.

**ESTJs** have initiative, and others often describe them as ‚Äú*doers*‚Äù. They are very competitive, and are always pushing themselves to be the best. This helps them become very successful in life, particularly in their careers. Others view them as reliable, trustworthy, honest, and likeable.

&amp;#x200B;

 ***ESTJ Weaknesses***

**ESTJs** always stick to their beliefs and values. They trust their own judgement above all others, even when they are wrong. Because of this **ESTJs** can be inflexible and stubborn. Others may see **ESTJs** are too forceful in their decisions.

Because **ESTJs** are so idealistic when it comes to their values, they may be unaccepting or judgmental towards others who do not share those values. They may seek out friends who are like themselves, and/or try fruitlessly to change others.

Because **ESTJs** are so focused on logic and reason, it may be challenging for them to deal with emotions. They have trouble expressing their emotions, as well as feeling empathy for others.

**ESTJs** thrive on structure and routine, and may have difficulty in new or unusual situations. They place a great deal of value on tradition, and change can make them very uncomfortable. **ESTJs** would much rather stick with a tried-and-true method, rather than a new idea that may not work.

&amp;#x200B;

 ***ESTJ Parenthood***

**ESTJs** are very family-oriented and take their responsibilities as parents very seriously. Ultimately, they want their children to grow up to be responsible and hard-working adults like themselves. **ESTJs**‚Äô home environment is very organized, and their children are expected to follow the rules. They expect their children to help with chores around the house and do their best academically.

As much as they want their children to develop a sense of responsibility, **ESTJs** also want their children to develop strong ideals and values. They always do their best to instill their own values and sense of responsibility in their children. Their hope is that their children will become strong-willed adults who stand up for what they believe in.

&amp;#x200B;

 ***ESTJ Romantic Relationships***

**ESTJs** value their romantic relationships highly, and are looking for a long-term commitment. They want a partner whom they can find stability and security in ‚Äî any partner who is unpredictable is not well-suited for an **ESTJ**. **ESTJs** will do whatever it takes to help their relationships succeed, and will put a tremendous amount of time and effort towards developing a deep, meaningful bond with their significant other.

**ESTJs** may have trouble being in-tune with their partner‚Äôs emotions. If their romantic partner is an ‚ÄúF‚Äù (*feeling*) personality type, this can be especially problematic. To overcome this, the F type partner must express their emotions directly with their **ESTJ** partner, rather than just holding them inside.

&amp;#x200B;

 ***ESTJ Friendships***

To an **ESTJ**, friends are secondary to their family. Others are often drawn to **ESTJs** outgoing and enthusiastic nature, and they are usually well-liked by others. **ESTJs** generally seek out friends who are like themselves ‚Äî someone who is dependable and smart, and shares the same interests and values as themselves. Their friendships center on trust and loyalty. Friends of **ESTJs** never have to worry about an **ESTJ** betraying them.

**ESTJs** are very aware of their own and others‚Äô social status. They are drawn to others who are well-liked, successful, and respected. However, **ESTJs** heightened awareness of social status can sometimes become overly-concerned with their social status. They may become preoccupied with getting others to like them.

&amp;#x200B;

 ***ESTJ Work Habits***

**ESTJs** are very organized. They have no trouble prioritizing various tasks each day, and enjoy the sense of accomplishment they get from checking everything off of their daily list. Seeing the tangible outcomes of their accomplishments is very rewarding and motivating for **ESTJs**.

**ESTJs** get along well with others in the workplace. They are often others‚Äô ‚Äú*go-to*‚Äù people when something needs to be accomplished. Others can always be certain **ESTJs** will follow through on any assigned projects.

&amp;#x200B;

 ***ESTJ Career Paths***

**ESTJs** thrive in an environment centered around routine and rules. Because of this, they may be likely to seek out careers that allow them to enforce these rules. **ESTJs** often work in law or government.

ESTJ,"Hello everyone, 

I am (an ENFP) fairly new to this personality-type-world, but I find it very interesting and useful. 

One of my closest friends through the last 8 years is ESTJ (she hasn't taken the test yet but I'm pretty confident in this and so far I have been quite good at 'guessing' people). 

We are very different in many ways but that has always been both a blessing and a curse for our relationship. 

However, the way she acts towards other people (especially when she is having a harsh day/week herself) is very hard for me to come to terms with. I find that it is very difficult to 'criticize' her without severely hurting her. So I have only gently 'hinted' at it by telling her that ""maybe you should consider how xx felt, when you said that"", or I try to make jokes with it, or when I'm in the same room when it happens I try to soften it out. 

We have some common friends and there have been a few incidents lately where she did and said things to our common friends which were way out of line (because she has a tendency to forget other people's feelings). She is at the same time one of the most loving and loyal persons, so when she does it to me I have mostly been able to ignore it by focusing on the nice things instead.  But I can no longer ignore the way she acts towards other people.

Combine this with the fact that she has withdrawn a lot from our relationship since she got a boyfriend who she directs most her time, energy and love towards now.
 
I am starting to feel more and more like we're strangers and that we are drifting apart. So I've come to the conclusion that I want to talk to her about this. I need to somehow tell her that some of the things she does are not okay (in my point of view). 

Which is where you guys come in: 
Can you help me with advice on how to best talk to her and tell her about it? I know it will hurt her so something inside me wants to sugar-coat it, but on the other hand I'm not sure if the message will really come though then. 

Any advice is appreciated! 

TL;DR: one of my best friends (very probable ESTJ) is acting hurtful towards other people. I (ENFP) have a hard time coping with this and I feel we are getting more and more like strangers. How do I best talk to her about it, in order to save our relationship?

ESTJ,"A short summary on how the glorified and all mighty Goddess Nora uses introverted sensing, aka Si~
{I'm ESTJ so I guess it makes sense I posted this in r/ESTJ }

By Nora herself


   To me, introverted sensing is focusing on inconsistencies, what that means is always focusing on minor details and comparing it to what you know that this object or the thing happening, for example: Lets say I was talking to a person, I'm already making a pattern and memorizing how they are talking, and when I learn more about this person, I sort of have a map in mind, so sooner or later, I start noticing any inconsistencies or changed in this person's behaviour or look, in how they talk, move, or etc (Especialy since these are traits or factors I generally pay attention to).

   So so far you gathered that it's about looking for inconsistencies and constantly noticing minor details, but what about my memory? Well I'd say memory is not that relelvant to Si, but it's very common they have a good memory. I can still remember many of my dreams of many years ago in great details, I can still recall the feeling of foods on my tongue that I've tried years ago, I can recall lots of moments and feelings that I perish and loved within that moment, which is why I'd be happy to experience many types of moments and can often live in the past because I can suffer certain nostalgia for certain sensations or emotions.

   I'm pretty stubborn and kind of hate change too, mainly the political or sociological one, for example how the word nigga suddenly became offensive. I strongly state that I don't care what you suddenly find offensive, you losers were using this word all your life and I will not change just because you suddenly became a pussy. Same goes to most SJW related topics.

   Something that I do not find relatable about most Si users that they're really good or useful for is how they care about wisdom, or learning from past mistakes, I'm too impulsive and don't really care to ""analyse"" or ""think about"" my past, like yeah I know shit happened, but who cares, I want to experience and do this thing right now, and whatever happens happens, I can fix it anyways and it won't probably be my fault anyways.

  Oh and I easily notice it when people look different too, even if it's a minor change.

     Written with much love and greatness,

ESTJ,"Hi everyone, I posted this on the ENTJ forum and some come up with the idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãESTJ and I would like your opinion
My test results are ENTJ, in some ENTJ with Loop (Te/Se).
We know that the tests are not completely reliable so I have studied the various functions, I have made my own idea and now I write here to get some confirmation.
I am 23 years old, I did Scientific High School because as a child I wanted to be a doctor, but after seeing that the hospital is not my environment, probably lack of empathy, I opted for Business Studies.
I have made this choice because I am interested in the ""position of control and power"", have more knowledge because I am mainly interested in starting my own business, or, if it goes wrong, being hired to play a senior role (if you have thought of the CEO congratulations you‚Äôre right). 
Always aim to have a main role in a group, organize, say what to do and I can‚Äôt stand that others are too relaxed, slow or don‚Äôt take things seriously, but at the same time I also know how to be humorous to ingratiate them.
I tend to be among the most organized and I want things to be done with principle.
Principle that often turns out to be my point of view in fact I tend to do things ‚Äúon my way‚Äù.
Yes, I‚Äòve been defined arrogant or as a ""I do everything"" or ""what I say is law"", and I don‚Äôt like others told me what to do.
Despite this I like to discuss ideas and theories, but I always tend to the pragmatic side of the thing and hardly change my mind if I'm not totally convinced.
A black or white situation.
I am quite ""future oriented "", but at the same time I‚Äôm interested in the present moment and act for what I want.
I make decisions quickly, but if it‚Äôs very important, I prefer to have as much information as possible.
I‚Äôve been called selfish, unable to put myself in others shoes, I'm not good with my emotions or those of others, but I'm ready to help when you really need, even without being asked.

ESTJ,"Hi,

Whenever I am reading review of the restaurant (tripadvisor for example), I get annoyed when a person describes the dish, but does not mention the price of it. To me it is absolutely crucial information and I do not understand how it would not be for anyone else.

Let me explain why - you read a review about the dish, see its photos. And in order to decide if that is a good deal (and if you'd consider visiting) you must know the price. Simplified example to get the point - lets say the average price of x dish in the city is 10 euros. So depending on the pricing you would know if it was a good deal (and worth visiting) or not. If it is 15eur, then maybe skip that place, if it is 7 eur - super deal and priority visit. 

&amp;#x200B;

Restaurant reviews without price mentioning is almost useless to me, because how would you know the value? 

&amp;#x200B;

Can somebody relate? I am curious if this is something of ESTJ thing, or just me thing (I value everything via price/quality ratio).

&amp;#x200B;

Ps: I also get facepalm moment when someone writes ""price for two with drinks was X"". I am like - wtf, do you know that drinks have various pricing and you di not even mention how many of those you got. It is completely useless information, how can anyone not understand that when they write it.",1550336802

ESTJ,"Hey it‚Äôs that ENTP again ... this is kind of a follow up on the other post about understanding ESTJ on a personal level.
It‚Äôs almost been 24 hours since I posted that and my ESTJ friend just acted out of character ... like shit.
I‚Äôve always had difficulties with my friend, we initially bonded over interests, aspirations and morals and I always found her reactions amusing. I‚Äôm very assertive, my other friend is aggressive and she is quite passive. We usually hang out as a trio. But I always found my ESTJ friend quite insensitive and lacks the ability to acknowledge other people‚Äôs efforts and sacrifices for her. That was usually our main conflict, her not putting in the same effort as we were, she‚Äôs very oblivious to the fact that we care about her but I don‚Äôt think she realises our efforts. She doesn‚Äôt notice things until they come up. I‚Äôve always admired her work ethic although she is not academically smart and tries to play it off as if she doesn‚Äôt study or works as hard and we‚Äôre similar in the way we don‚Äôt express our feelings a lot and look for effective and rational solutions. Everything I said up until this point in normal behaviour.

The problem is she got a boyfriend. I‚Äôve discovered that TODAY. She‚Äôs been dating him for A MONTH. Now I won‚Äôt lie but I do feel betrayed at the fact I was not worthy enough to know from the start, and she told this friend that I don‚Äôt know that well before me. She is my best friend but once I found this out I was questioning if she thought the same, but I didn‚Äôt express my anger to her because I needed to collect my thoughts and I needed to be sane for her to listen to me, my other friend found out before me. THIS IS A VERY LONG STORY.  If you want to know the full story feel free to message me. But in summary she used my other friend for herself disregarding my other friend‚Äôs feelings and efforts, displaying no remorse for my other friend. She used her for her boyfriend who doesn‚Äôt even treat her right, and has a toxic relationship. I always thought she was rational but she is a complete slave to her emotions when her boyfriend only shows lust.

My friend (Not the ESTJ) and I are very disappointed with her and she is so blind that she doesn‚Äôt see it. She thinks that everything is okay between us. My other friend believes we shouldn‚Äôt openly express our feelings to her until the time is right, but I feel like scolding her right now because I always kept it in when she doesn‚Äôt acknowledge us but she crossed the line with this one.

To clarify, I do not hate her at all and have no interest in cutting her off from my life. I‚Äôm just irritated and frustrated that I always have to point something out for her to realise. 

I‚Äôd like to know your thoughts. 

As a bonus, I feel like I said so many negative things about her that I‚Äôm going to talk shit about myself to kind of balance it out, I am cold and rude and I purposely say things to incite a reaction, I take pranks to far and laughed when I discovered she had a boyfriend because I didn‚Äôt think it was possible that someone would want to be with her.

ESTJ,"So how good is it really? Do you agree si makes you really good with memory? Of course everyone will say they don‚Äôt have bad memory but just wondering. I know a few of us seem to have it. Here‚Äôs a question.


remember back to your school days or if you‚Äôre in school it‚Äôs the question for you. Do you have to study? Or do you just pass tests and don‚Äôt study? Even if you‚Äôre in university?

Is it just me or is it a stj thing or an sj thing, so si, that we have superb or near photographic memory.

For instance I am at a university and I an studying political science it‚Äôs my 8th year in school, and I have really never needed to study, really. I just remember stuff. I don‚Äôt study and the lowest grade I usually get on tests are b grades. If not even a. I get a grades often enough.

I am not trying to brag I just want to know if it‚Äôs all of us, if it‚Äôs si. Or maybe it could be si te.


Also if someone tells you a password or a number can you remember it? My sister gave me her password last summer I think. I haven‚Äôt forgot it. I went to the apple store to basically trade in her phone so I could get a new one because I gave mine to her. And I was able to remember her password, not the exact one but the letters not how it was capitalized. But she was shocked. My father told me what his gas numbers were for his car and I am sure I still know the number. I should make a way to forget it because it‚Äôs useless information.

Do you think as estjs we are louder or brasher or both than entjs?

Do you think it‚Äôs easier to tell what we think then with entjs?",1548997461
ESTJ,"Hello! INTP here. I'm fairly new to this system and I'm having trouble typing the types I'm not familliar with.

I gave my mom (53) multiple tests based on functions to get a basic idea (I know tests aren't to be trusted, but I needed to start somewhere because she's very confusing). She scored as ESTJ multiple times. I then read the description to her and she agreed with a good part of it, but I'm still not convinced.

(I'm probably going into stereotypes here, but I barely know anything about this type, so I apologize)

First of all, I was almost sure that she was a feeling type just because how emotional and irrational she can be, especially in comparison with me and my brother (INTP and INTJ). But while she was doing the test, she always ended up choosing thinking over feeling options, especially the ones related to Te. 

And now that I think about it, her Te is strong when it comes to her job, I think? She has also been a director for 15+ years and stepped down only because it was too stressful and she got tired of fixing what other people messed up. The thing is, everyone there respects and loves her, and even now they want her to be a director again. She is both nice and demanding, very annoyed with mistakes but won't punish anyone unless necessary, knows how to do her job but often ranting about those who don't. She's good with everyone but won't be fake nice (says she dislikes those who put on a fake show?).

She loves to be in the right. Often when she tells a story, she needs to pinpoint how the other person told her 'yeah you are right'. She's proud of how rational she is. And now I'm thinking she's probably a thinker indeed, but it's different at home.

She has been a wonderful mom to us. This is where I'm most confused. We lost our dad at very young age so she tried her best for us to live well and she managed it. Both me and my brother made it a standard to do well in school so she hasn't had a chance to be demanding and stern. In fact, she's quite lenient and we get along really well. The only times we fight is when we don't show enough emotion/compassion or when we say something sarcastic or accidentally harsh.

We have it, of course. When my mom is sick or tired, I'm deeply concerned, but I fail at showing it. Then she sulks for hours and I can't communicate it with her. Her usual sentence is (in calm and emotional voice) 'you have to understand me'. She is never hysterical but often has such moments where it's like she's requesting an emotional response. She doesn't have actual arguments, it's just her feelings being hurt. But maybe this is just mom behavior? Or maybe she's lonely? Does it have anything to do with ESTJ?

She has a few good friends but doesn't have much energy to meet them often - she comes home from work tired and doesn't like having guests over for too long. But she likes it when it's people who are very fun or if she hasn't seen them in a while. At those times she's very outgoing and cheerful.

She takes pride in being very independent and says she will never remarry because she would hate it if a man came into our house and started ordering around. She always minds her own business with people unless asked for advice.

I won't make this even longer lol I hope I gave you enough insight to try and confirm that she is an ESTJ or deny it. Thank you in advance!",1548929322

Im new to all this but wanted to get some advice really. Im an estj female in my 30s and have been seeing a entp man for just over 6 months. although its fairly new, the relationship grew quickly and we are exclusive. Neither of us tend to just jump into relationships so i hope that helps understand how quickly we bonded.

Anyways, I mentioned to this entp that i really don't like lying and whatever happens always tell me the truth. I felt he was doing this at the very start which was great, then started to feel like he started telling me half-truths or not being fully honest about things. He is pretty secretive about thing too as he considers himself 'private'. I have noticed some holes in some of the stories he would tell me. I also noticed he was flirting and chatting to some girls over FB messenger but lying about it or saying that they have been friends for years (although i know for a fact they haven't). The last convo he has with one girl was asking her 'what her type is' to be her matchmaker but i dont feel he had any intensions of being a matchmaker and just wanted to get some sort of ego boost or know if he was her type.

I feel pretty uncomfortable about all this as i'm very very honest and loyal. I have tried to discuss my boundaries in general and why these are important to me prior to all of this happening so i almost feel hurt by this behaviour as its overstepping my boundaries.

ESTJ,"So I'm pretty sure my spouse is an estj (m). And I'm am entp (f). We have kids together, he works, I'm the sahp. 


It seems that he figures that his level of participation in our relationship stops at going to work. Extremely minimal help or engagement with the children, no help with anything inside the house (I have to do everything from cleaning to building maintenance). 


I'm on my feet 16 - 18 hours a day. He comes home, hits the couch and has his 5 hours of downtime, while expecting me to serve up dinner and snacks and take care of the kids and clean all the things up. 


If he does actually do stuff, I'm expected to be his dutiful assistant and he calls it bonding time. 


Also needs to be in control of everything to the extent of giving me shit list of more things to do while he's at work no matter what actually needs to get done in my world, and no down time or time with my friends. 


Expects nightly back rubs of top of it all and won't give back in return. Uses the fact that he works and supports the family as a manipulative tool. No matter the boundaries I lay, he just steam rolls me to make me relent, unless I tell him to go fuck himself.

While usually giving a real compliment to someone else should make them happier, the guy sometimes answers ""cool, so what?"". 

I am quite vocal and touchy-expressive when it comes to my emotions and while he says it doesnt bother him, he also says ""it's just unusual"".

While cuddling, I always ask for 5min more of cuddling and at some point, he got almost angry and just got away saying that we should get ready.

I could interpret this as a lack of interest but it doesnt seem to be the case either. (his cuddles are the bests)

 Likewise, he keeps describing what he is (very unprecisely) and I am supposed to pick up the meanings in terms of likes or dislikes. He doesnt say everything, seeing many things as ""obviously"" true while I never assume so...

Truth be told, I really dont know how to view it. Whether he seems interested, what kind of behaviour he is expecting?

We almost pulled it off.

I stifled my emotions.   I didn‚Äôt push.   I didn‚Äôt blow up the phone.  

I gave.   I gave thoughtful gifts.   I cooked.  I catered. 

I loved deeply.    

And it was ok.  My ESTJ would accept the love, care and gifts.   There would always be the polite thank you,

I internalized the muted responses and just worked harder.    The message I was getting that I wasn‚Äôt good enough.   This had a partial good effect on me.   I worked out. I lost weight.  

I tried to be chill like my ESTJ.  I never asked for anything,   I adapted.

ESTJ,"As the two extroverted types within the Delta Quadrant, I'm very intrigued by how we would interact. I have a few INFPs and ISTJs in my life so they're not as a much of a mystery to me. 

I often wonder if I'm an ESTJ with a preference for Ne, but my Fi is quite strong, and my Si is definitely my weakest. I tend to force myself into Ne-Te quite a lot and sometimes wonder if I prefer Te to Fi, although I can find that if I stay in Ne-Te too long I can develop a bit of a Messiah complex, so after a heavy day of Te I deffo need to ethically recalibrate by pondering over my favourite philosophers. I definitely prefer Si-Fi to Si-Te. 

I've definitely learnt a lot by examining the ISTJs but as we both have an unbalanced perceiving axis, I feel like it would be more fruitful now to observe ESTJs, I feel like we can help each other as I have the balanced judgement axis, so I like to believe (although this is probably my ego) that I find a perfect equilibrium between efficiency and ethics. But my perceptions man, not only do I find living in my own body and experiences traumatic on a day to day basis, but my memory is the worst so most of what's in my head is just me filling in a lot of blanks, which makes everything very pretty, but not very grounded or down to earth. I feel like I would greatly benefit from understanding the ESTJ, with your balanced perceiving aixs, you can use your own experience to gather facts and details with Si and then draw the necessary conclusions with your Ne. I find that INFPs tend to bring out the worst in me, which is my laziness, and my sadness, but I feel like the ESTJ I would find empowering and motivating. 

So here's a few questions that I have, that if you feel you have any specific insight that you may like to give, would be greatly appreciated:

- what differences do you notice between those of you who prefer Ne to Si, and vice versa? 

- what is inferior Fi like? How does it affect you? What do you notice in your day to day lives that shows you have inferior Fi? 

- do you ever feel like you wish you could stop moving? When in Ne-Te I feel like a hummingbird that has to continuously move from flower to flower to get sugar in order to stay aflight. I feel like being in Te nearly all the time must be tiring, 

- how do you use Si to balance your Ne? 

- I feel like we would get on, because of that shared Ne-Te that we may like to use together and may take us on many adventures and I feel like ESTJ company would help me get things done. However, I feel like I could also be very annoying, either because I'm a total Politically Correct, philosophical, &amp; ethical square. Or I can see us as being rivals, I know that I get a wee bit schemish, malevolent, and competitive when someone else who is also very unique and leader-ey is around, ( makes me insecure I guess) 

- do you have any other advice, feedback, anecdotes, tips, that you can offer? 

I feel at home in the Delta Quadrant, I feel like other quadrants have very different values, but interacting with types with the same functions as me is so refreshing and really helps me to ground my sense of self, and that I'm not a weird freak.

ESTJ,"INTJ female here.

WARNING: Really Long! I'm not giving a short version because I actually want good advice. Sorry.

Hey ESTJs, I need some advice on how to calm this situation with my ESTJ father. To start out, I don't blame him for any of this, we are very different in the ways we think, so this completely went over my head until he brought up how much I disrespected him. Of course, being the INTJ that I am, I was just thinking logically as to what I should do or not, and I didn't think about how he would see what I did as disrespectful, even though I suppose it was. My mind was in a totally different thinking process than his was, so I just didn't consider it.

My father (ESTJ) was playing a board game with my friends and siblings. He had just got home after everyone had eaten dinner, so obviously everyone was full and content, except for him of course since he hadn't eaten yet. Everyone was playing the game except one of my friends and myself. 
He requested that I make him some Venison steak and potatoes since that's what we ate. I know, simple request, I should have just made it and not overthought it.
I thought that since it was just my friend and I, she'd be left out from everyone if I spent (roughly) 40 minutes making the venison steak the way he likes it, and it's 10:00pm so it'd be late and I wouldn't be able to entertain our guest. 
So, I decided to give him just potatoes, extra so that he wouldn't still be hungry. This was quick, It was late, I could spend time with my friend so she wouldn't be left out, and I still gave him one of the things he wanted.

My friend brought up the potatoes to him, and then I went up about two minutes later.
I didn't think it was a big deal that I just made him potatoes, but apparently it was. 
He left the game and said he wanted to talk to be for 5 minutes. I got a huge lecture (won't go into detail with everything he said) on how I disrespected and embarrassed him. 
He does a lot for me, so he brought that up, saying that I couldn't do this one simple thing so I must not care about him. I told him that I do care about him and then I explained to him why I didn't do it, he got angry, only saw it as disrespectful, and then told me he was going to make the venison himself. I blocked him and said I'd make it for him, he angrily barged past and told me that he would make it himself and that I could do whatever it was I wanted to do. 

I don't exactly know what to do from here. I ended up telling my friends that he decided not to play, and then I went to bed since my friend took his spot, so I didn't have to worry about her anymore.

Also I realized that I forgot to apologise during our discussion, but I'm not going to right now because I might accidentally cause a scene and probably embarras him more, as well as myself.

To me, this wasn't a big deal until he made it into one, and he ended up embarrassing both of us when I don't think anyone else was even paying attention before. I'm not saying I wasn't in the wrong, but to me this is pretty dumb and I feel childish even having to write this.
Any advice? How would you feel if you were him and how would you want to be apologized to?
We just think so differently, I wasn't expecting him to be so mad. I wish it had, but it didn't even cross my mind that he'd see it that way.",1545205383

ESTJ,"**Congratulations!**

You have just selected your very own ESTJ Executive unit! As our most popularly selected unit available you are sure to be pleased. In fact, satisfaction is guaranteed! If you are unsatisfied with your unit simply submit a complaint directly to your unit itself.

## Your ESTJ will come with the following accessories:

* One (1) Professionally Tailored Power Suit‚Ñ¢
* One (1) Set of lounge clothes
* One (1) formal outfit for religious and formal events
* One (1) Laptop
* Two (2) Cell phones
* One (1) Gym Membership
* One (1) Pair of smart gloves for texting
* One (1) Bluetooth headset (for talking to people while talking to people)

## Software

Your ESTJ comes pre-programmed with the following traits;

**Te:** As the dominant function, this provides your ESTJ unit with unmatched efficiency and a keen understanding of what works in a practical setting. This function provides your unit with high levels of organization and practicality as well as a blunt clarity in communication style that other units may find abrasive.

**Si:** This function provides your unit with a mental database of previously established effective methods of handing situations it has encountered before that can be recalled quickly when needed.

**Ne:**¬†This function provides your unit with a boost to creative problem solving when facing a new situation or when previously established methods are no longer effective.

**Fi:**¬†This function provides your unit with moral indignation and superiority as well as curiously strong attachment bonds to carefully selected partners. As the inferior function your ESTJ will avoid accessing this software as much as possible as it directly interferes with their default mode.

## Getting Started

There is no need for a quick-start procedure. Your ESTJ will be fully functional and activated right out of the box. In fact, there is no box because excess packaging is highly inefficient.

## Modes

Get Shit Done Mode (*default*)- When in this mode your ESTJ will complete any and all necessary tasks required for successful completion of the assigned goals. In order to activate this mode, your ESTJ will require suggestion(s) and/or idea(s) to be presented. If more than one suggestion or idea is presented your ESTJ will automatically select the most effective or efficient one and proceed to get that shit done. This mode can be intermittently active for however long is necessary to complete the project.

Do Absolutely Nothing Mode - Automatically activated after completion of a major project deadline. Your ESTJ unit will cease all productive function and instead do absolutely nothing until it is sufficiently recharged.

Oh Hell No Mode - Activated whenever someone assumes your ESTJ unit will get shit done but neither asks nor directly informs your unit. When activated your ESTJ unit will express noticeable aggravation towards the assuming person and refuse to complete the task as a matter of principle.

You‚Äôre Doing It Wrong Mode - When activated this mode has two possible outcomes; 50% chance of activating the¬†‚Äúfine, give it to me‚Äù response. In such cases your ESTJ will assume responsibility for a task which they no longer can observe another unit fail to satisfactorily complete. If this response does not activate your ESTJ will simply watch in smug amusement considering it a fitting lesson. This mode will deactivate after your unit says¬†‚ÄúI told you so‚Äù

Touchy-Feely Mode (*locked*) - Randomly activated by what is assumed to be fluctuating levels of hormones and emotions within your ESTJ unit. Also can usually be unlocked and activated by having your ESTJ unit watch an action movie with a strong emotional component (i.e. Big Hero 6)

## Relationships with Other Units

**NF:** Finds them confusing but likable. Good project partners that provide good energy to a group.

**NT:** Generally very confused by them. Sometimes Infuriating, but your ESTJ is unable to walk away from what it perceives to be a mess. Often surprised that NTs do not walk away first. Confused by their seeming inability to accept statements at face value and instead to analyze everything.

**SJ:** These units make sense to your ESTJ, who considers them to be good people provided they are willing to try something new when the old methods do not work.

**SP:** Frequently cause eye rolling in your ESTJ. Finds them fun to have around but hard to take seriously or respect. When SP units feed your ESTJ it will probably like them, but may still not respect them.

## Feeding

For optimal performance, provide your ESTJ with food on a regular basis. While it will cook for itself, cooking is seen as an interruption to getting shit done. Cooking is inefficient because you have to cook again at the next meal.

## Grooming

Your ESTJ will groom itself. No need to concern yourself there.

## Sleeping

Your ESTJ will automatically enter sleep mode when the body shuts down. Any attempt to induce sleep prior to shut down will be met with hostile resistance.

## Frequently Asked Questions

*What is my ESTJ thinking?*  
Whatever the last thing you ESTJ said was.

*What is my ESTJ feeling?*  
Neutral unless otherwise stated

Come up with a detailed plan and submit it to your ESTJ. Wait for notes providing suggestions for improvement. Follow the notes.

*Why does my ESTJ have so much criticism?*

Question: how do you go about in developing a romantic interest in someone?

Basically, from the start, I decide if I like this person romantically.

ESTJ,"I recently made a good friend. He is kind, confident, smart, and really funny.
The other day we took a 16personalities quiz in school to find ‚Äúcollege career options‚Äù. I hadn‚Äôt really heard of MBTI before, but I‚Äôve found this whole personality thing really interesting. I got ISFJ. My friend got ESTJ, but he thinks it describes him more 6 months ago than it does now. Is it possible that he is going through a personality change? Or was he just mistyped?

I looked further into MBTI because I want to understand my friends and family better. My ESTJ friend barely shows any emotion, making it hard for me to understand him. But I appreciate all of the things he has done for me, like helping me with homework, sending me memes at night, helping me carry stuff, and giving me donuts and candy. He‚Äôs also told me on a TBH, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if you can tell, but you‚Äôre SUCH a good friend to me. I honestly couldn‚Äôt ask for a better friend.‚Äù I‚Äôve made him get-well-soon cards, brought him food, and made him drawings. I‚Äôve even taught him Fortnite dances and helped him earn Snapchat trophies. üòÇ

These stereotypes do not describe him at all. He isn‚Äôt bossy or a control-freak. He isn‚Äôt always ‚Äúworking‚Äù. He has straight As and at the same time knows how to have a blast with friends! He isn‚Äôt a bully or mean. He isn‚Äôt uptight. He isn‚Äôt a natural leader. He isn‚Äôt blunt. He doesn‚Äôt get easily stressed. 

Even though my friend doesn‚Äôt fit these stereotypes and he says he‚Äôs changed, I still think he is an ESTJ. He is really Extroverted, very obServant (Lives completely in the moment, constantly pointing out things that I don‚Äôt even notice!), and a Thinker because he is barely in touch with his emotions. I can‚Äôt tell if he is J or P, but ESTP doesn‚Äôt really describe him.

He fits the general 16personalities description because he is dedicated, strong-willed, direct, loyal, reliable, judge-mental, too focused on social status, and has difficulty expressing emotion. 

So yeah, I‚Äôm really confused. Even though he does not fit these stereotypes, is he still an ESTJ?

I also want to take a moment to appreciate the ESTJ. I am so thankful for all of the actions that you do; you‚Äôre a lot more than just words. I love how honest and direct you are. Your confidence and strong-will really motivates me. I know I can trust you and rely on you. Thanks for being so smart and explaining stuff to me. Thanks for being so patient and listening to me.

ESTJ,"I think I've found a lead to a perfect system of ethics, but I need help from an ESTJ. The system consists of Jungian psychology, DaveSuperPower's lexicon, and balance. However, energy is also important to take into account.

I think moral philosophy has become a mess, lacking in organization (particularly Si). I think the same can be said for politics.


I'm trying to get it down to the fundamentals, and it needs to be Si/Ni organized.

Here's what I have:

Self vs. Tribe, Reason vs. Value, Gather vs. Organize, Imagination vs. Fact (still needs work)

**Extensions:** Ti (Self+Reason) Te (Tribe+Reason) Fi (Self+Value) Fe (Tribe+Value) Si (Organize+Fact) Se (Gather+Fact) Ni (Organize+Imagination..might still need work) Ne (Gather+Imagination..might still need work)

**Deciders:** Ti, Te, Fi, Fe

**Observers:** Ni, Ne, Si, Se

**Jungian psychology:** Persona, Ego, Shadow, Self

Other things are: Energy (broadest sense which extends to psychology, economics, positive/negative impact, chain reactions, career acceleration, etc.)

Other factors: Operant/Classical Conditioning, Subliminal/Supraliminal Stimuli, sentient life (both animals and humans)

Certain ways of thinking seem to be critical to figuring out this universal system of ethics. Here's an example. When there's a duality, the answer is a middle way. Left-wing vs. Right-wing? What's in the middle? Two more examples: When two opposing forces are pushed together, stability is created...I think. There's also Yin-Yang, balance, and equality.",1542150608

She is not only very smart and conscientious but also really sweet and nice to everyone. I just sometimes wish she would be less shy. 

Four months ago our daughter started to date a guy whom I will call Noah. He is really kind and caring and also very understanding of her insecurities. He is exactly what she needs. He is very extroverted and a bit careless but in my opinion he is good for her and totally unthreatening as he has clearly a good heart. Noah is very polite towards my husband and me. And I think he really wants us to like him. 

My daughter is clearly in love with him and he loves her as much as she loves him. They are really cute together.

But my husband hates Noah. In theory he is comfortable with her dating, but in practice he just doesn‚Äôt wants her to date at all. He is really mean to Noah and basically bullies him. He also often jokes that he could hurt/kill Noah. Noah stays respectful, but its clear that Noah is not too sad when my husband is away.

Our daughter is really offended by my husbands behaviour. She thinks that he should trust her more. And I feel that my husbands behaviour pushes her away from us. (Noahs Parents are both really nice to her.)

ESTJ are kiss ass type to bosses so that is where I think I am different. I challenge authority and hate playing games. Here are pointers about me and tell me what you think:


This is me (not sure INTJ or ISTJ)

I need details and facts to understand the situation. If I already have the facts from previous experience I can judge easily.

Very intimidating.

Dont care about the talk unless I am interested.

Hate emotions.

Cant deal with emotional people bc I cant grasp it.

You will do what I say attitude.

Once I have the details about a person, I become very judgmental. 


Fighting with authority (If the leader is a coward throwing others 
under the bus, I go heads on  and challenge him/her)

I push and get stuff done.
When at bars, socializing I am very business and to the point. 

I dont pickup on hints.

I am very literal.

I cant stand people without hobbies and goals.

I look down on people without bachelors.

Shut the fuck up is something I say if I dont agree with you.

If someone changes their mood consistently I call them out and tell them they dont belong in this world.

Ribbing and bantering is not something I do, so when done to me its WW3. 

I like to run the show.

Hello, Good Morning, How are you...I am more like get to the point or stfu.

Mom is ENFJ and she is on block. Cant deal with her emotions.

When having a bad day or a bad time, Others show affection or feel bad for me, which turns me off. I am more like give me a solution or stfu.

I hate people who are limited.

I like men who build from buildings to engineer.

I enjoy running.

I have no tact at times.

I am blunt.

I get to the point.

I want people to Get to the point.

I hate insecure people. I want them to deal with their own insecurities.

I hate giving affirmations. Put yourself out there, get hit, and get the job done.

I cannot stand latinos since they are too emotional.

I do not like indian bc they are too passive aggressive.

I hate male posers who talk but when it comes to fight for you believe in they pussy out.

I like to control the conversation.

I had an ESTJ VP boss who was pressured by his ENTJ boss to do things. ESTJ gave in and I lost respect for him. Since ESTJ could not control me, he wrote me up as an engineer everyday over nothing. I had a huge blowout with him. I told him that you are not a leader but a coward giving into ENTJ. Believe in your team and fight against that ENTJ. He didnt and I got fired since I did not give in. 

I worked with ENFJ and they are too people pleasers for me. If you dont do what they say, they passive aggressively attack you which makes me loose my shit.

I like to stay home and relax as it recharges me. 

I love alone time.

I do not answer to no one.

If i dont get my way, i destroy it.

I do not like staying in touch with exes. There is a reason they are ex. 

Out of sight, out of mind.

Hate talking about emotions.

ESTJ,"Hi Everyone,

This survey is entirely anonymous. Please answer as honestly as possible, even if you don't like your answers.

[CLICK HERE FOR SURVEY](https://goo.gl/forms/jbXVEyrSwhedbK3C3)

I'm really interested in Brene Brown's work on shame, vulnerability and wholeheartedness. I've noticed that, while MBTI focuses on highlighting our strengths, the discussions in many MBTI communities seem to focus on the struggle to overcome flaws or struggles with vulnerability. It seems that we're all drawn here to tinker around inside our behaviors, understand something important about ourselves, or understand the way we interact with the world. I'm wondering (informally, this is just for fun) if there's a pattern to MBTI personality types, and ease of wholeheartedness/living with courage.

So, I made this quick survey. Enjoy!(?)

Bonus Question: What socially or emotionally vulnerable experience has done the most to define your identity?",1539019289

ESTJ,"So, I‚Äôm an infp and I‚Äôve been pretty close friends with an estj for almost 10 years now. She used to be so much fun when we were younger, as long as I didn‚Äôt bring up any topic that wasn‚Äôt purely fluffy/surfacey.  But of course, you can‚Äôt continue that way for 10 years. She‚Äôs never been willing to listen to anyone with values or feelings different from her own. Her extreme unwillingness to listen and need to be right and in charge has lead to some really rough treatment of... a lot of people, including myself. She‚Äôs grown some in the past year, but she‚Äôs still very very mean to me. She thinks that she‚Äôs a very nice person. She always says that she‚Äôs a good problem solver in arguments and that she‚Äôs kind, but she‚Äôs neither of those things because of her stubbornness and need for power/being right. I also have finally accepted the fact that she does and says things to tear me down and hurt me on purpose. The relationship has honestly been toxic for years now, but I‚Äôve just been too afraid to end the friendship. I really don‚Äôt even know how to go about it. But I honestly just can‚Äôt stand it anymore and for the sake of my mental health, I just really need her out of my life. As stated above, she won‚Äôt listen to anything. So there‚Äôs no point in more attempts at gentle/civil conversation about how she‚Äôs hurting me. Please help me. 

Also, I just want to say that I know that not all estjs are terrible toxic people, so please don‚Äôt take offense to anything I‚Äôve said about her! I‚Äôm aware that she‚Äôs an unhealthy person that‚Äôs just completely unwilling to grow. ",1538594682

ESTJ,"I'm INFP, he's ESTP/J. Leaning more towards ESTJ, but he could be either one. As you can tell, we're basically polar opposites. I'm super conflict avoidant, he's extremely confrontational and loves picking fights with people. He genuinely enjoys pushing people's buttons and trying to get under their skin. To him, he says what he feels and views it as ""telling it like it is."" He views this blunt directness as a positive trait, and to him people who aren't like this need to change. Problem is, he genuinely doesn't care if what he says is hurtful, and it often is. Yesterday he thought it was funny to say ""wouldn't it be funny if I could give you an eating disorder"" then spent the rest of the day calling me fat. I'm actually super thin and not remotely fat. He doesn't know this, but I've actually had some issues with disordered eating. That's just one in a million examples of him being super mean &amp; confrontational. I'm sure I'm on the more sensitive side, but in the majority of these conflicts it's just him starting crap for no reason. He seems to want me to change my personality to be ""less weird"" and more like him, but why can't he just accept me for how I am? INFPs normally feel like weird outsiders anyway, but combined with an ESTJ/P who frequently says I'm weird, I'm really feeling frustrated and hurt.

I never pick fights with anyone, I always try to diffuse these conflicts ASAP. I'm sure my fellow INFPs are the same way. I've told him I hate when he starts fights &amp; intentionally starts drama/conflicts, but to him he thinks it's funny and genuinely gets a sadistic kick out of it. He's said I'm super quiet (I am) and the only way to get me to talk to him is if he picks fights &amp; tries to get me riled up. Idk why tf he thinks this, cuz I'm happy to talk if he's nice. But a lot of the time I just want to be left alone, and we don't even have any common interests to talk about. We literally have nothing in common, and our personalities are polar opposites. I really do want a good relationship with him, but he makes it so difficult even though I've told him countless times that I'm always happy to talk to him as long as he's nice and doesn't start fights or deliberately tries to be mean/annoy me.

Your efficiency, your ability to push on that tender area to get people to react and do your will, your absolute adherence to the logical, to the numbered list.  Your passion and your absolute devotion to be the best you surely are.

I have one message to deliver to you, boss, and I know you have the wit to understand.  

Basically, you are obsolete.

Your model has been the sexiest of the sexy, the fit guaranteeing the fittest, the sharpest amongst the pointedly stabbing.

But you deserve to be informed, that your model has had it's time and is deserving your glorious time off you generally won't consider you deserve.

I am faster than you, I am more efficient than you, I actually have a utilization of logic that isn't self-cannibalizing.  I can lead other men without making them want to deservedly stab me in the throat, I can speak to someone without being patronizing, I do not have time for your sadism or your disregard.  In the same vein you look at a person and can quickly sum up their value and their worth to you, I am saying to you now, there is no use for you in a world that never asked you to teach it a fucking lesson.  The lesson you have to teach is that of cruelty, of disregard, or of lack of even the understanding of what you cannot understand or possibly comprehend due to your configuration.

Basically, it comes down to this.  The next time you decide to flex your superficial power to hurt either myself or my compatriot, it's over.  I'm not only ripping out your jugular, I am taking out that which you love.  I am grabbing your wife by her pussy, and giving your mother a throat transplant.  I will speak the language you understand, you mother fucking masochistic piece of shit, and I will take you to that place you are too much of a fucking pussy to ever venture at any time due to lack of guts or anything resembling endurance, or basic tolerance.  I am your doppelganger and your nemesis, and you have taught me well.  You will scream like an utter bitch in absolute disbelief as I give you that which you have begged from me since my inception, and I will assure you, you will be satisfied with my performance.

Hope you have found god, you worthless cocksucking waste of any fucking resource with absolutely any fucking worth whatsoever.

So take it easy, enjoy the day, spend a few minutes sniffing the rose bush, but know that there is absolutely no animosity here.  You will not suffer, nor will those you love.

ESTJ,"Honestly I posted this in another subreddit, and I described myself to see what people thought and they told me I seem more like an ESTJ or ENTJ. So I'm hoping perhaps I can find out here what you guys think.

So one thing to point out, I'm a high school graduate, but unfortunately with so many complications I cant go to college yet. This frustrates me because I just dislike me staying at home. I try my best finding a job, and I overall don't want to stay at home doing nothing.

Anyways I'm just gonna describe myself and from there on you guys can determine what y'all think.

1.Appearance-wise, I seem serious, analytical, and intelligent. People meeting me at first tends to see me as polite but dry. One of my weaknesses is small talk. I can handle it, but for some reason i just feel that unless im talking about something important to me, its pointless.

2.Personality-wise, I am just very serious and ambitious. In high school I was lazy unless there was something I was interested in or it mattered to me. I'm incredibly short-tempered and usually have emotional outbursts when things dont go my way. Now I'm aware this is not a good thing, so I'm hoping to find a way to change that. I'm also incredibly prideful, so I tend to feel like shit if i see others do better than me, and drives me to do better.

3.My goals in life is to pursue leadership/management positions and try my best to learn how to lead. There is nothing more I want in my life to be seen as a leader, to see that the people i help and have under control work well with me. I genuinely want to learn how to be outstanding. My Career goals for this is honestly getting a management job, whether in the Military, Law Enforcement, or Government.

4.My negative side is I tend to have emotional outbursts. I am logical and to the point, but due to my childhood being shit or the past in which I felt disrespected and taken advantage of, I've kind of developed a ""My way or the high way"" attitude, which is not practical to have outwardly. Besides anger, empathy is very limited and only for my family and friends. 

5.I can't stand to think that people or things get in my way of my goals. I tend to become ruthless and full of rage. I tend to be obedient and reliable since I'm well grounded most of the time.

6.Remember the pride part? Well back then, my ego was a big thing. I realize that this was toxic, but nevertheless has gotten me to become controlling with my past relationships and friends. 

7.I have a close group of friends. I'm not extroverted in the sense that I have a bunch of friends, but rather I have a close group of friends and outside of it I meet different sorts of people. I tend to be very outgoing with my friends and social when It requires it.

8.Ive rarely been in a leadership position in high school. I tried running for class president one time along with joining a Business club, I participated there a lot. Besides that though, I have little to no leadership experience, and it genuinely makes me feel like shit. I can't stand being a loser or average. I want to stand out, become a leader so I can help others and be looked upto. I am known for being ""egotistic"" but I feel that being ambitious has made me feel good.

9.At the moment, my sense of success and control over things represent who I am, without both, I'm nothing. Sort of how I'm feeling now recently.

10. I tend to get super jealous and vengeful. Once again, I'm trying to find a way to keep it under control as I know it's not healthy.

For sure I'm a ""TJ"" but I keep on being even on the E and I. The S and N are kinda hard to understand. All I know is that I usually analyze my surroundings and try to know the meaning behind it all. I'll just go ahead and barf as much of me as I can lol, you guys determine it from there.

1. My goals in life is to be in a management position and learn leadership skills. My career path that I want to take is whether the Military, Finance, or a government job of some sort.


2. The reason I want to pursue these goals is because I love the idea of being in an authorative position. I deserve to be and I have every reason to be in a position of power because I know what's best. I wouldn't mind doing whatever it takes to uphold my position, even if it hurts others.


3. Personality-wise, I am serious, analytical, with people, I hate small talk, it's pointless and offers no benefits. When speaking to others about work or anything important, I am much more extroverted. I don't like socializing not because of shyness, but rather because I have better things to do. My downsides I'd say is my vengeful moments. This in turn has made me lose my limits and try to get back at people no matter what.


4. I have very few close friends, and those friends regard me as ruthless and short-tempered when things don't go my way. In the early years, I felt taken advantage of, this in turn has made me hate any sense of vulnerability and emotional ties. Rarely do I recall ever connecting with someone closely.

5.Relationship-wise, I ALWAYS am controlling. I'm not sure why, usually I need to know what's going on or else I lose a sense of control over the other person. I've lost my temper the most in one.

5. In high school, I was lazy so I did horrible in it. At work/college, I'm usually hard working assuming it depends on my long-term goals and career path. I value my pride, family, and my sense of control.

6.i lose my temper Easily over things. Anything going against my plans or against me I tend to get angry because i want things MY way. Of course if i become self-aware I'll purposefully control my temper and try to reason with others.

I would love to see what people think. ",1532324035
ESTJ,"Hi, I'm a 25M ENFP who is dating a 20F ESTJ. She has been gone for 4 weeks at a summer training program for teachers (about a 5 hour drive away), and I am planning to drive out to visit her this weekend. 

Some background - we are both from a very conservative Christan setting, and have individually committed to be celibate until marriage. We have been dating for about 6 months now. Our relationship still feels a little ""formal"" to me as we are not interested in a rapidly progressing relationship, choosing to instead take our time and make sure we are compatible.

I just got a nice card in the mail today (we snail mail each other on occasion) that just said that she feels nervous that I am coming to visit and she is afraid she won't be a good host for me, in basically so many words. I thought it was very sweet, but I'm a little confused as to what she is trying to accomplish by sending this - obviously it was important enough to her to go to the bother of going to the store, buying a card, and mailing it to me.

What are some things that would motivate an ESTJ to go to so much effort just to share something like this?",1532143673

She wants men to maintain distance, want men to walk far from her, she always calls &amp; reassure men as brother, elderly people as a father everytime she met them eventhough they maintain proper boundaries with her.

ESTJ,"Hello! I am an ESTJ-T that is 53% Extroverted, 47% Introverted. Essentially, an Ambiverted ESTJ. (Not to be confused with an ISTJ. The description and definition of that type doesn't match me)

So basically, I was just given a job offer by a family friend, who is the owner of a brand new StateFarm branch. I would be doing daily 4 hour shifts as a Telemarketer for the insurance. Convince them to get a ""free quote"" and then transfer the number and move on to the next call.

My question is, has anyone else here with the ESTJ (or ESTJ-T) personality had experience with Telemarketing?

I am wondering if this is a good job for an ESTJ, or not. 

I only have 2 concerns.

#1: My ability to ""move on"" to the next customer. I have noticed in myself that after a conversation, my head gets a little ""clouded"" with thoughts on the convo, until I allow myself a short time to ""gather my thoughts"" or ""mentally process"" the convo or interaction. I can BEST move on, after that point. I figure it would likely take me around 1-2 minutes after each call, unless I trained myself to do better than that.

#2: Another concern is what people think of me. I worry a bit too much on the opinions of other people. If I were to have an extremely negative reaction over the phone, I may likely find it really hard to move on to another call. Especially with confidence/enthusiasm.


Besides those 2 things, everything seems fantastic about this offer. It would basically be my first job, and I am nearly 18 years of age. And as I said, the employer (and most of the employees) are friends.


Thanks so much guys, it means alot to me that you read all that.",1531111149

ESTJ,"I've had an on and off relationship with an ESTJ for a few years now. We were high school sweethearts but broke up during college due to miscommunication regarding me leaving (he was a year younger than me) and uncertainty of how to handle the transition. We didn't talk much after that, but have reconnected here and there, and have had a sort of romantic FWB situation since then. I feel that he understands me and I understand him in a way beyond words-- sort of an underlying automatic ""click"" that we have, but I also feel that we are incredibly different and separate when it comes to our N and S. I'm used to being around T's, but all of my other close relationships have been N's like me. I think often about abstract concepts and can feel lonesome at the lack of intellectual connection with this partner (not to say he's incapable of it; just that he doesn't see the point).   


I respect and admire his differences, but many times I feel neglected even when I know he isn't neglecting me. Examples of this:

* He will sort of ignore me at social events. I'm an extrovert, but I'm a shy extrovert, so this can be difficult for me. His friends are also rather different than me as they're all S's, so this can leave me feeling pretty left out and uncomfortable, as though I don't belong and am unliked, even if this isn't the case.
* He is pretty much always neutral and stoic. He's rarely affectionate or cutesy unless he is in a playful mood, and these moods seem completely random and uncommon. This is something I think I can deal with but I don't fully understand it.
* There are a lot of times we don't know what to talk with one another about. I think this has a lot to do with the N/S difference. On Valentine's Day one year we went out to eat and didn't really speak to one another at all. We just sort of sat in silence. Again, it was a knowing kind of silence, but I can't help but feel the need to fill that silence in order to connect to him.
* He is an incredibly quiet extrovert, not shy-- just quiet. He tends to hang around other people who are really outgoing and funny. I'm not outgoing, and although I think I can be funny at times, I'm generally pretty serious. I end up not bringing out that humorous and playful side of him that he enjoys so much when around his friends, and it can feel like I'm not pleasurable for him to be around, or if I am that the only ""conversation"" we have is superficial witty banter. 

I hope an ESTJ here will be able to give me more insight. I googled about this and didn't find much. I'm not sure if this is a feasible relationship, but I do feel an intense magnetism toward him and would like to connect further. I'm afraid that if we do pursue a more serious romantic relationship in the future it will be similar to our relationship in high school in that he was sort of just quiet and distant from me most of the time, even when he truly loved me. Thanks in advance for any help.

I love my mother to the point I'd die for her. This woman has protected me, taught me valuable life skills, I've learned everything I needed to survive from my ESTJ mother. At times I've hated her bluntness, but over time I have come to appreciate it. I may silently seethe for a bit, but I've learned to think about what was said. I appreciate her honesty the most. 

As an INFP I know I was probably emotional and as a teen I was hard on her at times with my storming off and sulking. But man did I learn how to appreciate honesty and have grown thicker skin because of my mom. 

I swear as an INFP, I always see you guys as the smartest people I know. Dutiful, clever, no nonsense, intelligent, brave, and fun. 

I know there have been infp who hate their estj parents. But I remember when my mom would be strict about something I'd always think she was doing things for my protection and wouldn't think much of it. I swear you estjs are always right about people when it comes to a judge of character.


I have avoided some really effed up folks and situations by using my mother's advice. Also if you are an INFP who is reading this, just know that your este parents means well. They are protective parents, their honesty isn't to hurt you but again to protect you believe it or not. They don't see no sense in lying as it wouldn't be helpful to you and that the world will be much crueler in telling you the truth vs them. Also don't take things super personal. I know it's hard, but try to get out of our feelings for a bit. 

ESTJ parents with INFP kids, just be gentle and understand that we are sensitive. We feel things deeply. Its better to suggest things to us rather than set it as rule. And little bit of some independence. 

I swear me and my mom are very close.

Why we aren't in a relationship is complicated but mainly it relates with his home situation as he's still married with young children, although separated. He also has various sexual relationships with other women given his separation and I don't think he's ready to be exclusive. I know this sounds really bad or like I'm not important to him, but that's definitely not the case.

ESTJ,"I'm back to understand more about my dual!

Here are a couple scenarios...

1) You say something harsh that ends up (mildly) upsetting 

a. an acquaintance 

b. a friend 

c. a significant other 

d. a relative 

Regarding your decision to say this thing, which statement(s) usually describe your thought process? 

i. ""I didn't know that would upset them and I feel bad"" 

ii. ""I didn't know that would upset them but I don't care""

iii. ""I didn't know that would upset them but I'm happy about it""

iv. ""I did know that would upset them but I feel bad""

v. ""I did know that would upset them and I don't care""

vi. ""I did know that would upset them and I'm happy about it""

Lets say the importance of voicing that thought was neutral, but feel free to explore if the situation was critical, or if the upset was more than mild.

2) You end up in a heated argument with someone who

a. you dislike and is generally an insensitive person, including towards you

b. you dislike and is generally a sensitive person, including towards you

c. you like and is generally an insensitive towards, including towards you 

d. you like and is generally a sensitive person, including towards you

You end up attacking one of their deep insecurities, shutting them up almost instantly. In the silence that follows, you think

i. ""I went too far and feel guilty now, I need to make this better.""

ii. ""I shouldn't have said that but this will smooth out on its own.""

iii. ""Interesting, I wonder what they'll say next.""

iv. ""Good, I'm winning the argument.""

Bonus unrelated question: Do you like such compliments?

""I find you so interesting/intriguing""

""You're very creative""

""You have a unique personality""

 Type Four‚ÄîLevels of Development

Healthy Levels

Level 1 (At Their Best): Profoundly creative, expressing the personal and the universal, possibly in a work of art. Inspired, self-renewing and regenerating: able to transform all their experiences into something valuable: self-creative.

Level 2: Self-aware, introspective, on the ""search for self,"" aware of feelings and inner impulses. Sensitive and intuitive both to self and others: gentle, tactful, compassionate.

Level 3: Highly personal, individualistic, ""true to self."" Self-revealing, emotionally honest, humane. Ironic view of self and life: can be serious and funny, vulnerable and emotionally strong.

Average Levels

Level 4: Take an artistic, romantic orientation to life, creating a beautiful, aesthetic environment to cultivate and prolong personal feelings. Heighten reality through fantasy, passionate feelings, and the imagination.

Level 5: To stay in touch with feelings, they interiorize everything, taking everything personally, but become self-absorbed and introverted, moody and hypersensitive, shy and self-conscious, unable to be spontaneous or to ""get out of themselves."" Stay withdrawn to protect their self-image and to buy time to sort out feelings.

Level 6: Gradually think that they are different from others, and feel that they are exempt from living as everyone else does. They become melancholy dreamers, disdainful, decadent, and sensual, living in a fantasy world. Self-pity and envy of others leads to self-indulgence, and to becoming increasingly impractical, unproductive, effete, and precious.

Unhealthy Levels

Level 7: When dreams fail, become self-inhibiting and angry at self, depressed and alienated from self and others, blocked and emotionally paralyzed. Ashamed of self, fatigued and unable to function.

Level 8: Tormented by delusional self-contempt, self-reproaches, self-hatred, and morbid thoughts: everything is a source of torment. Blaming others, they drive away anyone who tries to help them.

Level 9: Despairing, feel hopeless and become self-destructive, possibly abusing alcohol or drugs to escape. In the extreme: emotional breakdown or suicide is likely. Generally corresponds to the Avoidant, Depressive, and Narcissistic personality disorders.",1523780175

ESTJ,"Hello! 

I need some advice about a coworker who I believe is an ESTJ for a couple of reasons:

- He has a strong presence. As in I sense the dominance and I'm just a little marshmallow. üòÇüëçüèª

- He's very articulate in the way he speaks. I asked him once, ""How was your weekend?"" And he said, ""It was pretty uneventful."" I like his word choices though. Also when he talks to people, he's so smooth. The way he can add on to the conversations so easily, I'm shocked. 

- His facial expressions can be very... serious. Like he's a serious person.

- He said he didn't believe in ghosts. Okay this one isn't really a trait lol but just wanted to add it in as in he has strong beliefs?

*I thought he could be an ESFJ, but I don't see him as a feeler.

This is what I need help with:

I've noticed he's taken a liking to me. It really became clear when he asked me about my future goals and rarely anybody ask me questions about me so I was flattered. The way he tries to compose himself with this serious persona but I know he's a bit nervous talking to me. I accidentally flirted with him out of nervousness and shyness of him liking me lol. I hope I not giving him missignals because I'm unsure of my feelings of him.

But at least he laughs at my jokes lolol. üëçüèª

Below is an overview of the Big 5 for those who are unfamiliar.

-----

[*From wikipedia:*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits)

&gt; * **Openness** to experience (inventive/curious vs. consistent/cautious)  
Appreciation for art, emotion, adventure, unusual ideas, curiosity, and variety of experience. Openness reflects the degree of intellectual curiosity, creativity and a preference for novelty and variety a person has. It is also described as the extent to which a person is imaginative or independent and depicts a personal preference for a variety of activities over a strict routine. High openness can be perceived as unpredictability or lack of focus, and more likely to engage in risky behaviour or drug taking. Also, individuals that have high openness tend to lean towards being artists or writers in regards to being creative and appreciate the significance of the intellectual and artistic pursuits. Moreover, individuals with high openness are said to pursue self-actualization specifically by seeking out intense, euphoric experiences. Conversely, those with low openness seek to gain fulfillment through perseverance and are characterized as pragmatic and data-driven‚Äîsometimes even perceived to be dogmatic and closed-minded. Some disagreement remains about how to interpret and contextualize the openness factor.

&gt;* **Conscientiousness** (efficient/organized vs. easy-going/careless)  
A tendency to be organized and dependable, show self-discipline, act dutifully, aim for achievement, and prefer planned rather than spontaneous behavior. High conscientiousness is often perceived as stubbornness and obsession. Low conscientiousness is associated with flexibility and spontaneity, but can also appear as sloppiness and lack of reliability.

&gt;* **Extraversion** (outgoing/energetic vs. solitary/reserved)  
Energy, positive emotions, surgency, assertiveness, sociability and the tendency to seek stimulation in the company of others, and talkativeness. High extraversion is often perceived as attention-seeking, and domineering. Low extraversion causes a reserved, reflective personality, which can be perceived as aloof or self-absorbed. Extroverted people tend to be more dominant in social settings, opposed to introverted people who may act more shy and reserved in this setting.

&gt;* **Agreeableness** (friendly/compassionate vs. challenging/detached)  
A tendency to be compassionate and cooperative rather than suspicious and antagonistic towards others. It is also a measure of one's trusting and helpful nature, and whether a person is generally well-tempered or not. High agreeableness is often seen as naive or submissive. Low agreeableness personalities are often competitive or challenging people, which can be seen as argumentativeness or untrustworthiness.

&gt;* **Neuroticism** (sensitive/nervous vs. secure/confident)  
Neuroticism identifies certain people who are more prone to psychological stress. The tendency to experience unpleasant emotions easily, such as anger, anxiety, depression, and vulnerability. Neuroticism also refers to the degree of emotional stability and impulse control and is sometimes referred to by its low pole, ""emotional stability"". A high stability manifests itself as a stable and calm personality, but can be seen as uninspiring and unconcerned. A low stability expresses as a reactive and excitable personality, often very dynamic individuals, but they can be perceived as unstable or insecure. It has also been researched that individuals with higher levels of tested neuroticism, tend to have worse psychological well being.

[*From a peer-reviewed paper:*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0191886996000335):

&gt;The NEO-PI Agreeableness score was correlated only with the thinking-feeling (T-F) dimension; the NEO-PI Conscientiousness score was correlated with both thinking-feeling and judging-perceiving (J-P) dimension; the NEO-PI Extraversion score was strongly correlated with the extraversion-introversion (E-I) dimensions, while the Neuroticism score from the NEO-PI was not related to any MBTI subscale score. The openness dimension was correlated with all four especially sensing-intuitive.",1521895565

Conservative

I think I am on the order of very extroverted. Very outspoken conservative I am very conservative. fundamental Christian, that‚Äôs the closest I could think of to describe Christianity. 

I live in California.

In recent weeks, I‚Äôve been viciously attacked in my political science class and a short time as the school‚Äôs political correspondent. As a 1w9 I feel I am a bit of a social changer, trying to perfect society, reform type of person. I am also very extroverted so I am not shy at all in voicing these views. My ISFJ teacher probably SP variant instict has been attacked too, but I feel more in danger because I loudly defend him and stand up for my views. It‚Äôs not like I can help it. I tell myself, not to, I semi-regret opening my mouth, but feel like I should. I open it or raise my hand naturally. 

If they were polite about things it would be different but these people are antagonistic, and on the attack. They get on my last nerves. I feel my 1w9 so and ESTJ just feels like speaking and telling them that their behavior is inappropriate. My SP stuff is arguing with that. I also currently fear my safety.

For example, last class, I went to drop a bunch of newspapers. A conversation started and I ended up lecturing them on what civil conversation and political debate was.

Any suggestions? If I was to be less opened about it how? What of my learnt urges to speak up, to give an opinion, debate, answer questions?

I also don‚Äôt get emotional, I feel like my FI has been triggered. Also,this type of situation make think I am some of introvert. I can upset and very to myself when I am not arguing with them or defending myself. I am like ultra cautious of myself, and don‚Äôt necessarily want to socialize. It‚Äôs pretty bad. I start feeling as if the world everyone could be like that. I also start to lose the ego in me. E.g. start to feel friendless, unappreciated, no one wants me. Ordinarily I am not like that.

Direct and linear in behavior and conversation. Can be sharp and categorical in his judgments, due to which accumulates many problems of ethical nature. At another end of extreme, he may not say anything, but later build up grudges and hard feelings, and avoid interaction.

ESTJ,"My boyfriend has taken the 16 personalities quiz 3 times in about two years, his most recent type was an ESTJ. The time before this he was an ENTJ and the first time was an ESTJ again.

In our relationship he makes most of the decisions but it will depend on the situation. He will often ask me for my input with certain things. He's good at getting tasks completed and is organised. He has big dreams for the future and where he wants to work.

We often disagree about some things as he is a traditionalist in that way whilst I don't really care what other people think or do in their life. He sometimes has short term goals that can be unrealistic and doesn't listen to my advice until he's gone and experienced it and then realizes I told him initially sort of thing. He's no afraid to talk about the future with me and that's why we clicked Initally as we both could see a future together. I find he doesn't laugh at all my jokes, which upon some reading makes him seem more like an ESTJ.

If we have a conversation with a stranger he will always ask me afterwards if he said anything wrong, as there have been times where he gets too confrontational but doesn't realise it. He often says things such as he doesn't know why some people don't like me as I am kind to everyone. He's also the one to say sorry a lot and learns from his mistakes. He is caring and kind to me but not overly emotional and I can insult him without him taking it too seriously.

In every test I've done I always end up an INTP but it confuses me a little. I can be scared of the future and often rely on past experiences to learn and I usually just live my life as each day comes, I just have an idea of the person I'd like to be in the future.

ESTJ,"Hey everyone! Hope you are well!!!

This was first posted in an eneagram forum, but I will try it too.

Firstly, I am properly a 1w9 but 3w4 is a second in tritype, and I think it‚Äôs rather high. My third is 6w7. I am also an ESTJ, Te si Ne FI.

I love to work. I do anything  , and everything. I say yes to a lot. I think I can do well on them, It catches my interest. Besides more to do, more to make perfect, get more credit, why not? Someone needs to do it. I am very enthusiastic. It really doesn‚Äôt feel like too much. I just feel busy. Like most 1w9 or 3w4s or eSTJs my schedule is over flowing. I work 3 events a week, and write articles for them. I am a student journalist. I have to interview and run over a ton for them. I am also on other leadership roles throughout my community, help to bridge the gap. I am doing of a lot of work building membership lists, tracking down people online. ETC.... I also take two other classes, have some work from last semester. I usually don‚Äôt burn out, but I think everyone has a limit. Occasionally I feel I do a little and then get back to work. If I get burnt  out I just do something efficient like come on here and help people. Not such a problem, right? Well, until.....

I start to not sleep, and fall asleep randomly. I am also a student, so I dose off at inopportune times like during lecture. It‚Äôs not boring. If I am awake I love debating and engaging. Listening to a lecture is less hands on and energetic then something else, and my body just shuts down then. It‚Äôs unfortunate, because I don‚Äôt really want to doze off! I also crash. Sleep for a long time. I also have to work until work is done. It also has to be to a very high standard. I also notice it, and as ESTJ and maybe it‚Äôs 1w9 and 3w4 it bothers me. when I start getting close to deadlines because I have to do this and that. If you write on at a university level if not a professional paper, you know one or 2 articles is a lot of work.. I also have to go classes, sleep, personal things, breathe, ETC..... I also try to keep up with people in between otherwise I feel kind of lonely just work and no connections. While messaging people may not be super long. So, I miss articles. Initially it doesn‚Äôt seem like a lot. I like working and keeping busy. So, I say yes, and do them. It‚Äôs natural for me to say yes. I feel like they would help my experience and my career. I like to cover those things because I should be the one covering them. I also pick up the leading because no one else wants to do it. Also, I take on tough articles. Some of these stuff fewer really wants to do. That‚Äôs another reason. I am a workaholic and I love work. I also like the perfection and the prestige of doing it. The goals, the success. It usually doesn‚Äôt feel like an issue. You just keep trucking right?

ESTJ,"Yes, we do exist!!

Friends often say I'm the smartest and most successful of the group. I own my own business and all that go-getter stuff. I could go on, but all you need to know is that I'm a tried and true ESTJ.

Smoking weed has definitely helped balance me out. Before, I couldn't STAND people who were overly emotional. If someone couldn't respond to logic, I'd find the most polite way to call them an idiot and move on. Lol like straight up. The thought of being friends what that kind of person wouldn't even cross my mind.

Now, I can actually stop and understand people's feelings. Sometimes, you have to allow people to feel emotional and you have to connect with them on that level before you can get them to see logic. This sort of statement would have many types saying, ""well duh...you JUST realized that?"". But ESTJ's don't naturally feel like that, it's something they have to learn. And when they do, it's usually because the ESTJ is playing an emotional endgame in order to get results out of someone, so the connection isn't exactly authentic. It's very rare to find an ESTJ who can genuinely relate to someone emotionally. I feel like I'm one of those, though. 

When I took the test high (as in answering questions that pertain to me while I'm stoned) I got INTP. Which made sense because I'd go from super extrovert to major introvert when I got stoned. I liked having conversations with people I knew, but I didn't like socializing with new ppl. That scared the shit out of me because my intelligence is a big part of who I am, and without that I felt like I couldn't be myself.

So I had to find another way to relate to people when I got stoned at parties. Finally I just told myself ""I might not be able to sound like my intelligent usual self...but I can make people feel good about themselves"". That's where this all began.

I've come to learn that making people feel good about themselves simply means shutting up and listening to them. Just letting them talk about whatever they want. Believe it or not, people don't wanna talk about politics or business. They don't wanna debate the intricacies of the stock market or of tax policy. Shocker, I know. 

Usually they wanna talk about THEMSELVES. About what they did last weekend, how it felt when they did activity X and Y. 

But in order to really know someone, you can't just listen to them all the time. You've gotta give them a piece of yourself too. And that's where everything changed for me.

I realized that I had to give myself the space to EXPLORE MY OWN FEELINGS. You'll have to figure out how to do that on your own. But what helped me was going on long drives down the coast, being around nature, listening to music... All things I did while I was high. I can listen to music for hours when I'm high and I'll never get tired of it. Like that alone is an activity for me. No way I'm doing that when I'm sober lol.

Every weekday night I drive to the beach, get high and listen to the evening news in my car while watching the sunset. It's interesting because I'm still doing an ESTJ activity, I'm still listening to the news. But I try to surround myself around something beautiful so that I can learn how to open up my heart to it-- something that I DID NOT KNOW how to do previously. But I'm trying. And I've learned that just as real as any fact or statistic can be, a glimmering sunset or a good song can be equally just as real. Again, so many other types would shake their heads reading this...it seems like such common sense. But I'm glad that it happened to me this way. You can either be an emotional person trying to find logic in this world...or you can be a logical person trying to find emotion in this world. I'd rather be the latter because an emotional person is learning logic to survive, whereas a logical person is learning emotion in order to find new meaning in life. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I finally found what I'd been missing all along, I just had to have a reason to look for it.

ESTJ,"A little creative writing to kick things off.

When tying the knot of your reality together, first you must acknowledge your hands as if they were never used such a task.
 
(I know ""as if they were never used such a task"" doesn't make sense but my reason for keeping it is that maybe estj's have a grammatical blind spot, no need to try to fill in the part with a system that wasn't built by me -- language, words.) 


In the back of your mind you know you'll never get the whole picture together, because you always suspect more. What ""more"" is there? You've found 100% of the things you've found. What's brought me to this point was a certain level of curiosity toward fulfillment of mapping it all together. But starting with no topic to branch from, from the beginning of everything I guess my intuition felt the best place was to start right where I was, which was a clueless middle of nowhere on the sea of consciousness. 

This was written before I knew about MBTI or my type. I had been thinking about starting a collection of my own writings or mappings of reality. I envisioned having a giant collection of my own self-enquired knowledge, sort of like how the ancient sages may have began writing what they knew for no other sake than having a tangible relationship to their own relationship with reality to observe and analyze. Let's face it, ESTJ's knowledge is leading up toward something huge and we feel like we've already got it, somehow... but as a metaphor, just lying in a field of infinity and looking up at the passing clouds will never be a suitable way to get the accumulation of our attention together. If I want to become as solid as a tree, with reality, existence, and attention as my nutrition, I need to synthesize by doing something like record keeping, practicing, getting it right, but not for the sake of making ""the big picture"", but for the sake of knowing ""damn, I really have a lot of knowledge at the end of it all."" We're like modern sages, each and every human being. I learned recently that what distinguishes humans from many other animals is that we live well beyond the end of our reproductive time frame. Many animals die as they leave their reproductive fertility. Human DNA has somehow, maybe by coincidence, kept old people alive so they could pass on knowledge to the newer generations. Before writings, there were words, before words, we weren't ""wise-monkeys"" humans. MY CLAIM IS NOW THAT IN THE ESTJ CONSCIOUSNESS LIES THE POWER OF ALL SUBJECTIVELY ACQUIRED ACCUMULATED WISDOM. The first smart monkey was an istp :) The human race can thank us later, let's just figure out how to end all wars and starvation first.

She knew I had just found the money
I'm thinking about the money, as I hold it in my hands
My first reaction was to share the money with her
But I held on
My second reaction was to look away from her direction because I felt awkward
I'm looking down at the money in my hands 
I observe and observe and observe
I think and I think and I think
Should I give it to a homeless person
Should I buy some homeless persons food
Should I save it for myself

14 dollars could come in handy
The ten dollar bill began to speak to me
It said I'm in hell 
5 stops later
I'm still agonizing over what to do with the money
I began to think what if I had just flicked the money over so I could sit down
Maybe I would of had peace
Then I think maybe this is why humanity is in hell 
Money funds hell

I have proposed an act for myself
I will throw the money away in the trash can in the subway
I get off the train

I don't why I'm anxious but I am
I lift my hand over the trash can
I drop the money in the trash can as if it was trash
I don't know if anyone behind me noticed
There were about 20 people walking behind me
I leave the station
I'm walking as if I had done something selfless

ESTJ,"How do you feel about INTPs and ENTPs?

The reason is I had issues with ESTJs growing up in elementary school. It was a communication issue, but my Ti had trouble justifying my Ne, and I wasn‚Äôt given knowledge that was actually useful for me.

When I did something my way (e.g. the way I formed my letters), I‚Äôd do it in an unorthodox way and do it based on my Ne. The ESTJ teacher would, in short, assert her Si on me and pretty much say (not word for word necessarily) ‚ÄúDo things the traditional way!‚Äù We‚Äôd go back and forth until the teacher would just give up and think I was being stubborn.

The other reason is, no offense, but I feel like I‚Äôm around ‚Äúold‚Äù people when around/see the ESTJs I‚Äôve been around/seen, although that could just be the ESTJs I see/have to spend time with.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

The other thing that I tend to have issues with with ESTJs is they (based on the ones I‚Äôve been around) tend to be misinformed and indoctrinated.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

It‚Äôs not so much that I have a problem with ESTJs nor Si even but the effects of the manipulation of Si. 

Since people aren‚Äôt educated on psychology nor sociology, nor have a good understanding of science, TREMENDOUS problems occur. In fact, I think many major problems in society would be fixed if this were fixed.

Hi! I‚Äôm a student from Seneca College doing a small research study for my major on the connection between personality and the amount of text that people post online. If you have a few minutes to fill out this survey (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdECFEzijDjqQAM4swbns4rWZM6mG38xFKZjoJpsUnVED_ThA/viewform?usp=sf_link) I would be very grateful!

The survey is a Big Five inventory that will give me some personality information. I ask for your username so I can run it through Reddit‚Äôs API in Python to get your comment history, but after associating it with your score I will DELETE YOUR USERNAME and will NOT use it in any way in connection with your comment history. I am also only going to look at usage information from a distance, like how many comments you have over what time period and how many words you average per comment. The reason I need your username is so I can connect a score to a comment history so I can look at that meta-information, but everything will be kept totally anonymous!

My goal for now is just to look at correlations, but maybe I could eventually build this out into a cool analyzer tool like this: https://atomiks.github.io/reddit-user-analyser/

I know an ESTJ who constantly has to physically see things for themselves. This comes in multiple forms:

* Whether something would fit inside another thing (even if it looks like it wouldn't fit at all)

* Scoping stores for items that, imho, obviously wouldn't be found there just in case it is

* Doing something someone else has already done just to verify

I concede that the last one is because the ESTJ probably believes they might know a better way to do something, but the constant verification can be frustrating. At the very least it wastes time and at most I'm constantly being doubted.

ESTJ,"I've been consistently tested as an INTJ since I first took the test several years ago, the result being the same on all the tests I've taken from 16Personalities, to the HumanMetrics, to John's Test, and to Keys2Cognition. For the years since I first took the test, I was satisfied with the INTJ typing as the description seemed to suit me well. However, I've recently began doubting this as I've began doing more investigations into other types. 

Most recently, I've been categorized as an xNTJ by PersonalityJunkie. In accordance with that, I've been compared many times with ENTJ characters from popular media, and they are often my favorite characters to watch as I tend to relate to them quite a bit. Having been praised throughout my life for my ability to lead, being told I'm ""remarkably persuasive and charismatic"" (something from a friend), and I have this deep motivation for bettering myself and the world around me. I sympathize greatly with ENTJ characteristic of mastering myself and my environment quickly, knowing that I'm in control of those things gives me comfort; feeling like I'm 'going with the flow' of another person's lead makes me uncomfortable. I tend to be a bit theatrical when expressing something I'm excited about, being animated and enunciating my words in a particular and deliberate way, but if my point is misunderstood or rejected without a good reason I can become blunt and insensitive to others, and I know that. It just feels necessary to be blunt in situations such as that. People can also become discomforted by my commanding presence when I'm expressing an idea I've thought about for a long time. Still I hold a strong love for individualism as a concept that I've evaluated on a deeper level, and deemed to be the best way of thinking from a rational point of view. I'm very much both a rational and psychological egoist. Striving only for a reasonable and logical framework to operate in, which collects an abundance of information and then converges toward a single way of doing things through inner deductive reasoning, being harsh and honest with myself by excluding any external influences. I strive to find some universal way of doing things instead of relying on multiple points of view. Furthermore I'm highly self-confident and self-motivated to make the world a better place for others and myself. I don't like being instructed on how to do things and prefer learning it on my own. Making it my own, if you will. 

The INTP typing is more interesting, but I feel less likely than the ENTJ. Mostly because I've been praised as exceptionally mature emotionally and in my way of thinking over the years and tend to prefer single conclusions and a set of well-defined rules formed through assembling my own complex set of ideas, created independently in my mind. In part, I feel that I have a well developed sense of introverted thinking, or at least I'd like to think so. Assessing all the parts of a concept, asking INTP questions such as ""Why does that happen?"" ""How does it work? ""Why is it this way?"" and so on and so forth to develop a deeply rational approach to everything. However, it unequivocally returns to the question of ""How can I apply this to make people understand it?"" or ""How can I use this?"" In a more -NTJ fashion. I do love the experience of learning for its own sake, but it has to be useful to me by either adding to a pre-existing foundation that is rational, or by breaking that one pre-existing one down and contributing to some new foundation. 

As a review, my major characteristics, as I see them, are these:

‚Ä¢Care for the improvement of both myself and the world around me.

‚Ä¢Known to have a commanding presence

‚Ä¢Called charismatic and persuasive


‚Ä¢Very confident in my own abilities 

‚Ä¢Quite capable of, and enjoys, leading a group toward a particular goal; Leadership is something I'm eager to take up and feel very comfortable in.

‚Ä¢Always keeping in mind some goal or idea for the future of what is the best and most efficient way of doing things

‚Ä¢Zero tolerance for emotional or arbitrary justifications (such as irrational traditions or perceptions); will only listen to arguments based in reason

‚Ä¢Almost always the leader of a conversation when I do interact with others, holding the attention on myself and driving the conversation toward particular points

‚Ä¢Willing to listen to other perspectives so long as they are rational.

‚Ä¢The knowledge I gather has to have some application which is useful to me, either personally in the pursuit of knowledge for its own usefulness, or in the workplace where I can use it to refine or reform my present strategies or approaches. I'm able to adapt to changes if a new idea is better or more efficient than the current one. 

‚Ä¢Tend to spend a lot of time alone, pondering new ideas or refining old ones that I've developed independent of external influences. 

‚Ä¢Long-term planner, usually with a single, flexible, and complex plan. Knowing exactly how to reach the goal I want to. Not concerned particularly with any one part, but more how the sum of the total amount of parts interact with each other to create the exact function I want. In business this takes the form of stock market investment, a high paying career, efficient management of finances, and capitalizing on my confidence, charisma and calculating nature to reach new heights at a rapid pace.

‚Ä¢Hold myself to a certain integrity or code of honest.

‚Ä¢Creator of my own set of well-defined rules that have been endured the process of being ripped apart by my way of thinking and tested as being rational and legitimate; doesn't like disorder, uncertainty, or arbitrariness in how things are run. Everything needs to point toward one particular goal.

‚Ä¢Fiercely independent and can become discontent or even antagonistic toward a particular way of doing something if it is inefficient or significantly flawed.

My strongest function has almost always been my iNtuiton, never dropping below 50% over the years, while my Introversion has been the weakest, never going above 30% on any metrics. I have a tendency to sit back and zone out deep in thought often if the current conversation bores me or I just have time alone to do so. Connecting not only to the philosophy I'll mention here as well, but also to the supposedly crude/dark sense of humor seen in Ni types. I have a dark sense of humor and can be sarcastic too. I have a vivid image of who i want to be and where I'd like to be. Which is either being extremely wealthy, living alone, spending a lot of free time studying or writing, and having connections in elite circles, or alternatively pursuing a career in politics by transforming the playing field and striving toward my vision of the most desirable society I see in my mind. I also see everything as being connected in a rational way, often achieved through my passion for philosophy and particularly with metaphysics, free will, ethics, and mind. I also have a strong skepticism to me. Lastly, while I am confident and charasmatic, I have a penchant for sticking to the back of a room and thinking before I speak. Sometimes not at all if it isnt that important. I deliberately set myself apart from the group. Im currently in college, and i sit at empty tables both in class and in the dining hall by choice normally, and prefer talking to the people next to me or small groups usually with a focus on philosophical, political, organizational, or general interests. I tend to be much more assertive when expressing an idea though. Can even be theatrical in the presentation of a grand vision I have. I'm competitive in that I see debates as a testing of both mind and will, and find that experience to be exciting.

ESTJ,"I am going to be a bit sentimental, I'm sorry in advance!

Yesterday, in a pretty confused state, I wrote this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ESTJ/comments/71omwi/dating_question_to_estj_men/) about going on dates with this ESTJ. And you guys gave me good feedback. 

To summarize the post - I hit it off with this ESTJ guy, who was sincere, sweet, and very expressive. It was very obvious we both felt the click. We kissed on all three dates. However, he wouldn't initiate or send a text after each of our dates. You guys gave me good feedback, mostly saying that the ESTJ is definitely interested, and ESTJs aren't usually good at texting/small talk. It made sense, so I just took the advice.

Today, I found out that in the last three days, he's changed his pictures on a dating profile. This indicated to me that he's actually not looking for anything serious with me. 

I was actually devastated. I know it's only been three dates, but the connection was great and mutual (unless I am totally fooling myself). 

I guess I'm just venting because I've never done ""casual dating"" myself where I get physical with a man but look for other men at the same time. It sucks to know that whatever I had with this guy, he was probably not very serious about.

Anyway, just wanted to vent. Would love to hear any feedback/words/comments... I'm a sappy sad gal tonight.",1506140174

Recently I met another ESTJ man, with whom I had an instant romantic connection with. It was obvious he was attracted as well since he was really engaged in the convo, went for a kiss several times during our first date, etc. He's 32, I'm 31.

We met twice more after the first date. He was equally very caring and expressive in his interest. Unless I'm fooling myself, I'm pretty sure our interest is mutual. 

The problem is that he's kind of a... ""out of sight, out of mind"" type. While our dates are REALLY good, he never texts or calls first after these dates!

I initiated texting twice now and already getting sick of it. When I text him first, he does reply relatively promptly. He asks to hang out, too. But again, after we hang out, texts drop. He doesn't intiate, basically.

ESTJ men - does this mean he's just not that into me?

There is an ESTJ who keep asking me for advice. He is a foreign born and isn't confident in his English, and I helped with his grammar in an essay one time (b/c I felt bad for him). 

But now he keeps on asking me again and again for help, it's now going extreme -everything from essay writing to letter writing to interview advice to even social etiquette. It's way too overwhelming - I spent over 30 hours talking to him about all this! I should seriously be paid for helping this much. I can't reject him because technically we are ""friends"", but it really is too much. 

He isn't very considerate of my time commitments either. I even told him once I can speak to him BRIEFLY about something, but he still ended up discussing with me for 50 minutes. In the middle I kept reiterating ask me later, I can talk to you about this some more after I'm not so busy.  But he STILL didn't get the message, and kept on fixating on his details.

ESTJ,"I may be something of a unique situation here, I'm an ESTJ (Phew! Can finally say it!) raised by an ENFP mother, and probably surrounded by other feelers (dad and bro, both Fi driven fosure!) who had such an influence from his mother, that when he tested ENFP the first time he took the test, like a true ESTJ continued to identify with the ""ENFP"" all his life since (at least a decade), to the point that he Googled ""ENFP"" and wrote down the points listed under personalitypage's Strengths/Weaknesses when he had to list them out for his first job interview, I still remember them (Strives for Win-Win situations, which I thought was the awesomest part of the ENFP),

and like a true ESTJ made ENFP and intuitive friends with whom he always felt like he was more grounded, not really ""like the others"", but the ENFP profile said that ""they are rare"", and they ""feel different from the crowd"" (something on those lines), well that must be why. Especially the former, ENFPs, they flocked to him, and he bossed them around, with love and practicality ""You have such a strong Te"" they said with bunny eyes and such innocent faith in the claimed MBTI result,

until well he finally began to realize that something was REALLY off, that he was getting along with sensors, better, wanted a traditional wife, valued family, friends, and society, was FAR too stable and grounded, and practical, and began to seriously study the types, until Si led depression (heart break, inability to forgive harshness of self) led him to pursue Astrology for a year and a half, all day, everyday, until he could remember everything, and probably predict your chart just by looking at you (no seriously I will need your details, but I have done it TWICE) because he one day wondered, while dope high (only respite during trying times, after a hard day at work) if the moon could raise the seas, can it not affect us?
was convinced by an ENFP friend that he was NOT an ESTJ because she didn't say so, and like a true ESTJ, began to think he was indeed an ENFP with too strong Te, SHOULD develop DAT Fi, spent the Astrology year trying to IDENTIFY self, blamed everyone for nothing, and became a 5 year old (3 as per some estimates) for the next year and a half, DESPITE astrology telling him the SAME thing - Dude your Te SO HIGH, it goes outside this software.

until he convinced himself he was an ENTP till last night, took a test on Values (by psychology today), and for the umpteenth time scored HIGH on social, traditional, theoretical, and realistic values.
So ladies and gentlemen, as a fully realized ESTJ who can safely say he was on the other side and beyond, hello!

I've been friends for 4 years with my guy friend. (ESTJ) Within the last year, we have started seeing each other--we don't exactly have that bf/gf label. Neither one of us is seeing anyone else but we just haven't gotten around to the talk of being committed. He is always so busy but any down time he has, he spends it with me and helps me when I need anything. I know he cares about me extremely, he shows it and I hear ESTJs show they care with actions, which he does. But at what point, do they just openly say it?

I honestly think I have reached the point that I can say those 3 words. But, I also don't want to make it uncomfortable because I don't want him to tense up and close up or push me away. Aren't ESTJs uncomfortable with that type of stuff? We also haven't sat down and confirmed our relationship so I don't want that to be a factor somehow. 

When does the ""I love you"" come around?

ESTJ,"Why do ESTJs either go silent or say they need silence and seclusion when they are mad or stressed? Can you articulate what youre feeling inside or what is going through your head when youre doing/requesting this? I noticed when my boyfriend gets mad, angry, stressed, or faces a challenge with some negative context he closes me out--even when i am not a source of the stress. He used to just go silent and act like i was not speaking or in the room but i could see the wheels turning in his head, now that we understand our boundaries better i find he is articulating that he needs to be alone in a silent space when he gets overwhelmed, we just dont talk about why. He usually makes me so high anxiety when hes in this kind of mood that i understand its best to just shut up and go about my business until he has worked through whatever. When hes over it its like it never happened and hes already moved on with his life. I cant help asking why this is or whats going on inside the mind of the estj, because i respect boundaries better when i understand why those boundaries are there. Case in point: tonight. He has a roommate that he does not get along with and who is particularly mean to my animal whom my boyfriend watches when im away on long business trips. He mentioned on the phone tonight that the animals things had been touched but did not say anything more to elaborate. I asked if he wanted me to come back a day earlier and get her so we didnt have to worry about it, and he declined since his roommate hit my animal earlier this week, resulting in my boyfriend threatening to kick him out and has since installed a motion activated recorder in the direction of the animals things. I continued the conversation thinking it was fine because he hadnt said otherwise, but from that point on the conversation faded, his responses got quiet and one-worded, he mumbled something about going back to living alone, and then said he needed to hang up because he needed silence and seclusion to relax. I knew he was not mad at me, and that it likely was the roommate, but he declined to wanting to talk it out even though it involved my animal which made me uneasy. I respected his wishes and hung up because i could feel how tense he was through the phone. I just want to know what the heck is going on in his head when he shuts down and shuts out.

ESTJ,"http://www.celebritytypes.com/estj-description.php

I've read a lot of type descriptions for ESTJs, and this one seems to be the best for me. It cuts out on the stuff I usually disagree with [""ESTJs hate being proven wrong and other people's ideas"" ""ESTJs hate any abstract concept"" ""ESTJs are hardcore traditionalists""], and adds more depth to the ESTJ character than most sites do. There were parts of the description that gave me a hearty laugh because they were just so accurate to me. I feel like xSTJs, and to a lesser extent, Sensors in general, are kind of shat all over when it comes to type descriptions, so this made me very happy to read.

Parts I particularly agreed with:

&gt; Even though ESTJs are extroverts, they can often be a bit more reserved than the other E types. They tend to enjoy talking and engaging others, but can oftentimes struggle with situations where there are no logical parameters to grab hold of, or where emotional self-expression is expected of them.

&gt; They tend to view everything in an impersonal manner, even themselves to some extent

&gt; They tend to dislike ambiguity and unresolved states that drag on for too long, and can at times evince a preference for simply committing to some decision or applying whatever solution that's on hand now instead of waiting indefinitely for a slightly better one. 

&gt; The irony is that most ESTJs actually appreciate it when someone drills down with them to discover the best solution. In their minds, it is reasonable to expect that if someone is sitting on a better solution, he or she should speak up and push back a little and not just sit there holding their tongue.

&gt; ESTJs often have a dry and cutting sense of humor, where they make an art form out of stating the plain truth in an exacting, yet tongue-in-cheek way. 

&gt; Deep down, most ESTJs know that they are more logical and objective than most and that forcing others to live up to their own high standards would very often just end in tears.

&gt; ESTJs can also often be counted on to break the ice or alleviate tensions in awkward situations.

&gt; It can sometimes be daunting for others to feel that they have to evince these qualities around the ESTJ, but on the other hand, many of those same people will often feel a sense of reassurance with an ESTJ at the helm of whatever they are doing.",1503227764

ESTJ,"**ESTJ, Self-Preservation 8w7**

I receive this typing often but those who've typed me don't know that I break some big stereotypes / have some characteristics which most ESTJs don't possess

**Bossy, controlling, natural leader**

I'm good at leading / managing ppl but I don't always want to lead unless I know I'll excel (ie if I suck at biology I won't lead a group project). When I lead I'm not bossy / controlling I just get things done quickly and efficiently

**Blunt and confrontational**

I'm aware of what's rude so I don't have the tendency to say things that can offend others. I'm not all that straight forward to prevent drama. I don't confront / get into conflict with ppl Idk often bc I'm uncomfortable arguing with ppl Idk unless it's online. I believe not confronting others is mainly due to appearance insecurities bc I'm quite confrontational and open to conflict online

**Sensitive to criticism**

I'm often described as defensive bc ppl will say something that wasn't meant to be rude but I'd take it the wrong way and get pissed. Criticism doesn't make me sad it just makes me really mad. I believe this is due to narcissism

**Easily stressed**

ESTJs are stereotyped to be very high achieving and can handle working a lot but I get stressed easily and frequently. I find myself most stressed when I can't get things done quickly and have time to relax

**Lazy, slightly hedonistic**

I get all my work done but I just put in enough effort to barely get As. I have all As but I don't take honors or advanced classes bc I want to do little work and enjoy life. Though I want to enjoy life I still take obligations seriously

**Comfortable with my emotions**

ESTJ,"Hi Reddit,

Looking for some guidance here. My ESTJ boyfriend pretty much tries to initiate sex every time we're together. I spent this last  6 days with him, and we were intimate 4 out of the 6. He asked me if I wanted to have sex the day I was leaving, but I said no because I had a 2 hour drive ahead of me and didn't want to get home late. He was very bothered and hurt by ""the way"" I said it... I guess. We had a long convo about it, but this seems to be a reoccurring issue. I love him, but I don't like being touched sexually all the time & it's something I've communicated to him. He's receptive... but idk. I could be wrong, but from what I've read, you ESTJs tend to show your love in an intimate manner. Any tips on how to balance your needs? I'd really appreciate it. He says that he feels like he gets ""it"" less and less from me over time. It's partially true, but that's because we're moving out of the honeymoon phase.... but I still feel bad and try to give him as much as I feel able to. Even when I'm not in the mood at all. 

Thanks guys.",1501795495
ESTJ,"A lot of people will agree that humans should have complete control over their own bodies while they are alive. How about after death? Is it better to use those bodies (for organ donation etc.) for the benefit of the living?

Should there be an opt-out instead of opt-in for organ donation? How about in tricky situations where the person died really early before deciding?",1501731670
ESTJ,"Hello dear ESTJ's. I'm an INTP man married to an ESTJ woman. We are having a lot of problems in our marriage and sometimes it seems like we just don't understand each other. Could you guys help? Any and all information would be greatly appreciated. In particular: what makes you most happy in a partner? What annoys you? If anyone is in a relationship with an INTP, how does that work out? What do they do that's great? What could improve? 

It often seems like my wife wants me to behave in a certain way, but it's never clear what that way is. It's almost like she expects me to follow some hidden script that she has in her mind. Does this ring any bells? Is there some particular code that I'm supposed to follow?

Any and all advice would be appreciated. Thanks!",1501705026

ESTJ,"Hey ESTJ's,

I know an ESTJ - he has strong Te and Si vibes about him, which makes me think he is one. 

I am a ISFJ who helped him with a task beforehand and I think he really appreciated it. 

Now I am in a situation where I need his assistance with something. I only asked him for advice, wasn't expecting much out of it. 

BUT, I was blown away by the help he gave me. He is more experienced than me by many years. He actually started to ""mentor"" me, he started to check up on me 2x a week to see how I was performing. He told me all these tactics for me to succeed. He even checked up on my performance (he actually went into the files to read my work), and said I'm doing well, and gave me a lot of encouragement. I wasn't even expecting for him to help me out this much.

Also, what's even weird is he often mixes these mentoring sessions with very personal stories about his past that he hasn't told to anyone else about his previous working experience and revealed some very personal intentions/thoughts/emotions.

Is this normal or what?
Do you ESTJs normally like to mentor people?


I thought ESTJ were ""the executive"" and suppose to be cold.
But this guy was receptive to helping me out, and also gushing out inner thoughts/emotional things to me, man I don't know what to make of this lol.

ESTJ,"So I'm strongly inclined to believe I used to be an ESTP when I was younger. I was a troublemaker in school  would hate any rules imposed on me and just did whatever I wanted when I wanted. I was all about partying and drugs for awhile. One day I had a near death experience because I overdosed and it forever changed me. I realized that life is more fragile than I initially thought and there was definitely a very high likelihood I could have died that night. I made a conscious effort to not be so reckless all the time. This is when I think I started developing my ""J"" .I planned every little detail of everything. I made sure to be alot more cautious about what I put into my body. Eventually this also went over into all facets of my life and became alot more organized. I got my act together and eventually attained financial stability and then some. However, there are times when I feel I really miss being a ""P"". because I feel I was alot happier.  At the same time, I remember the pain in the ass I was to my parents and don't know if I'd wanna go back. Altough I'm alot more successful now as a ""J"", I know suffer from mild depression that I never once experienced as a ""p"". What are your thoughts on this? Also, did anyone else think they were a different type at one point?",1500084786

As an INFJ, I know I try my best to be considerate of others feelings... but he doesn't always think so. I'm not really sure how to recognize when my words are hurtful or ""mean"" (as he would put it) either because I really am just being myself.

Luckily, I am able to tell when he's bothered, and we have great communication so that helps... but I'm still bothered by the fact that he thinks I'm ""mean.""

ESTJ,"So i'm a year younger than my ESTJ and he just graduated and is going to college(i'm an ENFP), i will graduate next year. We've both always had an attraction to eachother even though we didn't talk. We were both in relationships during school but whenever he was in the hall I knew it and would always make eye contact with him. I knew he found me attractive but i thought that was it. fast forward to when we both break up with our significant others, he texted me telling me he wanted to hook up, well i did too but i was having many issues with my ENTP ex, so we left it at that. a month after that we started talking again and ended up hooking up. Since then he's been extremely sweet, showering me with compliments and telling me that he's attracted to everything about me, how he wishes we could go to college together, when i graduate i have to hit him up, how he will take me to new york one day, and stuff like that. The reason we aren't dating right now is because he said he doesn't want to get attached before he leaves for college.  Yet we never hangout, he will say he misses me a stuff, but he only ever asks to hangout at night. I don't know, i guess i just don't know what to expect. I feel like how he says he's feeling can't be real and I don't know if he's being serious when he talks about a future between us. Is ESTJ just having fun for the summer? ",1499491158

ESTJ,"I'm an INFJ and I've never been able to settle into a faith - probably because I got burned by drinking the Kool-Aid in a fringe spiritual community in my early adulthood and could never trust a group again.

I feel that, in turn, conservative religious people don't trust me when they sense my lack of official alignment.  But I can't lie and go along with something if I'm not actually 100% on board, even if it would be to my advantage socially.  I've had very meaningful personal experiences that I'd call mystical, but they're quite abstract and I keep them to myself.  The resulting ethic is to experience and respect the indwelling divinity in all beings as much as I'm able, which I don't explain to people; I just do it.

How do ESTJs experience religion?  Is it more about the other people in your religious community, the laws or commandments set down, the subjective experience of grace/redemption/sacredness, or other?  I ask because I realized that I use nothing but feeling and intuition, and have no idea how a person could relate to the ineffable using the other functions; yet I understand that your religion could be the most important thing in your life.",1498515315

ESTJ,"Hey everyone! Given the small number of posters here, I'm only vaguely hopeful I'll get a response, but it's worth a shot to see what the ESTJ hivemind can tell me. 

I'm an ENTP woman. I've been married to my ESTJ husband for about 10 years. 

We've been, in very stereotypical fashion, arguing about his driving for a loooong time. Years even. He's an insanely aggressive driver. If someone is going slower than he wants to go, it's not just that he has to pass them, but he has to do it with this super over-the-top ""I'll teach you a lesson!"" flourish of speeding up dramatically and then nearly cutting them off. He's constantly gesturing at people, flashing lights at them, tailgating, speeding up to prevent people from changing lanes, laying on the horn if someone doesn't change lanes fast enough. It's like he has to correct everyone on the road, but his version of correcting them is terrifying everyone around him, including his lovely wife (me). 

I know what you're going to say. ""Why don't you just drive if he's so bad?"" The problem with that is twofold: 1) He insists on driving; 2) When I drive (and I am objectively a far safer driver than he is) he badgers me about my driving style constantly, I think in an effort to get me back for my comments on his (actually terrifying) driving. Sometimes I grin and bear it and do the driving anyway, but it's not a solution for when I'm not in the car with him or when he really does need/want to do the driving. 

Anyway, after years of telling him his driving was problematic, he finally got pulled over and summoned to traffic court for which we had to hire a lawyer and pay about $1,000. I felt like after this experience, he had finally realised that his driving is not okay. And for a brief moment, he seemed to change. 

But now he's back to his old ways. I've tried appealing to his sense of moral duty by telling him what he's doing is breaking several traffic laws and if he gets pulled over again they'll take his license. I've tried telling him it scares me and makes me worried for my safety and his. I tell him it makes him less attractive. I've told him that he can't control everyone's behaviour on the road and to focus on himself not others. I've tried not saying anything. I've threatened to call the police on him. I'm seriously at my wits end. 

What would resonate with you guys that I haven't already tried? And, like... are you guys all this obstinate and focused on correcting other people? I've noted this need to correct is a theme, not just in the driving, but in a lot of other areas of his behaviour. Sometimes it's good and makes sense, other times it results in crazy terrifying manic driving. ",1497893857

ESTJ,"I think I am an ESTJ.  At work, I always have to have the last word and my way is the only way.  I am well respected and my colleagues always come to me for help or advice.  But I easily get into fights and arguements with clients when they don't see my point of view.  I regularly have dealings with people that end up becoming heated and I really don't like myself for it.  Sometimes, I have discussions with people and I am really assertive about my point of view, and when I walk away, I think ""why on earth did you end up doing that? It was stupid"".

People accuse me of being disrespectful towards them and I am really not, I just don't share their point of view and if I think something is wrong or isn't being done right, I really can't stand it.  I have to correct things if I think they're wrong.

I often drive home from work thinking ""You've done it this time Reg, you're really in trouble as you have really pissed someone off and they will complain"".

I was wondering if anyone else who identifies as an ESTJ can suggest a coping strategy to help me to stop and take a moment to think before I speak to people and deal with them in a way where we can agree to disagree rather than pissing them off? I need to be needed when I am a work and I do like helping my coworkers with my knowledge, but I just can't deal reasonably without people when I don't feel that they share my objectives or methodology.",1496836424
ESTJ,"Hey there, hope you don't mind me attempting to pick your brains for a minute - I got good participation levels from other MBTI groups so I thought I'd extend it to all groups and try to get a more representative sample. FYI - the study is not collecting personality type information.

My dissertation for my masters in psychology is looking into one possible explanation for avoidance behaviours in forming intimate relationships. If you are 20-35yo and keen to contribute to my study then you can do so by following the link below. Any questions give me a shout, also I'm happy to discuss and hear your thoughts on the subject off the record if you want! It should't take too long but you're free to stop at any point anyway. It may cause some emotional distress as it involves some self evaluation so if you experience any discomfort and would like some guidance please get in touch.

I will leave the survey open until the end of this week.

ESTJ,"So I have this difficult guy who claims to be ESTJ. He does this kind of shit all of the time. He'll call me and when I pick up he's singing a random song. Or he gives me really vague responses to my very specific questions. Or he just ignores my messages entirely.

This afternoon I messaged him that I was going to speak English when I felt like I needed to be understood. (His English is perfect, my French is not, yet he doesn't like it when I speak in English.) I sent ""walls of text"" to explain myself after he yet again suggested I should speak to him in French.

A few hours later he sends me this message (it was all in French I've translated for you guys)

ESTJ: Do you drink bourbon?

Me: I drink everything.

ESTJ: That wasn't my question :|

I've been smoking 1-4 cigs for the 3 months, and I can feel myself become more and more addicted. 
I smoke for these reasons:

1. It's nice to have to roll a cig, it's really fun to roll a fine ciggarte, I like to also grind my tobbacco so it fits really nice!

2. It's a nice addition to my routine, I like to prepare myself breakfast, and before eating and watching an episode of a show, I *smoke* and drink my *tea* while listening to *music* and *observing nature* outside my apartment. CHILL AS FUCK!

ESTJ,"I am a 21 years old male from Israel.

My dad left my family when I was 13-14, and my mom raised with a very stricken system. At a certain point when I was growing up through puberty I rebelled. Stopped going to school as often, stopped doing most of my school-work.  Focused mainly on Video games, that was my escape. I made it my life's mission to be a competitive gamer.

I became 18, joined the army, which was really great for a year, until I realized I have no future in it, I havn't finished school, my social IQ\tact was horrible, I had no experience with women, I had no idea who I am, and I can keep going..

Too many problems to stay at the army, so I rebelled, faked depression, got out. Started going out with my high-school friends again, last 2 years I have been going out almost constantly. I've made a TON of progress.

I got really close to 2 of them, they're both American and because my English was always good(I've been told by many Americans that I sound slightly American and neutral), I just always felt safe and secure around Americans. I've made them like my family I hang around at they're house almost constantly, I've had days where I didn't go home. They're mom kind of adopted me as her pseudo-son(she calls me that xD). 

It made me feel good like I finally had that one constant thing in my life.. until I learned that I have been crossing some borders, I jokingly made a comment ""Why don't I have my own drawer?"", and later on I had a talk to them and I didn't know but i've been pushing too much. They told me they accept me and it is all alright but I should remember I don't live actually live there, there are certain borders(which I hate..), and they also mentioned there have been too many people by their house and their mom likes her privacy..

This made me feel so horrible T_T. I never meant to do any harm and I honestly felt like it was okay. I realized I've been looking for a family that wouldn't judge and hurt me (unlike my family..), and they've been that for so long.. 

I feel sad and lonely again.. and in that despair I've decided to give them some time without me. I think this might've been kind of a rush decision which sucks.

Just wanted to get this off my chest, and hopefully feel less lonely..

Last thing and this is a big one is that I havn't been appreciating their mom at all, after all it's their house and she has been nothing but sweet to me. recently a little cold. and I think that's because I've taken her for granted, without ever showing enough appreciation.
