ISTJ,my mom is an infp while im an intj or istj (not really sure yet). weve always been pretty cool but i never really liked affection and let her know that early on lol,1617466525

ISTJ,"I have an INFP sister, so I can kind of get where this is coming from. As a few others said, be as direct as possible and maybe don't try and get her to read between the lines. I think I can safely say that my sister has a better relationship with me than with anyone else in our family, despite the fact that sometimes I have to push her (gently) to get stuff done.  It can definitely work, and I wish you luck in your endeavor. üòä",1617464258

ISTJ,"I get what you mean, I'm an istj and my sister's an infp, what makes our relationship successful on my side is trying to go easy on her and respecting her sensitivity and deep thoughts, as well as being open to her physical affection and not pushing her away. What makes it successful on her side, is being understanding of the fact that we're not similar and respecting that I need my space and respect, along with being kind despite me not giving her the same energy. In short words, understanding and cooperation is key, you'll have your ups and downs 100%, but you and your mother should make it known to one another what your love language is and communicate, in order to ensure that stuff doesn't go misunderstood.",1617459236
ISTJ,"I was diagnosed with autism but don‚Äôt have the behavioral problem, although one thing that happens with me is that I could be very open to people at first sight and then completely close off. With behavioral I mean the stereotypical autist. (Bunching head in walls, flapping etc.)

Most of all, it‚Äôs the memory and the can‚Äôt concentrate thing with me. 

For example, I come into the classroom and the first thing I notice is that there‚Äôs some stripe on the wall or someone writing down something, the teacher‚Äôs foot tapping on the ground and so on and on.

Now how do I prevent all this from happening, music. Music keeps all the unnecessary thoughts out of my head, it also helps me be more unaware of my surroundings and it keeps me focused on my studies. Sometimes I don‚Äôt need music because I can just daze off in my own world, I know I need to do this less.

I gather and write my dreams down, if I‚Äôm into drawing, I can create the exact picture that I saw in my head. Now I had done some research and found out that people daydream about 13 seconds, this was something extra... sorry. :-)

I could be socially exhausted and distance myself from people for more than three months, although I never used to be like that so I think that is because of the epidemic.",1617457760

ISTJ,"I think that it would help if you were direct. You being an infp, probably express affection through words and physical contact. I don't think you should change that for your mother's sake because she who has known you for your entire life should also come to terms with your differences. It'll work out in time, talk to her and communicate better, let her know what you want from her... Good day, hope this helps.",1617437694

ISTJ,"I can relate, entirely! I do not believe the 16p test is correct, so I would almost entirely ignore that. I would look at a few factors: 

1. How old are you?
2. Are you going through a big life change?
3. Do you hold any bias/are you answering 1000% honest to you and not to what is expected?

The first question is because the brain doesn‚Äôt fully develop until 26, so you could be at the awkward stage of not knowing you who are yet. 
The second is because if you are running on Si and you are facing a major change you can‚Äôt prepare for it may send you into overdrive and you could appear as a different type as a coping mechanism! (I‚Äôve done that twice in the last year. Never letting it happen again)
Thirdly I mean no offence by it, but I found that as a young female I answered a lot of the more feelings based questions the way I believed I was supposed to, not necessarily how I truly felt, that in a sense showed my traditionalist nature.

I personally wouldn‚Äôt worry about it too much. I‚Äôve been in your position and how I found my ‚Äòclick‚Äô was through coming to these Reddit pages and reading life experiences, reactions and interactions. It made me feel like I belonged.

ISTJ,"I mean logic over fiction, that's how I approached it when my kids were Younger",1617388931
ISTJ,"I had this same problem as a kid.  People coddled me and it continued into 7th grade even.  What got me out of the funk of having to sleep next to someone was when my grandpa, who is actually a complete dick, forced me to sleep alone in his supposedly haunted Victorian mansion bed and breakfast he owned in Indianapolis.

This was a huge deal because I had been watching paranormal shows and demon/ghost youtube videos, so old spooky stuff creeped me out.

The first night, I stayed up with the lights on and watched parks and rec the entire time.  The second night, I did the same but went to bed at 4 am from exhaustion.  Slowly but surely, I started going to bed at a normal time.

After two weeks, I didn't have to watch a comfort show anymore.  I was still somewhat afraid of ghosts, but I didn't care enough because if a demon was going to possess me, it would have already.

That's how my fears were cured.  I'm not an expert at all though, this is just an anecdote from an ISTJ teen.

As far as the Easter Bunny and Santa go, I figured they were fake when I was 7.  I pretended to make fun of my mom's Santa ritual, but when she stopped doing it when I turned 13, I strived for that routine and ritual, because it somehow made Christmas Eve special even though I didn't even believe in Santa.

Also a huge change in routine, like the ones that Covid started, could be the cause of stress.  I know that when I was younger, I hated changing routines.

This is completely anecdotal though.  Take all of my advice with a grain of salt.",1617381318

Any activities that you can do with her that involve logic and order could help (I'm speaking very loosely, don't know a whole lot about the functions - someone correct me here). Maybe something like baking or puzzles could be helpful - or any activity where you would work with her to figure something out.

And I wouldn't tell her about Santa or the Easter Bunny... I know that when I figured it out I felt so smart HAHAH

Then there is also a possibility that he is just not that much into dating, he likes doing stuff on his own and doesn't want to share as much time as you would wish for. Yeah he is reading that alpha stuff, but if he is anything like me, he does it because he is curious, this stuff is a bit mystery for him and interesting, not necessarily because he strives to be an alpha.

ISTJ,"My immediate reaction would be to be a bit freaked out. I'd get over that once I had some time to think though.

Most likely I'd use the same or close to the same format you used to express my reciprocal interest. If I wasn't interested, I would probably say nothing at all. In either case, I would be likely to be a little standoffish for a bit.

I don't think you'd get the response you really want with this method though. You throw out ""love"" and ""adoration"" into the ISTJ world and you're going to see that guy bolt. Start doing small things that gradually makes your target realize that he's interested. Even once you hit that milestone you might have to make the first real move. Start slow, be patient, get him used to the idea. It takes some time, but it's worth it. We're supposed to be very loyal creatures.",1617297878

I suggest you learn more about ISTJs. Go read the User Manual it'll help you a lot. The more you learn and understand his behavior the better you'll get at leaving a good impression.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

As u/Breadeater12 suggested, generally speaking you should send a message asking if it is okay for you to call. My friends know this by now so whenever we're texting each other and something comes up that they want to show me, they'll be like ""messenger call?"" or ""facetime?"" or ""discord?"" and only call once I've given explicit permission. 

Maybe if you're unable to see him in person and you're bold enough, you could even say something like ""Hey, I wanna see you. Can we call?"" Keep in mind that I don't know the exact relationship between you two or your ages so this might or might not be appropriate advice. Also, I don't know if you've expressed your interest in him *to* him, or if he's still in the dark and treating you as a friend/acquaintance. If you've already told him that you are interested in him then saying this might be okay (only if he didn't reject your advances), otherwise it might come off as a bit weird. I personally don't have any opinion on this but I think most people would like it if you expressed your interest in person so if you haven't already told him then this might not be the best thing to say.

Also, you mentioned that he's not responding to your messages. Then my question is, what kind of messages did you send? If you sent things like ""how are you?"" or ""yo what's up"" then it might not be the best idea to continue pestering him. I would recommend that you leave a message like ""hey, I wanna talk when you have time. Can you get back to me when you see this?"" and leave it at that. Give the dude some space and time to process it. Personally I really like texting and don't think it drains my social battery, so to speak, but I know not all introverts would agree with me.

I hope it works out for you :)",1617233095
ISTJ,"I can be assertive when I need to be (given that I had enough time to make preparations) and I can be outgoing sometimes (mostly when talking about my hobbies), so yea I think ""depends on the situation"" is definitely the answer for me",1617231959

ISTJ,"1- There isn't enough information to understand what's going on IMO  
2- The less you call the better he's an introvert after all, and he might be socially anxious.  
3- Don't call him during work hours. Big no no. Send him a message ""Hey, is it okay if I call you?"" or something. As silly as it sounds it's best to arrange a call.  
4- I'm not sure about the confrontation part and I hope others chime in on this, but it's best not to confront him about it. You might scare him off *especially* if you don't know each other that well.  
This applies to me and it might for him, I do not enjoy talking on the phone if it's not work related. I don't call my friends and talk about life or stuff. We meet instead.

Quality for me is usually defined by the time frame intend to use a product for. Of course, there could be many other factors to consider to ensure the product meet one's needs. A kitchen bench top appliance I use regularly and want it to last for at least a decade or more, happy to consider choices at higher price point. A garden tool I need for a one off job and couldn't borrow from people I know, will consider products at lower price point. If that tool lasts after that job, that's a plus.

As for gym equipment my bituminous plates are 7 years old and I don't think cast iron ones would give me less injuries to that point as I honestly registered zero. Also... There are literally free lunches where I live, so I don't know. I also can't relate to the rest, cause buying shoes specifically for running is beyond my imagination unless you mean overall sport shoes. Same with medical bills - I think dentist is the only medical help me and family get, I can't remember when I was visiting doctor, probably five years ago for mandatory vaccination.

ISTJ,"Most of what you listed has little to do with quality. I get the feel you care little about quality but want to feel like you do (?). 

There is no such things as free lunch. 

A good quality investment is about the long term, getting the more expensive shoes because they will last you a lifetime instead of getting the cheap ones, that break after one year. Getting the better gym equipment because it prevents injuries. Getting sturdy glass instead of plastic. 

I‚Äôm willing to pay more for quality if I know it will be cheaper in the long run. Buying good running shoes 120$ will be cheaper than buying bad ones 30$ that will ruin your feet and will cause medical bills (+ pain).",1617122312

I'm not alone doing that though.",1617121388
ISTJ,"Your second paragraph sums it up well. I'm not talking about overpriced things, but things that are expensive or even regular price AND technically worth the price (or at least they are clearly superior to cheaper ones). That's the corelation - quality requires money (mostly) and money requires quality work done (effort). Smart managing is obviously possible regardless if you are rich, middle class or poor, but the sole fact of working harder/longer to obtain something higher quality is what I was curious about. As for replacing - I love things easy to replace. It all comes down to low effort, safety and awareness nobody can force you to anything or hurt you cause you don't have much (valueable) to lose. Yes, relationships are truly complicated and risky, but I only covered the tangible part - assuming a person is alright she might be inclined towards materialistic good or be more oblivious to it. The latter is usually OK with low-ambition lifestyle. Thank you for your insight! I'm usually like most ISTJ, but I just really wish money matter as little as possible, so people cooperate better.",1617121081
ISTJ,"Your post title says ""quality"" but the content is all about saving money, or getting things for free. That's a weird correlation isn't?

If you are talking about saving money, yes we do (I hope the majority allows me to speak for them). We do it by not buying overpriced garbage, or garbage in general. That doesn't mean we'll buy a cheap 3$ shirt that will fade away after a couple of wash. Then what? Buy another 3$ shirt? Instead I'll spend 25$ on a brand I have used before and hopefully the quality of the fabric hasn't degraded which I can wear once every week for next 2 years. That is how we judge quality. You can replace that shirt &amp; amount with any physical purchasable item and it'll be same. Purchase once, use for years.

In relationship it works differently. We observe &amp; analyze for sometime. Only then we make our move. Friends, associates, someone we are attracted to, all are same in our books. We don't run after people to fill up our contact list.",1617120284

When younger I had none of that. It was pure black and white, you get the answer for what you asked.

ISTJ,"I think, mature (in terms of more experience dealing with people) ISTJs do sugarcoat also.

The reason is that when we are called, over and over, mean or insensitive, for being blunt, we tend to avoid doing it and leaving that only for extreme measures (e.g. someone is really annoyng you to say ""speak you mind and really tell me what you think"" ou someone we categorize as lacking character).

&amp;#x200B;

We kind of leave the bluntness for the ones really close, who we know that ""really knows us"" and won¬¥t mistake our words as ""mean"" or ""Insensitive""

But seriously. I think we(most of us) are just that blunt when super young (I know I was). 

When we hear continuously that bc of that we are ""mean"" or should ""tone it down"" we start feeling guilty and tend to ""give in"".

ISTJ,"

I've been in a relationship with an ESTP for almost seven years now. It has felt really effortless the whole way through. Because of our function stack we get along great. Se wants to give a good experience (it definitely knows how) and Si wants to have that experience but needs a little push out of its comfort zone. We help each other grow, he gets me out of my comfort zone -anything new is pretty much a no go for me, but he will convince me to try it with him and I have fun each and every time I try something new. I help him with his organization skills. The attraction is there from the start because we are opposites. I'm more of a grounded person and he likes to ""live on the wild side"". Since he has Fe as his third function and I don't, he can explain to me what's going on socially . Since I have Fi as my third function and he doesn't, I can explain to him what's going on internally with others if it's needed. 
This can also be a problem at times bc we're stepping on each other's blind spots, but hey nothing is perfect. I would say sometimes he likes to indulge in his Se and do activities that I either don't want to do at all or just not as much as him (smoking, drinking ). He will constantly ask me if I say no, forgetting that I don't need to do them  in order to have fun.  We don't like drama or games , and we can be honest/direct with one another. There's a mutual understanding and respect there.",1617080085

We just want people to be responsable and get things done when they say they will, delivering the agreed results.

We hate that bc in our point of view all humans should know what they are suposed to do and not be ""reminded"" by us.


However, if you are 100% she is an ISTJ, here is what you can do:

1. ""Prove"" that you are responsable ""quoting"" everytime you delivered things in the right due date/in a responsable way.

2. Show her that her micromaneging is affecting your good work bc you don't deserve the condescending treatment.

3. Show her that she is not being fair doing that bc she would not find it pleasant if someone did it to her.

""I want the better for the people and to change the world but if they don't accept ""my ideas of change/my help"" I will go on full dark/revenge mode.""

Warning: Long post.

I (INFP, 24F) met this ISTJ (25M) back in college (2015) when my then best friend and him were dating. They broke up 3 years later, and he reached out to me months after because no one ever seemed to check up on him and hear out his side of the story, which led to an emotional breakdown. I‚Äôve had a low maintenance friendship w him since then‚Äîcatching up a few times and updating each other on current relationships, etc.

Second half of 2020, we started vidcalling once a month while watching movies, talking til around 12-1am. And start of 2021, the monthly vidcalls became a weekly thing.

Recently, he biked to my place and again 2 days later (a city away) and even suggested visiting again the following week. It‚Äôs just surprising because he‚Äôs not one to just randomly visit people when he feels like it.. Esp not during a risky time like this.

We‚Äôve been talking daily &amp; he‚Äôd update me on his daily activities, send pics of where he‚Äôs going, what he‚Äôs currently eating/doing, which he never used to do..

Last week during a vidcall til 3am, he shared about his childhood and past relationships, etc., and I could tell he (too) felt overwhelmed by how much he‚Äôs shared and kept emphasizing how it‚Äôs his first time opening up all those personal stuff to someone.

We started listing down stuff to do after the pandemic (go to food parks, museums, plays, hiking) just the two of us, and idk, I can feel something between us but I can‚Äôt be sure.. Whenever we‚Äôd touch on the topic of romance (he asks a lot of ‚Äúwhat if this person confessed to you, etc etc), I‚Äôd panic and give him joking answers, then the topic would change ;(

I genuinely like him but neither of us seem bold enough to make a direct move.. It just got me thinking:

1.) How do relationships with ISTJs usually develop/become official? Do you guys usually confess first in a case like this?

2.) What can I say/ask to confirm if there‚Äôs something going on between us? Or like.. what‚Äôs an obvious hint I can give to show that I‚Äôm genuinely interested?

3.) How long do ISTJ‚Äôs usually pursue someone before deciding it‚Äôs not worth it?

4.) Is it normal to worry that he might just be talking to me because he‚Äôs bored/in need of company or because I‚Äôm the most available right now? Do you guys do that? Lol I know his type of girls (looks-wise) and I know I aint it üòÇ",1617423271
ISTJ,"I (Infp) just had a really honest conversation with my mother about our relationship, which we both agree has been a shallow one for many years. Lots of crying on my end. Not so much on hers, though I know she was hurting as well. I have a feeling she will probably cry some when she has some time to herself. 

We came to the conclusion that we both have vastly different love languages, interests, and world-views and that we've both hurt each other in various ways because of it. 

I felt neglected because I rarely heard words of affirmations from her, which is my love language. She felt misunderstood because the way she shows and honors love is through actions and not words. 

I admire the discussion and exchange of ideas in philosophy, literature and art. She admires the ability to run a functioning family and executing tasks efficiently and well. She has little interest in discussing feminism in Thomas Hardy books, and I am incredibly inefficient and clumsy when it comes to managing her affairs or mine. 

She said something to me today that really stuck with me. (For context, I had just crocheted a small doll inspired by the Among Us game that was really popular last year.)

She said something along the lines of, ""I think I understand where our differences lie in just how we appreciate this doll you crocheted. 

For you, you appreciate the doll because of its connection to the game that you created it for. It represents a character in the game. When you look at it, you are not looking at the doll itself but rather a symbol for a game you really love. 

For me, when I look at this doll, I notice how neat your stitches look. How structured the doll is, not overstuffed and not under-stuffed, so that it stands up straight but is still very soft. I notice the details you put into the doll to make it look the way it does, and I appreciate your doll for your craftsmanship. 

You could've crocheted a teddy bear, a flower, or a scarf. WHAT you crochet doesn't matter to ME. Your craftsmanship does. But WHAT you crochet matters to YOU. It has to mean something to you. The craftsmanship comes second. At the end of the day we both appreciate this doll, but for different reasons.""  

In my opinion, I think she pretty much summed up the INFP/ISTJ relationship with that analogy. We both know that we love each other, but the way we go about showing it and experiencing it, feels like its been constant missed high fives. 

Can you guys offer me some of your perspectives? Have you ever had a deep relationship with an INFP? What made that relationship successful? What makes a relationship fulfilling to you?

These are traits I want to have but I contradict many of them. I am very outwardly emotional, idealistic, imaginative, makes silly mistakes sometimes, and sensitive. I am passionate and I wear my heart on my sleeve. A lot of ISTJs are hardcore introverts; I am more ambiverted. I am very outgoing but I can be solitary for hours. I think I am either ENFP or ENFJ. I am not INFJ because I have fairly decent Te. I may be an enneagram 1.

ISTJ,"So I (21f, esxp) like an 20m istj, and we're kinda in the same friend circle, and we've been hanging out a bit more lately, and we sit beside each other in some classes.

He has a speech he has to present tomorrow, and on Saturday I had asked him how it was going. He said he was making progress but that he just needed to do some run throughs, so I offered to be an audience for him and that I'd love to hear it! But.... he saw the message and then never replied back, I told one of my guy friends about it a couple hours after, and he had said he saw my crush doing laps off the sports field, and he could just be freaking out because he's never had a girl like him/show interest. 

It's been a day and he still hasn't said anything and I haven't ran into him. Sometimes he won't reply back if there doesn't need to be a reply, or if he saw it too late that it's not relevant anymore, which makes sense. Which is what happened a couple days ago, but when we were walking back from class I asked how he was doing and he started talking about his speech and stuff, then he asked about me. Something I noticed that was different is that he seemed eager to talk to me, and whenever the conversation seemed like it should end he just looked at me to keep it going, and we chatted for a bit before I went back to room. 

I'm just worried I scared him off, I was just trying to be helpful by offering to listen to his speech, and now I'm worried he's not going to even want to be my friend anymore... 

I always feel like I have to initiate things with him, even though he seems interested and we vibe really well together. I just feel like if he did like me then he would at least try a bit at least.

What should I do? How should I act him if I want something to happen between us? I havent liked a guy this much since I was in high school, and it's stressing me out. 

I'm worried about class tomorrow, because I dont want it to be awkward, I feel like if he sees me I'm just gonna want to run and hide. I wanted to tell him good luck for his speech tomorrow morning and that I hope he does well, just so he knows I care, but I'd probably just creep him out even more...",1615780487

ISTJ,"Hey ISTJ's,

INFP here. I'm coming to your subreddit to ask like many other people here about an ISTJ male I'm interested in. Our relationship has been quite turbulent and is definitely not usual lol

We met through an online game and because we're from different european countries our relationship has just been online. We flirted a lot from the beginning, got into sexting pretty fast as well mostly because we're probably both bored during the pandemic and yeah we were just having fun. It's been a few months now and lately i feel like we've become a lot closer, sharing more personal things and building an emotional relationship next to the sexual one.

Yesterday he got a little drunk while we were playing which resulted in him being way more affectionate than usual towards me. And after we had ended the call and i was about to go to bed he texted me that he doesn't want me to leave him and then (&amp; this is the reason why I'm making this post) he texted me ""i love you"" in german which is my native language (he can speak some german and usually says random stuff to me in german to probably be funny idk xD)

I'm not sure how to take this now and how to handle this. Was he just joking around in a flirtatious way like with the other things he said and like he usually does? I mean he was drunk. So i didn't wanted to take it literally and didn't react directly to it, but he even wrote it twice before i finally went to sleep....
Today i chatted with him again like usually and we didn't talk about it again, I'm too afraid to ask about it tbh. This is my first relationship actually and i really don't know what to do now...

I'm not sure if this is even related to him being an ISTJ lol but i read that ISTJ's usually don't say stuff like ""i love you"" so lightly especially because i feel like our relationship isn't that deep yet, so maybe he really was just joking? 

Thank you for reading ig :)",1615747697

ISTJ,"I have been struggling with deciding on my type for quite a while now. I resonate more with the description of the INTJs behavior, but I am not so sure about whether I actually use Ni or Si (perhaps because of its role as a subconscious though-process). It is also quite difficult for me to relate to the behavior of an arbitrary ISTJ. What I am completely sure of however is the fact that my usage of Te is very pronounced, but I am also **profoundly** introverted. ESTJ is therefore not a feasible option.

Some insight from other ISTJs and INTJs would be highly appreciated.

ISTJ,"





I used a socionics test and got SLI and showed i had high Si, which means ISTJ and i also felt that i could somewhat relate to that type. But the issue is i am not organized nor am i traditional rather idealistic, i don‚Äôt remember just everything, every date, i infact can be forgetful. I do remember some situations, and can get reminded about it in my brain(Its what i tend to). And secondly, i have hell lot of unfinished task, i do am bothered by it, but i don‚Äôt do it cause‚Äô i am lazy and a procrastinator. I could also relate to INTP and INFP, mostly INTP. But the tests said i had high si followed by Fi and Ti, and then Te and lastly and at very least it was Ne. 
I don‚Äôt what the hell i am. People are saying it‚Äôs just stereotypes about ISTJ that they are traditional and Dutiful, but they can be lazy and also procrastinate. 
 
When i speak with someone, i do listen to them carefully but sometimes i get lost in my brain thinking about some other topic or situation(if the conversation gets boring). I tend to think about some situations which had happened in the past, yes i do, but i also try to think about what i should say when something similar occurs in the future. And i am awkward. And i don‚Äôt really take insults personally, i believe if someone is rude with me for no reason, it‚Äôs a problem with them not me. That‚Äôs all. 

And on Enneagram i relate mostly to 9, 4, 6, and 5.

Ive been trying to figure out my partners mum's type for ages now :) I was watching a YouTube video when I thought she maybe ISTP? I've made some notes of things I've noticed and observed. I'm INFP and partner is ESFP

I thought she was ESTJ or ESFJ for ages but it doesn't quite fit for her. I had thought ISTP so had posted over there but their thoughts were she's possibly ISTJ? So here I am haha :)



-not sure if extrovert or introvert, can seem both
-is blunt, seems loud sometimes but not at other times, no tact
-likes plans , is obsessed with what time things are,hates their plans being disrupted
- seems productive and organised but also messy at other times. Ocd
-seems unemotional but then has emotional outbursts
-seems bossy and controlling, likes to be in control of external environment
-talks more about what people are doing, like a big house someone has, but seems day dreamy other times (ni ?-)
- not very conversational, more a get to the point type, doesn't like small talk or long conversations
- duty seems important seems to like to help people but seems scattered and likes to have plans then changes them. I say duty, but what I think I mean is, she will choose a time for something, then procrastinate for hours then turn up hours later :/
-seems very unsettling at times. Needs lots of attention, always has to be about them. But then seems very private also. Often goes off for alone time.
- seems emotional underneath, is very much about family but keeps everyone else at arms length even family sometimes
-will come up with ideas, like how to move furniture around and what it will look like and could do this and do that
-doesn't seem that logical, it seems that way at first but not really
-argumentative/ stubborn
- seems to get bored and likes to stir up trouble and unsettle people
-doesn't seem to like small talk and is hard to get to know or connect with or get close to
-isn't very good with compliments, taking or giving and seems uncomfortable, same with gifts. If you give them a gift or card, they don't acknowledge or say thanks.  If you give a compliment or ask about them, they seem to respond better via text or messenger rather than face to face
-they are doers
-communication seems short and sharp
-sometimes seems their way or no way but not sure if this is a stress response
-zones in and out of conversations
-seems oblivious to how she comes across and how others perceive her and doesn't care at all
- when she needs you she needs you, then when she doesn't, she just doesn't and will shut you out and seems very private 
-is unaware of other people's emotions 
-things have to be their way all the time
-when complaining it's often about how something or other doesn't work, but she's so stuck in present moment and gets very frustrated at whatever the thing is that's not working
-is quite precise with things, like cooking. 
- very emotionally reactive all the time - this is the one that has me the most stuck with her, are ISTP even emotionally reactive? She becomes like panicky and scattered.

Also,   Any hints on enneagram would be great too :)

ISTJ,"Hi! I am (so it seems and so he and the test analysed me) an enfj (and estp) girl. He is an istj who says about himself he is ""learning feelings"" in the moment. (He is very into these personality kind of stuff) 

The thing is, he is really amazing and I liked him from the first talk, but the problem is that he is more traditional when it comes to texting: so just texting mostly for making plans. He isn't even saying ""hi"" before he askes, he just straight forward texts me if I wanna do this and that, and if I answer yes, he doesn't even reply okay. I am trying to be less on my phone so I try to tell myself it is good that he is like that, but it kind of stresses me to have only this little contact and always have to either wait for him to text eventually or text him myself, which makes me feel like I am bothering him though. 

We have only met up 3 times so far and he never had a girlfriend or any experiences with girls, I have quite some experience with guys. 

I am just unsure how much I should try to conform to his personality, in this case for example trying to get used to it and accept it, because I know it's not wrong what he does, just different, or if I should talk to him and take my feelings more seriously and demand more contact in form of calls or texts for it to have a future. 

What are your opinions on that? 

Tdlr: unsure how much I can demand from a person, or if I should just work on myself, in this case, demanding more contact from him or working on myself for being fine with only a few messages a week.

ISTJ,"Hello, everyone I recently have been studying about sensory processing sensitivity (SPS) which is an attribute of highly sensitive persons (HSPs). I am curious to see if certain MBTI types are more likely to be HSPs than others, so I am going to post a poll in each subreddit about this. **You can find out if you are an HSP by taking the following test:** [**Are You Highly Sensitive? ‚Äì The Highly Sensitive Person (hsperson.com)**](https://hsperson.com/test/highly-sensitive-test/)**. A score higher than 14 on this test indicates that you might have SPS (you are an HSP).** If you do not like the binary nature of this test you can take the version used by researchers here: [Microsoft Word - HSPSCALE\_2007\_research.doc (hsperson.com)](http://hsperson.com/pdf/HSPSCALE_2007_research.pdf). A score of 105 or higher on this version indicates that you likely are an HSP (I calculated this cutoff by using the cutoff for the shorter version which is 15/27 possible points and assuming that the same percentage of points on the longer test indicates that you are an HSP). **If you are willing please take the test to see if you are an HSP and then fill out the poll below. Thank you.**

I am also going to post some research articles here for those of you who would like to learn more about HSPs and the research behind it (I am quoting from another post that I made about this):

""Hello everybody, I have recently been looking at various studies regarding HPSs. To be honest when I first heard about HSPs I thought that the idea was either a false pop psychology idea, or autism spectrum disorder or anxiety disguised under a fancy name. However, after reading the studies I will list below I am now convinced that sensory processing sensitivity (SPS) is real and that being an HSP is a unique, valid concept. I believe these studies are useful to get an in-depth understanding of what it truly means to be an HSP and they can also be useful to show that the idea of HSPs is valid. Here are the studies:

[The functional highly sensitive brain: a review of the brain circuits underlying sensory processing sensitivity and seemingly related disorders (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5832686/) (Discusses fMRI studies of SPS in comparison to autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, and post-traumatic stress disorder.

[The highly sensitive brain: an fMRI study of sensory processing sensitivity and response to others' emotions - PubMed (nih.gov)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25161824/) (Provides evidence that higher HSP scores are correlated with ‚Äústronger activation of brain regions involved in awareness, empathy, and self-other processing‚Äù)

[The trait of sensory processing sensitivity and neural responses to changes in visual scenes (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3023077/) (‚ÄúSPS was associated with significantly greater activation in brain areas involved in high-order visual processing (i.e. right claustrum, left occipitotemporal, bilateral temporal and medial and posterior parietal regions) as well as in the right cerebellum, when detecting minor (*vs* major) changes in stimuli.‚Äù)

[Sensory Processing Sensitivity Predicts Individual Differences in Resting-State Functional Connectivity Associated with Depth of Processing - PubMed (nih.gov)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33561863/) (‚ÄúThe present study showed that SPS is associated with \[resting-state\] brain connectivity implicated in attentional control, consolidation of memory, physiological homeostasis, and deliberative cognition. These results support theories proposing ""depth of processing"" as a central feature of SPS and highlight the neural processes underlying this cardinal feature of the trait.‚Äù)

[Higher sensory processing sensitivity, introversion and ectomorphism: New biomarkers for human creativity in developing rural areas (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3409988/) (Discusses various aspects of SPS such as its involvement in creativity and also its presence in animals)

[Temperament trait of sensory processing sensitivity moderates cultural differences in neural response (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2894664/) (‚ÄúHere, 10 European-Americans and 10 East Asians underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing simple visuospatial tasks emphasizing judgments that were either context independent (typically easier for Americans) or context dependent (typically easier for Asians). As reported elsewhere, each group exhibited greater activation for the culturally non-preferred task in frontal and parietal regions associated with greater effort in attention and working memory. However, further analyses, reported here for the first time, provided preliminary support for moderation by SPS. Consistent with the careful-processing theory, high-SPS individuals showed little cultural difference; low-SPS, strong culture differences.‚Äù)

Two hundred and one college students completed the highly sensitive person scale, as well as measures of anxiety, depression, alexithymia, and autism symptoms. EOE and LST were related to autism symptoms, alexithymia, anxiety, and depression. AES was related to attention to details (a symptom of autism) and anxiety but not to depression. It was also negatively related to externally-oriented thinking (a symptom of alexithymia). Results indicate that AES is conceptually distinct from LST and EOE. Furthermore, EOE interacted with difficulty identifying feelings in predicting anxiety, indicating that being both easily excited by stimuli and unable to identify one‚Äôs feelings is particularly anxiety provoking.‚Äù)

The HSPS scale was found to be reliable in this study and ‚ÄúFactor analysis revealed a novel five-factor solution (Negative Affect, Neural Sensitivity, Propensity to Overwhelm, Careful Processing and Aesthetic Sensitivity). As per previous reports, latent class analysis suggested a three class solution.‚Äù The study also discusses some weaknesses of the HSPS scale that could be improved such as the lack of reverse-coding in the assessment to address agreeability bias (i.e. reversing statements to make them negative). For example, I avoid violent movies could be easily reverse coded by switching the wording to I enjoy violent movies, but the original scale does not do this for any of the questions.)

ISTJ,"Hi I've tried doing research on my own and still can't tell which type I am so I'm hoping someone on here can give me some help. (Sorry in advance for the long read). I always thought I was ESTJ because especially when I was younger I was more socially extroverted. Now that I'm older and I know a lot more about mbti and cognitive functions I realized that social extroversion does not dictate type. I relate a lot to both ISTJ and ESTJ characters, memes etc. I have taken several cognitive function tests and the results just confused me further. Every time I get very high Te and Si (within a point or two of each other) and then lower down Fi and Ne usually also very close with slightly higher Fe on a few of the tests. Since my lower two functions are obviously less clear and not as developed I find it difficult to tell whether my Fi or Ne is actually more used. A brief description: I was very very outgoing as a child but have become much more withdrawn as I've gotten older and often just want to be left alone but I am fine with being constantly around 1 or 2 people close to me (I am very very chatty around friends and coworkers though). I have been in management positions at work and really enjoyed being promoted mostly because I liked that I was trusted enough to receive the position and did everything I could to be a kind, fair mentor to my subordinates. I am also fine with not being in change as long as the people above me are doing their job well or I feel the need to step up and do things correctly. I would not consider myself particularly creative but I do have a very random, goofy sense of humor (Ne maybe?) and have no issue revamping things at work if they are not working well or don't make sense but otherwise would not typically incite any kind of change. I was involved in a situation with a coworker where she was a good person and my friend but always was breaking rules and getting in trouble on the job but because of this a lot of people essentially started bullying her and I didn't like that because it was uncalled for and mean so I ended up getting some flack from coworkers for defending her and told my boss ""I'm sorry I don't care if everyone hates me but I'm not going to bully someone unnecessarily just because everyone else is"" (Fi?). I am typically very blunt and insensitive but I only stick my nose in or get controlling with people very close to me otherwise I don't really care what people are doing with their lives. It is important to me to be liked and I would love to be part of a respected organization on a team but not at the expense of compromising who I am or what is important to me. I guess I just struggle to recognize what Ne looks like for ESTJs and ISTJs to see when I'm using it. Also obviously both types us Fi but I can't tell if I'm using it the way an ESTJ would or an ISTJ would and how to tell the difference. Enneagram is 1w2 163 for sure if that helps. Any insight would be very appreciated! Thank you!",1615245239

ISTJ," Hello everyone, I was recently wondering if there are any sort of correlations between MBTI type and political leanings, so I decided to post a poll in each MBTI type subreddit to assess this. I am aware that Reddit is not representative of the general population, so these results will not give an absolute indication as to where each MBTI type falls on the political spectrum on average, but I still think these polls could be useful to form relative comparisons (i.e. are INTJ Reddit users more liberal than ISTJ Reddit users, etc.). Please answer the poll and respond with any thoughts you have below. Thank you.

Also, I just saw that there was a recent post about politics in the ISTJ subreddit, but I'm still going to post this anyways so that I can have a post with the same format in the ISTJ subreddit to compare to my posts in the other types' subreddits.

ISTJ,"Hi again. It's me, the 22 years old ISTJ female who posted few days ago about getting stuck in a kind of depression/isolation situation after two similar toxic relationships.

I'm feeling better now. It's been a month since I started getting in this situation. It started with me losing faith in relationships and friendships which led to me getting as far as possible from everyone except my family so I can protect myself from repeating the same mistakes again.

I never felt lonely in my 22 years of living cuz I'm very comfortable with my own company that I don't feel like I need anyone else - but the past few weeks, I started feeling lonely and being alone with myself felt like being trapped in a cold and dark place, and yet I hated the idea of talking to anyone and stepping out of this dark yet safe place to the unknown.

I believe I experienced a kind of depression wave, cuz I never felt that miserable before and it was so bad and heavy to the point I started to question my mental health. It felt like I was being sucked by a huge black hole with no chance to escape.

I felt extremely empty almost all day and I sometimes hated getting out of my room to even interact with my family. It was so unfamiliar and unexpected to be in that situation especially for someone who is so self-sufficient, logical and mentally strong like me.

For the first time in my life I felt like I needed help - I needed anyone to help me, yet I hated showing any living soul that fragile part of me so I decided to keep it in and deal with it alone like I always do, despite feeling so hopeless and miserable.

After weeks being in that situation, I'm starting to feel better. I'm going back to my usual self - my own company is back to be comfortable. I'm not feeling miserable and empty. I'm not getting unnecessarily emotional. I'm not feeling like being trapped in the dark. I'm not feeling lonely. I'm fine.

Although my faith in people and relationships is still lost. I'm still isolating myself as a way of protection. I can't bring myself to talk to others. I have no desire to make any new relationships or friendships - but at least I'm mentally better. Although I'm alone but I'm comfortable.

I don't know how long it's going to take till I can make new relationships, but I'm not gonna rush it and I sure am not gonna let my emotions decide ever again.

Thank you for reading my posts and thanks for all the people who tried to help on my previous post.",1614382137

ISTJ,"Hi. I'm an ISTJ, F, 22 years old and a college student.

I'm a very self-sufficient person since my childhood, and my relationships are very few. I actually have had only two close relationships in my 22 years of living and unfortunately they were both toxic and pretty similar, it was like a history repeating itself. 

I ended my second relationship a month ago and I finally broke free from its toxicity - I'm a type of person who moves on quickly and just doesn't look back and I did move on quickly this time too - after my first relationship, I took two years of pure isolation and I just was comfortable being totally alone without any relationships or even friends (I don't actually have friends cuz it's uncomfortable and I'm always all by myself cuz I like spending time with myself).

After my recent break up, I expected myself to have difficulties with making any new relationships since it's something I've experienced before, but this time, it's just different.

It's been really heavy on me. I did move on but I feel stupid for repeating the same mistakes especially that I'm a smart and cautious person. I lost faith in relationships and friendships. I've become more isolated and more introvert in an unhealthy way. I feel empty almost all day.

It's like I'm in a prison that I made myself to protect myself, but it's so dark and lonely inside it, and I know it's unsafe and uncomfortable outside it too.

I have no friends and it's my own choice. I'm a type of person that keeps everything to themselves, so no one knows what I went/ I'm going through. I have no desire to meet new people. I have no desire to talk to anyone. I have no desire to do anything.

Yet.. I feel like I need someone to help me, which is my first time in my entire life to feel like I need someone else other than myself.

I'm always comfortable with my own company, but nowadays, although I'm all alone, but still, it's really heavy to be by myself, and yet, I don't wanna be with anyone else.

I'm sorry if it sounds complicated or like it doesn't make sense. I'm not good at expressing myself and it's rare for me to talk about myself.",1614184494

Even though I have been going to the gym for 2 years and have a toned body, I don't feel confident or at the very least, look a girl in the eye. Even though I do my work consistently, I have 117th Rank in a class of 130, where the rest of my batch smoke weed, study the day before and still manage to get 4.0 GPA. In my class, Almost nobody does readings and do homework other than me, Still they manage to score higher than me. I'm the one that works the most in a group assignment, Sometimes even carrying the whole group singlehandedly in return for a 'Thank You'. Hell, I'm the one that's teaching them the concepts just the day before the exam. My social life is nonexistent. I have started losing confidence in everything that I do and have started smoking cigarettes today at the time of writing this, something I'm not proud of. 

I don't get it. I always thought sticking true to your work and following rules brings order and peace to life. This schedule of mine has been hard kept, And I'm devastated that I'm not being the successful person I'm aspiring to be through this.

ISTJ,"Sorry for the long post in advance, but I‚Äôm looking for some advice from some ISTJs. I am a INFJ (F) and have had a crush on my friend ISTJ (M) for a while now. Our friendship has been complicated to say the least, but somehow we always make it through. 

The complications started basically when mutual friends told me things that he has apparently said about me, a couple years ago now. Until then I was kind of trying to feel out the situation myself. Basically I was told that he said he would like me but given our cultural differences it wouldn‚Äôt work out bc at family events I wouldn‚Äôt fit in basically. I messaged him first all the time so I must like him, and  that there were apparently other girls (a list) he was interested in. After hearing about said list, I was pretty hurt and cut off my ISTJ friend. It seemed odd to me that he was so open with our mutual friends, given we were all newish friends and he is a very reserved person but I didn‚Äôt really have much else to go off of. He would flirt here and there, but I just wrote him off as a player 

After I cut him off, he started asking the mutual friends and my best friend why I was ignoring him bc being the INFJ that I am, I can be quite cold when I‚Äôm hurt. He tried to message me and ask what was wrong, and talk in person but I was advised to just cut off him, so I left him on read üôÉ given we had classes together, it was inevitable that I would see him and eventually we started talking again. He asked what happened but I felt that I couldn‚Äôt ‚Äúsnake out‚Äù our mutual friends so I didn‚Äôt say much other than I heard some things. He then told me I should judge things based on how he acts towards me, and not the things I hear 

It‚Äôs been a long while since then. Lots of flirting has happened. He would playfully touch me, always sit next me, say some smooth things and even asked to hold my hand, but I couldn‚Äôt seem to get what I heard out of my mind and let that get in the way, which I now regret. A few times over text we decided we needed to ‚Äútalk about things‚Äù but each time I waited for him to bring it up in person which didn‚Äôt happen. Now given Covid, and the fact the in person classes didn‚Äôt happen, I haven‚Äôt seen him for a while either for me to judge the situation in person. He‚Äôs done school now, but he sometimes used to say things to suggest he wanted to meet up or hangout but then wouldn‚Äôt follow up with a text to confirm or make solid plans. If I initiate plans, he will agree and says he‚Äôs down, but again no follow up. Seems weird given we are technically friends. 

As for messaging and communication, I really enjoy talking to him and our convos are great imo. It seems like the cultural thing isn‚Äôt as much of an issue anymore, as he knows I‚Äôm quite knowledgeable about his and he asks questions about mine. He is usually the one to initiate convos and they extend continuously over days, but then sometimes he just goes an entire day and replies to me once. It makes me feel like he is ignoring me or doesn‚Äôt want to talk to me. In one of those phases rn after a really long time so I‚Äôm pretty thrown off. 

Basically the advice I‚Äôm searching for is, I‚Äôm not really sure what to do. I really do like him but I‚Äôm not sure if he likes me back. I was pretty certain at one point he did, but I was waiting for him to outright say it and kinda let what I heard get in the way. Some people would say I shut him down, but that wasn‚Äôt my intention at all! Now it‚Äôs been a while and idk how he feels about me at all 

Tldr: have a crush on my istj friend, who seemed to like me back but given my feelings I wanted to be a hundred percent sure. Things got complicated and we don‚Äôt see each other much. We text and stuff but sometimes he just disappears, and doesn‚Äôt make plans to hang out. I‚Äôm not sure where we stand now and is it possible he just gave up or lost feelings?",1614020966

ISTJ,"Hey ISTJ‚Äôs! 

I have this huge crush on my guy friend who‚Äôs an ISTJ male (I‚Äôm an ISFJ female). I do have a gut feeling and I guess some evidence that he does like me, but I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm just thinking that he likes me when he really doesn‚Äôt. I guess I need some reassurance that he likes me.

So we‚Äôve always been somewhat friends since around November 2019, but this year we‚Äôve became much closer. I‚Äôm not sure if he‚Äôs just overly friendly, or if he really likes me more than a friend. 

Somethings I‚Äôve noticed this year is that around other people, he‚Äôs very serious, doesn‚Äôt smile that often (has an RBF I would say), has a monotone voice, and somewhat quiet. 

However, when we hanged out last week, he seemed very smiley, he always laughed at what I said, he playfully touched me, his voice got softer, and at the end when I had to leave, he said, ‚Äúohh that felt really short. Time felt so fast, and not gonna lie I had a lot of fun with you today.‚Äù He even offered to teach me how to play the piano, and touched my hand a lot. We also sat really close to each other with our legs touching each other, and I also noticed him looking at me up and down while I was standing up for a second and searching something up on my phone. 

Another thing is that it seems like he cares about me maybe? I told him I was working on this thing, so I told him I had to sleep really late due to this. He offered to help me and he slept past 12am, even though he goes to sleep earlier than that (around 10pm). I asked him, ‚Äúwait don‚Äôt you have to go to sleep now? It‚Äôs getting pretty late and you really don‚Äôt have to help me.‚Äù He told me, ‚Äúoh I‚Äôm doing this because you help me a lot and I really don‚Äôt want you to stress out and all, so I want to help you regardless of how long this is gonna take.‚Äù 

Something we‚Äôve also been doing is trading books with each other and making each other these homemade cards with a message at the back. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs been pretty fun doing these with him, and it makes me appreciate him a lot more. 

When we do text each other, I would say I initiate most of the conversation though. He does initiate the conversation sometimes, but I feel like I initiate it way more. I guess he does keep the conversation going with questions like, ‚Äúhow was your day?‚Äù or ‚Äúheyy how was the quiz?‚Äù Sometimes he talks about something that‚Äôs been bugging him that day. We‚Äôve also shared facts about ourselves and things we‚Äôre similar in just for fun. We even made a list together of things we‚Äôre similar in, as well as asking each other questions like ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs your favourite ice cream?‚Äù 

I‚Äôd say the conversations would last for 1-2 hours. He also sends me a lot of memes, jokes around with me, he‚Äôs very sarcastic, and teases me. When I first messaged him (when he didn‚Äôt like me as much I would say), he didn‚Äôt use that much emojis. Now that we‚Äôre way closer this year, he uses more emojis than he usually would. 

Anyway, what do you ISTJ guys think? Do you think he likes me? Or could he just be overly really nice because I‚Äôm overly really nice to him?",1613871872

ISTJ,"My 11 year old is an ISTJ. I divorced his father and his father badmouthed me and played victim so my ISTJ and one of my other children ended up refusing to see or talk to me. We were all fine and healing and adjusting until about 4 months into the divorce, now it‚Äôs been 6 months since my ISTJ child has talked to me. 

My oldest has come back around, but my ISTJ 11yo still refuses and he has marked disdain for me. I‚Äôm trying not to take it personally as I know his personality is very logical and structured. The divorce upset this structure and on top of that, he was led to believe that I‚Äôm the terrible at-fault parent and their father is a saint. 

The marriage included an incredible depth of emotional, physical, sexual, etc. abuse, and I feel proud to have worked up the courage to leave. But I have never and will never share these details with the children. So they only have one side. And I‚Äôm painted as the villain. I‚Äôm not sure why, but I accepted this perhaps because I feel like truth prevails with time. 

But in the process I have lost a child who was once my little side kick. His wit and humor and introversion meshed with mine. We were very close before this. Now he calls me Sauron and makes fun of my other kids for continuing to see me. The hate, whether a surface emotion of pain or not (I can‚Äôt tell), is intense. 

Any advice on what I should do? I want to respect his space and his opinions, even if they‚Äôre harshly drawn opinions of me, but at the same time ... losing a kid is traumatizing. Is there any way of regaining a relationship with him again?",1613453732

ISTJ,"I first posted this in r/askguys, but since I'm 90% sure the guy is an ISTJ (I'm ISFJ), I wanted to get ya'll's expert opinions as well. Tl;dr at the bottom

I have a guy friend (ISTJ) that I talk to pretty often. I've known him since the beginning of last fall. He asked me to hang out once before winter break, which really freaked me out because I thought it meant he liked me, but it's been a few months since we hung out (just social distancing at our school library and talking) and he hasn't made any kind of move, even though we started texting a lot over the break.

Whenever we texted, I was kind of stressed and was hesitant to give him anything he could interpret as a green light. But after a few conversations, I started to realize we had a lot in common and enjoyed talking to him more and more. He never said anything that actually indicated romantic interest, so I eventually became comfortable talking to him as a friend. I made sure to sprinkle my messages with lots of ""dudes"" and ""bros"" and generally refer to our friendship as something I was really grateful for as such if it came up. Admittedly, I was hoping I would develop feelings at first, because he's a really nice guy. I even thought I liked him for maybe a week or two, and I might have potentially sent him slightly more warm and more frequent messages at that time, although nothing that could be pointed to as concrete evidence of a crush. But once I started seeing him in-person again after winter break, I realized I still had zero physical attraction for this guy, and I just didn't see us being compatible at all. So the little baby crush I had has died, and I just think of him as a pretty good friend. That's where I'm at.

However, I still think he may like me. We were chatting today about being single on Valentine's Day (a convo initiated by him), and he told me that he was just telling someone else that among lots of practical things, like being in school, not having a car, etc., one of the reasons he doesn't have a girlfriend is that he's just too shy to talk about deeper feelings. He also relayed to me another part of this convo he had where they asked him why he didn't have a girlfriend and he said he didn't want to try anything now because this and that reason, mainly Covid and school stuff, might make the relationship feel rushed or strained. Nothing direct, but a lot of stuff that smelled a LOT like he could be testing the waters, seeing what my own thoughts were on these complications. I tried to keep my answers general, like ""yeah I can see how that would be hard, but everyone's different, to each their own ya know, so idk."" Thinking back on it, I'm not sure that was the best response. I also made sure to say something about how I'm currently the happiest I've ever been about being single, as well as ended the convo with ""happy Palentine's Day,"" as a spinoff of Galentine's day, which hopefully gave a pretty clear message.

And besides this instance, since he got back in town for school, and we're both attending meetings of the organization we both belong to, he's been individually texting me things after events, saying ""Great hanging out with you today!"" and similar stuff. At on event, he offered to pay for my food when the group was getting dinner because we were both going to have to pay the guy who got it anyway. I am ashamed to admit that I accepted because I am a college student and can't physically say no to free food. And I'm 80% sure I see him glancing at me out of the corner of my eye fairly often when we're in the same vicinity. It's a lot of little stuff like that keeps adding up and making me sweat a little. But an ISTJ and an ISFJ are not the same creature, plus I haven't really known any guys quite like him before, so I don't know if I'm just best judge of his motives.

Does this sound like crushing behavior for you guys, especially if it seems to be stuff he only does to me, or am I overthinking him just being a good friend? He has talked about really wanted to be able to make good, lasting friendships while at college (we're freshmen), so I do NOT want to shoot down a friendship that's just that.

BUT I also really don't want to lead him on if he thinks there's potential for more than friendship in our relationship. It's becoming increasingly apparent that I'm not going to want anything more with him any time soon; he's a great friend, but just not my type romantically at all. He's a good guy, and he doesn't deserve to be hurt. We're currently texting at least once, max three times a week--at least once because I at one point offered to be his mutual accountability buddy for forming a certain good habit we were talking about. I regret that a lot because now I'm not sure how to let the relationship just peter out slowly if necessary. But that's my question: Is it necessary? If there's a chance I'm seeing the signs correctly, should I be up front and ask him, should I minimize contact, or should I just proceed as usual until he actually says he's interested or asks me to hang out one-on-one again? How would you guys hope to be treated in this situation? Any guys who come across this, not just ISTJs, but I'm also wondering if ISTJs care more about a clean ""break."" Would you be ok with the awkwardness if I asked, but you really did just want to be friends and I misinterpreted your behavior?

tl;dr I've been friendly with this ISTJ guy, and I'm not sure if he likes me, but it increasingly seems like he's testing the waters for something more, and since I don't like him like that, I don't want to lead him on. Should I ask him upfront, just talk to him one-on-one less, or leave things as they are until he actually says something?

Thanks guys!",1613371138
ISTJ,"Since Covid-19, my best friend‚Äôs mental health has taken a toll. He‚Äôs not taking any progress in his life at all, esp with the travel restriction. He‚Äôs 26, good looking, grounded, incredible loyal, a hard ass with strict rules in his life and is financially stable. He has high standards that make finding a perfect mate already hard enough in his country. He has been using dating apps for a few year and even with a premium subscription, he still can‚Äôt find a girlfriend. He‚Äôs very determined to find the love of his life, no matter what it takes.

I have been telling him to develop a hobby since he‚Äôs plain boring as hell and he‚Äôs working on it. 

I also told him to focus on himself and love will come alongside but well as an ISTJ, he got the other aspects in his life controlled. 

As an INTJ myself, I hate the modern dating scheme and patrolling myself through the meat market. But it‚Äôs something introverted people have to go through in order to find more people to mate.

ISTJ,"After an incredible 7-week monogamous relationship, beautiful widowed ISTJ female paused a relationship with me as she was spread thin with multiple events occurring in her life. They were: 1) 4 children to care for (22M, 20M, 18M, 14F), 2) quickly reacting to a perfect opportunity to purchase a home, 3) selling current home (#2 &amp; #3 both accomplished with 2 weeks!), 3) starting in a new territory at work, 4) selling different products in new territory and 5) packing up current home. She cut off her relationship with me as she could not devote proper time to us. It has been 6 weeks since I saw her and her house closings are still 2 months away. Also, she caught covid during our time apart. I have only texted her once during this time to honor her need to get things in her life in order. We mutually decided to take a ""time out"" and she said she would get back to me once the craziness in her life subsided. She also said if she had any ""down time"" she would prefer time alone and an opportunity to recharge. I think she is very honest and would not, let's say, begin dating a new person without reaching out me (at least, we agreed mutually to inform the other if we began dating).  

I really, really like her. When we were together, we worked in perfect harmony. I think she knows this. She also said I was not like any man she's ever been with; unique. I made her relax and savor moments. What do I do now? I have consciously avoided reaching out to her or ""checking in"" with her. I do not want to create the perception of neediness - something I know ISTJs loathe. At the same time, I want her to know that I am here and will remain here.

ISTJ,"Last year, I developed a small crush on my friend/flatmate who is an ISTJ. It was complicated though because I was already in a relationship and my new feelings for him lead to me ultimately deciding to end things with my ex boyfriend. After that things were kinda more flirty between us/there was almost some kind of tension. I asked about some of the signs he was giving off before previously on this sub and a lot of people said that he probably liked me. 

Unfortunately this all took place before a national lockdown, so we were forced to go back to our parents houses. I didn‚Äôt tell him how I felt as I was still processing my breakup but we still talked frequently over the months that followed and we‚Äôd skype quite frequently along with our other friends. 

After coming back to university, we‚Äôre living together again but this is his final year. I graduate next year. Things seemed more on the friendly vibe this year rather than flirty. He was using dating apps but not really getting a lot of luck. I just wanted to focus on my uni work mainly this year. 

At one point we talked about relationships and types etc. We both said we don‚Äôt have a type. He‚Äôs never had a girlfriend and he‚Äôs only been on one date. I‚Äôve had one 11 month relationship. He said he‚Äôd never believe that anyone could actually ever have a crush on him. I still kinda like him even though I know nothing will probably come out of it. I‚Äôm content being just friends and I‚Äôm happy being single again. I‚Äôm an INFP btw, and he‚Äôs said himself he‚Äôs not very emotional. From what I can tell he‚Äôs got a dismissive-avoidant attachment style which probably wouldn‚Äôt be good for my idealistic nature. One thing I‚Äôve noticed is he almost softens his analytical emotionless exterior around me. Like he‚Äôs never said or done anything purposefully to undermine me or hurt my feelings. 

I was wondering if it would be a good idea or not to tell him how I feel? I don‚Äôt expect him to say anything really or even feel the same way. But since he‚Äôs graduating in six months anyway I feel like there‚Äôs nothing to lose, and getting it off my chest would help me to move on from those feelings if that makes sense? I don‚Äôt want to risk making things awkward or ruining our friendship though so I‚Äôm conflicted.

I like to be with close friends (If i have any) but i also like to have my space.
I feel good helping others and i try to be the change i want to see in the world.
Sometimes people remember thing i did as a ""nice"" thing without i even know i did a ""nice"" thing untill they tell me.
I can describe and explain anything in an easy way (Anything from the real world) but it's really difficult to me express my thoughts and feelings (I don't like to do it).
I like to learn anything and i hope someday i could be a polymath (Polymath =/= Generalist).
I have social anxiety (For real). I don't like small talk and fake people. I prefer have no friends rather have ""friends"". When i try to meet new people and be nice all start well but then they hurt me in some way.
Other things i like: Videogames, movies, books (i don't use to read 'cause i don't have so many time and when i have i'm tired or my eyes are), photography, philosophy, thinking, overthinking lol, traveling at night, feeling the cold breeze and other stuffs i don't remember right now.

ISTJ,"Of course it's healthy, and important even, to be or to have a little competitiveness in you if you're competing for a position at a job or something....... otherwise you won't get anywhere. 

but there is such a thing as ""over competitiveness"", and personally I've never understood the concept of it, whether it's in video games (within groups of friends or family obviously) or group games/activities, I've always been the type of person who does their best at/with what they're assigned, and if I (or the group I'm in) don't win, cool, if i (or we) do win, also cool. 

It seems like there's always the ""over the top"" player/s who, if they win, they don't miss a chance to rub it in your face every 5 seconds, or if they lose, depending on how loud or quiet they normally are, they either rage and keep raging the more they lose(and if they win after losing they rub it in even more and harder than if they'd won the first time), or put on a 10km long pout that lasts however long they're salty for xD 

And to both these types I've always either thought, or told (depending on who they are) to ""just chill dude, relax, no need to get up all in my face, we're literally just doing this for fun, so just have fun, no need to get all pissy and toxic about it"" and as much as I don't want to believe they're the majority, almost all my experiences when it comes to ""fun time"" have had at least one of those people.

I was just having flashback thoughts and realized ""I don't really get that heated or competitive over games, why is that?"" so I thought I'd ask here and see if it's ""mbti related"" by any extent.",1612807572

ISTJ,"This post is not at all saying I am smarter or more adept, this deals with explicitly telling or asking someone something and they cannot register what you say and continue to do the opposite. It‚Äôs so frustrating. 

Example 1: I tell my hairdresser, please dye my hair this specific way I even touched my hair exactly where I wanted it to be done and made sure we were both on the same page. Also, I wear glasses so when she‚Äôs doing my hair I can‚Äôt see what she‚Äôs doing. She dyes then washes my hair and she had done exactly what I told her not to do and even changed the color of my 3x bleached over hair as if it could take any more damage. Then, I say I don‚Äôt want my hair blowdried at all and she confirms this with me, as it adds more unnecessary damage, and she literally proceeds to blow dry the only bleached section of my hair. I was so flustered and frustrated I stayed silent and left right afterwards. I am not a confrontational person and I need to work on that. 

Example 2: The same day I email my immunology professor about interactions in the GI tract with innate immune cells asking very specific questions about a receptor and it‚Äôs mutations. She emails me back telling me ‚Äòwhy yes that cell you picked out is an immune cell!‚Äô and proceeds to not answer my specific questions and rambles about other things. 

I am just blown away at the inability to read and respond to explicit expectations or questions. Nothing I asked for was at all incomprehensible especially for people with great expertise in these areas. I‚Äôm probably being over dramatic, but dang this is frustrating.

ISTJ,"For some context, I am applying for a doctorate in various universities. One of my potential supervisors is an ISTJ, he also was my MA supervisor, so I have known him for quite some time. 

I have been working on this project for over half a year now, and he has been giving me feedback, because the idea was to apply at his university as well with him as a supervisor. Three months ago I sent him the a draft, and he didn't get back to me except for saying that he had received it and that he'll look at it. I don't like to bother people and I trusted him to get back to me once he was ready (I have never sent him reminders, he is very diligent and punctual), but it's been *three months* so today I sent him an email asking if he has any additional feedback (even just saying if the project was ready for submission, so that I would be done with it). It's not even a long project, about 6 pages, so it won't take him more than 20/25 mins at max to read it. He replies saying that my project is excellent and asking me to make it a bit shorter, but hasn't left any suggestion or made any changes to my proposal. At this point I am assuming that if I had not emailed him, he would have never gotten back to me. Now I have missed all funding deadlines, so I won't be able to apply to any program this year. I am genuinely surprised, and a bit disappointed. If he didn't want to be my supervisor anymore, why didn't he simply said so? I wouldn't have relied on his feedback and I would have applied only to other universities with the project I had written, and I would have understood his choice. I am genuinely very grateful for his help and I was not expecting him to do so, so he had every right to say that he didn't want to supervise my project or help me at any point.

ISTJ,"Inferior Ne is usually associated with a fear of the unknown but I think that people often interpret this fear differently compared to the way I as an Si dom see it so I started wondering if other SJs experience it the same way I do or if it's just me. I know that some of the things are probably just stereotypes that many people aren't going to relate to anyway but I'd still like to know the extent to which other Si doms commonly relate to it. 

People often seem to think that being ""afraid of the unknown"" results in not wanting to expose oneself to anything that goes beyond one's experiences or what they perceive to be true and that this encapsulates both new concrete experiences as well as unfamiliar concepts or ideas. This typically makes others think that we're close-minded, set in our ways or aren't able to change our opinion on something just because of the way it has been in the past. Sometimes people also assume that we're by default judgmental or ignorant towards the unknown too. 

Contrary to what one may think about inferior Intuition, the fear I experience related to unfamiliar things is usually just concerned with specific physical matters (like going to a place I've never been to and that I know is going to overwhelm me or something like that) but I still think that it's important to expose yourself to things like that even if it seems scary at first. On the other hand, I don't experience any fear related to abstract concepts and if I encounter something new in that area then I'm more likely to want to read up on it and just be interested in it. I've also noticed that while the fear in itself remains, the specific scenario that I used to be afraid of usually doesn't bother me as much anymore after I know what to expect (even if it might take a bit longer to do so depending on what it is).

So how does the fear of the unknown relate to or affect you?",1611478250

Makoto ISTJ - Persona 5 Myers-Briggs Types

Makoto is a ISTJ girl and here's why, thanks for reading and share your opinions down below.

Makoto holds onto the past, cares about rules, honor, duty and tradition. She's logical and cares a lot about efficiency and is very headstrong and confident girl. She's also very calm and level headed person and a introverted girl as well. She's very detailed oriented, structured and organized as well, she's the classic ISTJ girl. She's a logical person and unemotional but even then she has a strong emotional side too with her ter Fi ands holds onto the past a lot with her dom Si. Useless came in her mind with Makoto's Si when Ann said it and she compared what she said to what Sae said to her last night. She has tons of flashbacks and said ""I'm not"" when she was thinking back on all that and those memories and was saying shes not useless as a person, her Si and Fi cared about these things strongly. 

She cares a lot about inner values and authenticity and wanted to be useful to someone with her strong Fi feelings. She struggles with accepting new things with her low Ne inferior and slowly throughout the game gets more open to new experiences and things outside her comfort zone, new possibilities are a struggle for her but she works on it and gets better. She's a very curious girl with her Ne and is a bit nosy when she follows you around so much, her Ne is curious of others and the outer world and it leads to her intelligence and desire for learning and gaining more information on things a lot. She's also good at brainstorming at times and can be pretty creative with some great ideas with her Ne. She's very headstrong and confident with her Te and cares a lot about efficiency and staying on task at all costs in a orderly logical fashion, she's a classic Te user. Later in the game she's extremely sweet and a amazing person. She's one of the best ISTJs of all time and she's a badass and incredible character and person. She's class president which is very fitting of the ISTJ personality as well among others. Love Makoto, she's the best. And her sister Sae Niijima is a ISTJ too.",1611254101

Some of the many lines that resonated with me:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""SiTe‚Äôs might relate to the idea of their brain being like an internal filing cabinet that stores the information they gather from the world in an organized fashion.

They are easily able to map out the details of what needs to happen to make an idea a reality, as long as the idea isn‚Äôt overly vague and opaque, as they have naturally linear thought pattern""

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""SiTe‚Äôs tend to have very high internal standards for themselves, which can cause them to focus on where they feel they‚Äôre falling short, even though those around them probably don‚Äôt demand the near-perfection they demand of themselves.""

  


&gt;""They may not have an easy time seeing their own intelligence because once they learn a complex, detailed system, they operate within it very well and it becomes simple to them. However, this is a talent that comes far more naturally to the SiTe than most other types.""

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""SiTe‚Äôs like to play ‚Äúby the book‚Äù. Any risks they take are likely to be very calculated, to the point that they probably aren‚Äôt very risky from their perspective because of their ability to conceptualize the logistics of the way their plans will work out.""",1611143849

Sojiro ISTJ - Persona 5 Myers-Briggs Typings

Wanted to see what the ISTJs thought of this one.

Let's type Sojiro shall we from Persona 5, heres my short analysis on why I type him ISTJ from the game.

He cares a lot about responsibility and rules and expects others to follow them. He cares a lot about duty, tradition, and security with his Si as a ISTJ. He's very stern and a very serious man. He's calm, introverted, and level headed person and mostly to himself even if he has a strong social side as well, in general though he's very much a calm introverted quiet person as a whole. He cares a lot about efficiency with his Te and loves giving orders without hesitation to people like Joker in the game as we see countless times with the tons of bossy orders he gives him. He's pretty logical and cold and very unemotional as a person and a bit harsh, blunt, and to the point with his words and how he is.

He's very serious and strict and has inner Fi values on things personally to him like not keeping a guys number in his phone and his values toward women over men and his Si can also point to him valuing tradition with gender roles here with why he wont put a guys phone number in his contacts as well. He can be a bit uptight and struggles with new things and possibilities as a Ne inferior user but sometimes he can be lenient and let up and be open to new experiences and things when he's forced too. A good example of letting Morgana the cat stay even if he made it a rule on himself and others of no pets allowed here. Sojiro cares a lot about rules and duty and focuses on past details to a very large extent with his Si and sternness. He's a good guy deep down and has a soft side deep down as well but overall has a rough and serious demeanor and is a very logical person who cares about security and following the rules at all costs and keeping out of trouble and worries what might happen if you don't with his Ne inferior function as a ISTJ.

He remembers details very well, is very good a comparing and contrasting things and does it often with his Si and again cares a lot about rules and guidelines and people following them as he says again when he does all this as he tastes your coffee in the game. ""It seems like you're following all the rules and instructions I gave you."" Classic Si coming out in Sojiro here. He constantly focuses on the past with things like you being trouble and having a criminal record and just can't let it go amusingly and always brings it up to you, ""I can't believe this kid in front of me is a troublemaker with a criminal record,"" he says right after his I'm surprised you followed the rules line.

He knows what wants and goes for it and that already the biggest turn-on for me. I've recently moved for education purposes and he still there, he still texts me to see when I visite so we can ""hang out"", but iv read your type u guys only invest in people you see a possibility or a future with and I'm not the committing type, not to learn term forever ships uno. but u see but I like him ( just as we are )  this is making me think if he eventually wants to aim in the more serious path or does he just enjoy my ahem ahem  ""company"" if that was the case then why hasn't he just moved to someone else ( i don't live in the capitol anymore), I wouldn't mind I find with us just being F buddies really, he doesn't seem like the type to have difficulty getting girls. 

I kinda have to arrange my time if I want to see him bc it the least I can do and he always space for me regardless of his busy schedule, so I dunno is he investing in me?  or's it just cus it covid and I'm somewhat the closet thing available ?. I can usually read ppl well and tell where I stand in the relationship but I cant t with him.

ISTJ,"Hi all,

I want to know if other ISTJ's are struggling with the same issue: I don't really have close friends. 

I (F28) do have friends as such, people I text with and hang out with every now and then, but not really friends that I'm really close with, who I could call in the middle of the night, who'd know everything about me, who I could tell anything etc. Not that there's anything wrong with my current friends, I just don't seem to be able to achieve that level of closeness with them. 

I'd say the things preventing me from making closer friends are my inability to show that I care and love, as well as judging people, not staying in touch, not wanting to really show my true feelings (my SO is the only person I can cry in front of) and ""let people close"". I have been described as a cold person, which I suppose I am to a degree. Not ideal for making friends..

Most of the time I'm ok with things, but sometimes it makes me sad when I see people having fun with friends they clearly are very close with.. Has anyone else experienced this and have you managed to work on it?

ISTJ,"Hi, 

I‚Äôm needing your advice if you can give out any. 

I‚Äôm an INTJ and I recently got my heart broken by an ISTJ. We talked online 10 months ago and hit it off. We live in different countries, 2 hours away. Because of COVID, my country has the tightest restriction and international travel is screwed. 

1. He went to my country 11 months ago before COVID, dated a girl here. They liked each other, promised to date each other when she came to his country in Sept. 2020 but couldn‚Äôt. 

2. 10 months ago, I randomly messaged him on a dating app and we hit it off. We shared each other: life stories, visions, movies chats,... I felt like we connected to a level. He felt the same. 

- I got attracted to him even though I knew it was illogical. 
- We shared many intimate conversations together. How intimate? I Was naked in front of him, emotionally and physically 
- We talked about things we could do together (weekend sex, drinking and chatting all night) when I came to meet him
- I never exclusively said I loved him because I wanted us to meet to confirm everything
- I encouraged him to go out, meet other girls and see life in different angles
- We are basically best friends. I treasure him as a human being. I don‚Äôt want to lose him.

3. Last 2 weeks, the girl came to his country to study Master‚Äôs. He went out with her for 2 dates, attempted to hold her hand (physical Touch Is his primary love language). When I told him about my plan coming to his country and probably stay there for a few months in March, he asked me to rethink and told me everything:

- He said he loved me very much but couldn‚Äôt love me as a girlfriend because we haven‚Äôt met
- He lost sleep, got anxiety in the past week because he was afraid he did the wrong thing (he got messed up in relationship in the past)
- I told him to date other girl because that‚Äôs the most logical thing to do (he‚Äôs already dating her so)
- He said he was afraid he‚Äôd lose me and lose everything. He wasn‚Äôt sure the girl was worth his time. 

4. Now, I‚Äôm totally crushed. 

- I‚Äôm lost at dating game. I knew LDR is stupid. I included him in my lifelong plan despite that. I blamed my inferior Fe and strong Ni. 
+ Was it my fault I misread him? He never loved me as a girlfriend but I acted like one in front of him?
+ Did he actually care for me as a human being or he just used me for emotional needs?
+ How can I trust my ability in dating again?
- I feel crushed at my incompetence to meet his needs, this hurts the most
- I feel like I truly lose him as a friend because I know once he‚Äôs committed with her, he won‚Äôt keep in touch with me. But he reassures me that he will keep in touch
- I can‚Äôt trust people again
5. Now I‚Äôm in shambles. 
- I keep myself busy, but can‚Äôt stop thinking about all this. It‚Äôs just life anyways but it sucks.
- How can I meet him again without things become so awkward? 
- Or should I do myself a favor and date other people because ‚Äúpeople come, people go‚Äù

Please give your insights.",1610276247

Yesterday he was particulary relaxed and he got even kind romantic, after some teasing and light flirting between the both of us suddenly he put a song ""cassually"" and ask me to pay attention to it and tell him what I felt, turns out that the song was a declaration of love, I told him I really like it and we talked and talked till the day was over but I never told him what I really thought about it, because I was a mess of emotions inside and I had to digest first all that happened. The thing is when today I finally took courage to clearly tell him how I felt (after all the proof he has given me I told him ""I believe I'm falling in love with you"" he answered me lacking warmth in his text. He didn't sent me any emoji as he did it the other day (he has sent me red hearts before), but this time he told me a bland ""thank you, I am glad you liked the song I shared to you"" and ""thank you my (insert the pet name he gave me)"" but he didn't put any emoji or something. Literally my message was like 12 lines and his answer was four fucking lines. I felt confused and even kinda hurt because to me is EXTREMELY difficult to open up to someone and even less admit what I truly feel under my ""cold and composed exterior"". I was refusing to show him or give him any sing I truly liked him but literally all my close friends and family said he was being direct about being in love with me and I was the slow one that never got the idea of what was going on.

INFP: I feel more like ENFP than INFP and inferior Si fits me better than inferior Te. But I still consider this because of my fear of being INFP stereotypes.

ISTJ,"Hi everyone,

ENFP (M) here. I‚Äôve been with my ISTJ partner for over 15 years. We have 4 kids together, and overall, she‚Äôs been an amazing mother and partner.

However, we‚Äôve had several bumps in our marriage in reference to our relationship. If you‚Äôve ever heard of love languages, or anything related to that, you‚Äôll know that people have different ways of expressing and receiving love. Some demonstrate love through acts of service, some through quality time, others through gift giving, words of affirmation and/or physical touch.

I assume most ISTJs are gift givers and acts of service, at least that‚Äôs what she is.

I am more of a words of affirmation and physical touch.

We‚Äôve recently had a conversation where I‚Äôve expressed my frustration with lacking fulfillment in those areas (physical touch and words of affirmation). During the conversation, my ISTJ said something peculiar, about how when we first got married she had to train me to fulfill her love language by reminding me and asking me to do things around the house for her. Today, she doesn‚Äôt even have to ask me because I can see and know what is necessary to do and how I can show her love in those ways - cooking dinner, doing the laundry, fixing things around the house, etc. She also said she didn‚Äôt need my touch all the time because she was content with just being in the same room together. I told her all of those things were fine and good to know, but that wasn‚Äôt fulfilling me.

Her response was that I should train her like she trained me in my love language. In other words, tell her when to hug me, when to rub my back, when want to be messed with, and to even say to her when I need to hear that she loves me.

It‚Äôs a bit disappointing because I assumed, after being together for this long, she would already know when I needed those things.

What makes everything a bit trickier is 4 kids who constantly overwhelm her with noise and attention, so I don‚Äôt want to add more to my beautiful ISTJs stress. However, after having that conversation, I‚Äôm afraid I did.

She now basically feels like she‚Äôs not enough, especially with two kids who‚Äôs love language is like mine, and so I told her I didn‚Äôt want to put that pressure on her. And that leaves me unfulfilled.

Anyway, I am an INFP and I just wanted to ask some questions, get some answers, and say hello. I have always seen STJ types as very logical and rational, whereas NFP types are more abstract. What I have noticed is your subreddit has a lot of questions and fewer memes and images than that of NFPs. I envy you guys quite a bit. From what I have seen, you are told to be planners and very intelligent. I often wish I could make a plan and stick to it. Most of the time I only do what must be done when I am threatened by a deadline. 

I have some questions for you all:

1. Not necessarily a question, but, describe yourself. What are you like? What do you do for fun? I want to know about your life.
2. What are your thoughts on ENFPs or INFPs? Do you find them irrational and ditzy due to our vast differences? Or do you envy our whimsy and abstract thinking? Can you relate to us at all?
3. If you could change one thing about yourself, what would it be? Why?

Examples:

*My ISTJ psychiatrist never agree, that my borderline personality disorder is treatable and not life longing. Even though I was at konference, where much more knowledgeable person spoke and was contradicting my psychiatrist. My psychiatrist stayed stubborn after that, viewing any of my ideas as verification for BPD. Also my psychiatrist is in love with antipsychotics and view them as a cure to everything. He is so stubborn, because he thinks, that this is 100% genetics.*

*I also have ISTJ father, who just could not understand, that my mother wanted to preserve one flower in the garden, but father always cut it. Also we were getting gifts for Chrismass, but we always got gifts, that we disliked. It happened more times, I always wanted to have short ski (said to him), but I got longer and longer ski each year. I just cannot comprehend, why was it happening.*

ISTJ,"I think people who are in these categories can assess me and figure out if I land here LOL

So, I took this test like 5 months ago and scored INTJ-T, which I believed was so accurate that it made me cry. I had always been disconnected from others ‚ÄîI was basically just an ass‚Äî and always found new hobbies and things to learn. Loved solving problems and reading about complex topics, but still had a pessimistic approach on everything. I was always pushing myself in short bursts.. out of fear of being in an insecure spot?? Idk anyways,

My dog died two weeks ago, and prior to that ‚ÄîI had been reading a lot of astrology and psychology books to better understand my partner. After seeing death (I had watched the euthanasia) a switch just flipped in my head that made me want to appreciate the people around me more. Not because I love them? or have deep feelings or them... simply off of the fact that I don‚Äôt want to be sad and have regrets if I ever lose them.

Every decision I make is based off of my own beneficiary. Even if I skip out on a good meal for myself so that I can put the money into a friend‚Äî I simply view it as me having good points with them sooner. Or if I help a someone out at work, it‚Äôs never because I actually feel for them ‚ÄîI just don‚Äôt want to get caught in it and regret not helping.

But anyways, I retook it LOL

I score literally 3% away in the TvS from being ISTJ and ISFJ and the results are always interchanging. I do consider peoples‚Äô feelings when I make decisions and when I go about things, but I still center most of the ‚Äúgood deeds‚Äù that I do for others, around myself.

I have adapted to talk to certain people in my life though. Rather than try to offer them a solution and get impatient, I do take a step back to understand their characters and how me saying the wrong thing could negatively affect my reputation or their image of me.

I don‚Äôt like sentimental/handmade gifts unless they‚Äôre useful or nice‚Äîand I‚Äôm very work consumed and don‚Äôt always find quality time necessary. I hate small talk, but tbh I‚Äôm pretty good at it if need be, or if it would benefit me.",1609281579

* A random thing can make me replay a completely random memory and

* My tendency to worry about COVID-19 (That's my ONLY source of stress)

This may or may not be inferior Ne or any other inf function: I was going to eat my lunch outside but I couldn't take off my mask and simply eat it because what if I catch COVID for no reason? I also couldn't even throw the paper into trash because yet again, what if I catch COVID for no reason? That was my ONLY fear at that time. Hyperfocus. Then, I ranted about that to my family and I couldn't let it go. It felt like I deceived myself. I thought I was a pretty relaxed person and now I need to consider myself unhealthy? I was stuck in the past for a while and then, it went away. I also considered ""I'll never wear mask, get COVID and face my fear head-on!""

ISTJ,"
My boyfriend (54M, ISTJ) and I (27F, ENFP) have been together for 4 months. Short time, I know. He invited me to move in with him after the first date and we have been inseparable ever since. I can honestly say he is one of the best boyfriends I have ever had. We do have a great sexual life and friendship but it‚Äôs being increasingly up ended by my feelings towards him always insisting on using a condom or no sex. I‚Äôm jealous of his ex lovers that he didn‚Äôt use a condom with and feel like he doesn‚Äôt trust me when I‚Äôve given him no reasons not to and / or I‚Äôm not attractive enough (men are more likely to not use condoms with women who are more attractive.) 

He didn‚Äôt use condoms with a lot of his ex girlfriends because he said they were on the pill and this makes me incredibly jealous, upset and like I‚Äôm not good enough.  My feelings about it are a bit heightened as I am PMSing right now. This morning, I spoke to him in depth about only using condoms the two weeks surrounding ovulation and going condomless near my period. From a science standpoint, the rhyme method when done right is more effective than the pill and I am proof of that (more on this below.) We fantasy talk about doing it raw but when I sat down and spoke to him at length about the rhyme method and using condoms at certain points of the month and always pulling out, he said he never wants to not use a condom. This made me very upset and I honestly don‚Äôt know what to do. My attraction level towards him dropped dramatically.

On the one hand, we don‚Äôt have important long term goals that align. He has never been married and never wants to have any kids. I would like to have a kid someday. From the start I told him he‚Äôs just a temporary boyfriend as these are non-negotiable for me in a long term relationship sense. But I‚Äôve been falling for him more and more and I guess I‚Äôm just hurt that he doesn‚Äôt want to share the level of intimacy that goes with making love raw. 

I‚Äôve had three forms of birth control fail on me. I‚Äôve been pregnant on ortho triclene lo, yaz and a mirena IUD. All hormonal birth-control that I thought would protect me when my ex partners came inside me ...but I guess not. The last pregnancy with mirena was very traumatic as it was an ectopic pregnancy that resulted in emergency surgery to remove my ruptured Fallopian tube. Statistically, my fertility is down +/- 15% from only having one Fallopian tube. My longest relationship was 5 years and we always relied on the pull out and rhyme method and I never got pregnant. I thought compromising with my current boyfriend with condoms near ovulation would be fair based on what we are both comfortable with. 

I‚Äôm in no shape or form ready to start a family nor do I really think he would be a good parent. I don‚Äôt work out, I drink alcohol, I smoke weed and I haven‚Äôt reached my financial goals. He is obviously a lot older than me and pretty set in his ways. I would like to become a parent in my mid-30s. To be clear, I am not the type of person to force someone to do something they don‚Äôt want to and I think this would be obvious to him at this point in our relationship. 

Our time together has been really great but I‚Äôm so worked up right now that I can‚Äôt really think straight and just feel very blah towards him at this moment in time. I‚Äôve decided to not talk to him for a little while until I have more time process this. 

I would like some advice on how to proceed, especially if some of you have some similar experiences.",1609276057

I'm someone who enjoys writing thoughtful words of appreciation and letters to my SO, saving every meme he would enjoy and sending it to him, and buying him practical and thoughtful gifts. My SO on the other hand, I notice, would fill my water bottle up without me asking, would get up in the middle of the night to wrap me in an extra blanket because he knows I get cold, and makes sure to call me every night before bed. Luckily, we both share the value of putting our phones down when we're together. 

It's definitely interesting to see the differences in how we show our love. My ISTJ is a lot shyer when expressing his affection outwardly (has a hard time saying ""I miss you,"" ""I love you,"" and stuff even if he feels it). He definitely has a difficult time with words in general. He's physically affectionate at home, but doesn't like holding hands in public.

ISTJ," This guy is a successful salesman - he is successful in part due to his great interpersonal skills (he is charismatic and you sense when speaking to him that he wants to get to know you, even though he is making a sale,) and his ambition (he has always wanted to be financially stable due to wanting to live a gratifying life without having to worry about money - his father often spoke about saving money when he was growing up - and he is partly ambitious due to wanting to help his wife out in providing for their three children. He does not want them to be too spoiled, and knows that his wife works hard in regards to her own job, but understands that it takes two great incomes to maintain their home and help pay for what their kids need. He genuinely cares about his wife and supporting her, as he sees her hard work and partly works so hard in regards to his own job to lend her a helping hand, and to ensure that he is a good role model for his own children.) He always likes to ensure that he knows at least a bit about a product before he tries selling it to be safe/avoid feeling anxious, though he has been able to sell products in the past even when he did not know a great deal about the product due to his aforementioned charisma (he can honestly be a \*bit\* manipulative when selling products, but not in a malicious way in the slightest...)

His social skills help him out a great amount in regards to his job as a salesman; he has always been popular amongst groups of people, even going back as far as elementary school - he aimed to be popular in elementary school as he felt in his household that since he was the middle child, his spotlight was stolen by his older brother, or his younger sister. He aimed to be known for being ""cool"" and him being so personable led to him being voted in class president against the richest girl in school. He did enjoy hearing gossip (and still does, honestly,) but does not necessarily partake in it (i.e. he does not really speak negatively about other people unless he dislikes someone - and he is honest about it when he dislikes people, though not too blunt - but he does enjoy hearing about the business of others from friends.) Although he has never been what some would consider to be dumb, he maintained average grades whilst in elementary and middle school due to not having a serious interest in the subject matter - however, since he ended up dating (and later on marrying,) the smartest girl in his grade (he was interested in her due to her being pretty, kind, and finding her intelligence attractive... he liked that she was always helping he and other people out, yet also capable of solving nearly any problem,) he asked her in high school to help him raise his grades, as he understood that he needed to start maintaining higher grades in order to start seriously looking at a career (he also saw his girlfriend succeeding academically and wondered, on some level, why he deserved her. He wanted to be the guy that she deserved to have, or at least this was how he thought of it, and also wanted to help himself out career-wise.)

He actually committed to raising his grades with her help, even though it was difficult at first to maintain a consistent studying routine as he always wanted to sit down and relax after school, or head out with some friends. He had always maintained a healthy romantic relationship with her even whilst dating due to being willing to talk out different issues with her (she had to start the conversation, but he was open to it and willing to listen, as he really did want to make things work.) He did end up attending a good school in regards to college due to his dedication, and even though he did care for her, he and his aforementioned girlfriend agreed to break off their relationship for a little while due to attending different schools (he was upset about this, but tried dating two other people in college, as did she... only to find that it didn't ""feel the same"" and that he missed her too much. She would later on report feeling the same.) After graduating, he re-connected with his former girlfriend due to understanding based upon his other two relationship experiences that she was his best match (and hoping that she still felt the same - she did!)

He found his first sales job through a social connection (through a buddy of his,) as he ensured that he networked throughout college (partly due to his aspirations, and this was partly natural - he is the kind of person who would have made connections no matter what school he went to,) and although he did have some fun as he learned more about the sales world, he still made sure to take his job seriously, as he knew that he wanted a future with his girlfriend and financial stability. He moved up in the ranks due to his social skills and interest in improving at the job, and married his girlfriend - he, of course, begun to work harder and harder after their kids were born. However, he recalled his own father having been a workaholic, and feeling that he didn't get to know him as well as he could have due to this (and feeling that his father was boring and only ever rambled about money); for this reason, although he makes sure that he establishes boundaries with his kids (he, along with his wife, encourages them to maintain at least average grades in school and undoubtedly parents them,) he still successfully gets to know his children as people and pays attention to them. He has a genuine relationship with each of his children, and even though he can be direct with them at times, is loved by them - he is usually understanding of their feelings, yet does not tolerate disrespect from them toward he or his wife and is clear about this.

ISTJ,"Hello, I will sum up this as much as possible and apologise me for my broken English..

Im 22 yo INTP female broke up with my ISTJ 25yo, We both from concernative communities and this is our first relationship, we have been dating for 3 months. After that I have come to a conclusion that I love him but I absulotly don't like him so I need to end the relationship. 

I called him through a phone call,
and told him: "" I love you, but relationships can't stand on love alone, I think we are not suitable for each other"". 
And this was the second time me telling him we are not suitable, the first time he didn't even asked me why, but this time his reaction improved 
and he said: ""Again?! Why do you think we are not suitable for each other?"".
I said: "" you're perfect, there's nothing wrong with you, you're kind, handsome, well behaved, well mannerd, with a good financial state and above that all your commitment and dedication for the relationship is visible....."" here where he cut me off and said: ""its my bad for being that good"" and hang off the phone..

As someone who loved him I feel bad for breaking his heart, I can tell he was deeply in love with me, he was giving this relationship all his heart.. but at the same time I have my doubts that he was in love with our status as lovers not with me specifically. Finnaly, I feel too bad for this open ending.. I couldn't say why we are not suitable for each other, and I couldnt understand his reaction, he was too emotional...

Here why I think we're not suitable for each other:

1. I'm always under a stressful strong pressure to say ""YES"", ""FINE"", ""YOU ARE COMPLETLY RIGHT"".

2. He doesn't like to be criticised or disagreed with. Which makes everything hard.

3. My thoughts doesn't matter as long as he believes he's doing the right thing for me.

4. Even if it reaches to the point I'm not comfortable, I'm hurt or I'm asking him to change his mind, he keeps going with what he thinks is right.

5. He does understand how much pressure he's applying on me (I'm trying to make it as clear as possible to him) and he might apologise, but he never showed an actual action to do what I want.

6. He might understand that I'm hurt and ignored it, that continued until I told him its not acceptable and it hurt me even more.. but this leads to nothing cuz even if he asked me why are you sad.. I cant be open enough to tell him.. I cant express myself to him..

7. He doesn't like to confront problems or going through serious deep conversations about problems. When I feel the closest after deep talking to solve our problems. 

8. He was way too romantic and has this lovely devely hopes and expectations about relationships, I couldnt be on the same wave as him on this matter. I'm not good at sweet talk, he was rushing things and I couldnt go on the same speed as him. 

9. Finally, I wasn't able to express myself openly and thats why I dont think he was in love with me. He was in love with being with a girl that he thinks is perfect (I'm not thought..).

These things made me sad, crying continuously for weeks, I was happy when I was hanging out with him, I went a lot with the flow and with what he wanted, however I was rethink and overthink everything.. my mind and heart were fighting all the time..

Now.. my problem is that I'm holding a stupid hope that he will come back to know why we are not suitable.. how can I get over this hope? Also I'm somehow have this feeling like we can get back and solve things..
This is by the way my heart not mind, my mind thinks this is a losing case.. 

And I'm kinda of depressed, is it really too hard for an INTP female to find someone she will be happy with? I'm on a point where I think I'm too complicated, hard  and no one ever would be able to make me happy..",1609054556

She is known for being one of the most, if not the most, intelligent women in the city she lives in (she had grown up there, even though she was born in another state and lived elsewhere whilst attending college,) and was class valedictorian in high school due to her academic prowess (she has always been competitive in regards to academics, and was a typical ""good student"" whilst in school - had perfect attendance every year except one, always scored high on tests, maintained the highest GPA of any student in the school in her high school and even before that, won the ""Student of the Year"" award multiple times, etc.) She struggled with being a people-pleaser and pushover when young due to naturally being nice (though she was devious enough to go along with/assist in her best friend's pranks, even though some of their classmates were not,) and having some self-esteem issues, but started to steadily become more confident in middle school and high school. She has always been confident in regards to her logical conclusions, though, as she has always understood that she is smart, and prided herself on being known as ""the smart one"" amongst her peers. She was a very high-achieving student in high school with great extracurriculars and grades - although she considered a few different paths, she ultimately decided that she wanted to study neuroscience due to feeling that the area was a perfect intersection of the physical and the abstract, in addition to wanting to learn more about biology/the human brain and feeling that the field had the potential to transform human health (she also realized in her sophomore year that she tended to dedicate a fair amount of time to reading about the brain and its functions, even though she did read up on a great number of other subjects.)

She attended a top school and graduated as one of the first in her class there due to her dedication to studying the topic - she met up with the guy who she had dated for many years from elementary school to high school (who is the extroverted salesman that she is married to,) and begun dating him again, as although she tried dating someone else (as did he,) in university, she found that there had not been the same level of comfort and understanding as there had been in her relationship with him. They ended up marrying and she had three children with him, though she ensured that she found work before she became pregnant, and begun a savings account with her husband in order to make sure that their kids would have college funds/enough money in general. As a mother, she is great, even though she did have some concerns about her potential parenting - she is self-aware in regards to most mistakes that she may be making/have made as a parent, but is actually a very good mother. She ensures that her kids maintain at least average grades in school (she is not too hard on them about this, though she is still clear about her expectations,) and that they are actively learning - she encourages them to read, introduces and encourages different kinds of learning styles, brings in game-based learning, etc. She does want them to maintain good grades, as she does think about their futures and wants to set the kids onto a path of success in the world (though she understands that it is about more than simply ending up with a high-paying job, and does not pressure them into choosing a certain career, but rather tries to help them explore different options and encourage them to move toward what they are actually interested in,) but is also concerned about them actually learning, and keeps a library of books in the house. She is very well-read on important aspects of a child's development, and also encourages a healthy social life amongst her kids, making sure that they have friends and understand social etiquette. She likes to keep a schedule, but is still willing to move along when things do not go according to plan, even though it can make her a bit uncomfortable/anxious.

She is conventionally attractive, and aware of this - she styles herself in a certain way due to understanding that as a woman, she is being judged by many based upon her physical appearance (she will begin talking about the Halo Effect and different studies when her children ask,) and encourages all of her children to be well-groomed/take care of their physical appearance for this reason (particularly her daughter, as she knows that it will be more important for her, but she is not nitpick-y in regards to her children's appearances, and simply encourages them to look presentable whilst also encouraging them to not be shallow.) She does know how to set healthy boundaries in regards to her children. She is usually the person who cooks for the family (she sets a specific time for this,) and particularly makes healthy foods, as she finds it important based upon her readings for the people in the house to have a balanced diet (they complain about this, though she lets them order takeout from time to time.) She is usually patient with her children, and even though they do not always show their appreciation for her, they undoubtedly love and value her.

ISTJ,"I feel weird.I guess,this is all. So,i think i should start.

Approximately a year and a half ago i came to the new class with different ppl.Before,in the previous class,i was very quiet,i just didn't like them all,it is just the Si-Fi loop of mine,when i understood all the system is wrong,and when i will get out of the village to the bigger city with smarter ppl everything will be cool.But it wasn't.The ppl were very smart,quick thinking,and they didn't give a damn about me,cause everyone was,as i call it now,""free"" in this sence. So,i quiclkly found out this pattern of that ppl normally don't give a shi about others,so tried to follow it.But,deeply inside,i needed that attention,and i tried to do it with,oh my god,the worst decision i've ever done,i think...So,it was using Ne.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to be like NT's,i don't know,it seemed ""cool"",it gave me the feeling of being special.I also gave myself very conflicting standarts,cause my subconscious wanted one,while conscious needed another(simple example : i have finally destroyed my life and haven't been seeing sense in anything(Ne gripping).Just anything.But,again,we are ppl,and we need something. So,i needed that confidence in my future,so there were always conflicts with my principles,and no time to work upon them,cause all the force is gone to the chosing the ""for what"").So,thankfully,i have found out the decision.I have chosen to be...lawful\\neutral evil,i guess(even here - no concrete).

&amp;#x200B;

But,here,this is the nowadays period,i have totally lost myself.I am definitely a different person than i was before,i think my social skills became just incredible,and i am more honest with myself now and don't feel the need of attention that much.I also appreciate my class,they are indeed very good ppl,and i understood,that it is normal to not give a f about others.I became more chill,less moral(now i can joke upon someone,like some of my previous class students would do,but i won't regret,and i also think that even if someone will joke upon me,later,after i have seen he wants to make joking upon me a habit,i will just start to ignore him.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing here is that i don't have much motivation.Everything is cool,my relationships are cool,i can say whatever i want and no one will smile on me or i won't have problems with anyone.But everything seems so empty....I don't want to study,cause for what?I don't want to be the best person in the world,cause for what?And i don't try to be like someone another,cause my own identity is far better than that shitty character of others.But.I don't know,the who i am now....i don't know,what i want...oh,i am SUCH an other person now,i don't care for those little pointless details,for the expecations of others(if this isn't the person i count as worthy for it)....

ISTJ,"Posted this on r/INTJ, posting it here for more insight.

English is my second language so bear with me please. Tl;dr at the last paragraph.

I took the Sakinorva test and scored pretty high on both Ni (36.2%) and Si (34%) functions. I also got 35% on Te and 36% on both Fi and Ti. Got 20% on Ne, and 14% on both Se and Fe.

Got INTJ as Grant function type and Myers function type, but ISTJ as Myers-Briggs type with a faint S. I can relate very well to both Ni and Si functions, which is apparently unusual and not really supposed to happen, and I don‚Äôt understand what could be happening here. I‚Äôve tested as INTJ consistently for the past 6 years or so in every test I‚Äôve taken and I‚Äôve never doubted the results within years of researching MBTI, but now I‚Äôm questioning if I may be Si-dom instead of Ni-dom.

I‚Äôm drawn to history, culture and tradition and I really enjoy rules (as long as they make sense, and I analyze them on a case by case basis) and structure, I‚Äôm extremely focused and detail-oriented, I strongly dislike taking risks and I often reminisce about the past (especially my childhood, which I‚Äôm strongly clung onto). I feel like I‚Äôm a very trustworthy person to handle spreadsheets and stock-taking for instance, and I‚Äôm good with repetitive tasks. I‚Äôm very practical and I‚Äôd rather use old, tried-and-tested methods that I know work than switch things up (if it works, why change it?), however I try not to negatively impact my goals, efficiency and understanding of the truth by being too inflexible or perfectionistic. I dislike sarcasm and find it rude. I have been raised mostly by Si-dom mother, grandmother and older brother (all ISFJs), which are the people I have been closest to throughout my life.

However I‚Äôm also a very imaginative and future-oriented person at the same time. When I focus on a detail I tend to forget my surroundings and completely ignore the bigger picture; I may very easily miss something I‚Äôm looking for when it‚Äôs right in front of my nose, and I spend most of my time making up imaginary people and stories in my head. I tend to ramble a lot when answering questions instead of giving direct short answers, I go off-topic a lot and I like to explore and talk about abstract themes and multiple nuances of the same issue, which often warrants people getting confused and saying I speak ‚Äúnonsense‚Äù, or not getting the point. I struggle with expressing my ideas.

I‚Äôm a good strategist and I can usually predict the future very well (I say ‚ÄúI told you so‚Äù with embarrassing frequency), and I used to be the best student with the highest grades of all schools I‚Äôve attended despite being generally lazy and not very disciplined (missed class often, sometimes didn‚Äôt turn in assignments, never studied at home), which I attribute to good intuition and logic. I used to skip class a ton because school was boring, pointless and too easy for me for the most part and I got bullied by pretty much everyone; no friends there at all. I don‚Äôt usually notice or care a lot if the environment is physically messy, I guess because I live too much in my own head and am not really a sensor (?). I stumble on things often and my spatial/physical awareness sucks sometimes, especially when I‚Äôm uncomfortable or under pressure and in a place I don‚Äôt know very well. I tipically find conversations with xNxx types to be more pleasant and intelectually stimulating, as they tend to understand and enjoy discussing theories and abstract thoughts better than most sensors.

I‚Äôm not officially diagnosed but I display several traits associated with autism. I‚Äôm enneagram type 5w6 and tritype 531.

So which is it, mistyped ISTJ, INTJ with possibly autistic traits, typical INTJ, socially inept/immature ISTJ or something else entirely? Why and how do I score so high on Ni, Si, and Ti simultaneously?

ISTJ,"Hello everyone:

I recently started revisiting MBTI and realized that I may have mistyped myself. For years I got ISTP when I took tests. However, after walking away from this for a while and coming back, I realize that I might be an ISTJ. The IS part I am pretty sure about. It is the F/T and P/J part that I am not sure about. It seems to fluctuate depending on where I am and who I am with. There are aspects of ISTP/ISTJ/ISFP/ISFJ that I identify with based on the results from [www.personalityatwork.co](https://www.personalityatwork.co)

The reason I think I might be an ISTJ is this:

\- I am generally laid back, flexible, even-tempered, and reserved. However, I have this keen sense of time and stick to a schedule no matter what.

\- I like to plan things out in my head, focus on one thing at a time, and work slowly/methodically.

\- When I am at work, I prefer structure to my work day and hate it when people throw last minute emergencies at me (especially when I am trying to focus on something).

\- I also like structure when it comes to rules and learning how to accomplish tasks. Arbitrary rules frustrate the hell out of me, but I at least try to understand where they come from.

\- I am not a natural leader. However, when I have to perform leadership duties, I communicate pretty clearly what my expectations are and do my best not to leave room for interpretation.

\- I don't respect leaders that contradict themselves, set arbitrary rules, micromanage people for the sake of it, and don't lead by example.

Does this sound more ISTJ/ISTP/ISFP/ISFJ to you?

There's this 40-year-old woman I met years ago at an organization we both volunteered for. She was married with kids and I had a girlfriend and we both had lived our own separate lives, so we didn't really stay in contact.

About 1 to 2 years ago, she divorced from her husband. Around April this year my ex broke up with me.

I contacted her in June because I need real human contact. I remembered we got along quite well and I noticed she'd been going through a rough period herself after her divorce. So I figured we might be able to help each other with our company.

We've met 4 times since, at her place. In spite of not really knowing each other well, she shared some of the most personal things about her life. 3 out of 4 of those times we spent an entire afternoon and evening together, usually ending with a movie. 

I'm developing a romantic interest in this woman, but I can't tell if it's mutual or not. I'm not really good at recognizing when a woman is flirting with me and I can't really tell whether she feels comfortable sharing these personal things with me because she sees me like a brother or because she thinks of me as a potential love interest.

ISTJ,"my istj bf - he's very blunt - sometimes/ or quite frequently--- he says outloud about an actress or someone on tv like ""wow shes hott"". like obviously he's just making a comment and it's not like he's ever going to cheat with an actress but it still bothers me. with that said, i know ISTJs are very practical and logical but there's still that ounce of worry that he may potentially make similar comments or have similar thoughts with other girls we know-- specifically one type I'm worried about. -- particularly a type he's been attracted to before-- outgoing, nice, flirty. There's this girl he recently hung out w in a group setting of 3 ppl total. They are not close friends but they've hung out twice in this setting through his friend (whom the girl is hooking up w). BF told me that shes fun to hang out with, but told me explicitly it's not like he'd date her anyway. But given how much he seems to fluctuate on his words in general, I'm still pretty cautious. Not that I mind him hanging out w another female in a group setting but more so the fact that that girl has the reputation of being a ""hoe"", and how her potential influences on him could impact us negatively. Realistically speaking, I know I probably shouldn't worry too much given they never see each other but I'd like some insight.",1608434277

When I sit down with my friends and we talk about dreams and goals in life, they keep on telling me about their dreams that only benefit them. Now, I'm not judging anyone for wanting that for themselves because that is normal but I can't relate.

ISTJ,"My istj friend (more than a friend) isn‚Äôt expressive about his thoughts and that irked me a lot, it was like I‚Äôm door slammed. 

I‚Äôm INTJ and we are in long distance relationship because of the pandemic. We normally have our usual Friday nights for virtual drinks together and intimate conversations in the past 9 months. 2 weeks ago, I picked up a sign that he wasn‚Äôt satisfied with our conversations anymore, mainly because he demands physical touch which Im not able to give. I told him what I thought about our relationship and asked him what was the best way he wanted and what I could help with that. He took a few days to answer that with a sorry that he sucked that it wasn‚Äôt my fault. We exchanged a few texts then he went ghost without giving me an actual answer what was going on with him. This situation happened once in May when he disappeared for a month and then hit me up like nothing happened. When I called him out for that, he said he was just really busy. 


For this time, I told him he could take time to sort his priorities and life out then he can hit me up when he‚Äôs ready but in the deep of my mind, I‚Äôm fed up with this. If only he said he would dip for a while then I‚Äôd happily live my life without worrying about him but no, he decided to keep everything to himself, like my opinions won‚Äôt matter.

Somewhere in my brain, there‚Äôs a scenario that he‚Äôs found a girl in his country that he likes so much but he doesn‚Äôt have a gut to leave me then he‚Äôd do all the drama like this. Even though I told him we could be friends and I would be happy if his difficult ass finds someone he likes and the person likes him back but judging as an ISTJ, he wouldn‚Äôt truthfully say anything and prefer a natural death for any relationship. 

How can I have a no drama conversation with him about this? Not just expressing my needs for open communication but I want to hold him accountable and also I think it‚Äôs really a bad trait that can sabotage any relationship he‚Äôs in.",1607668507

I've decided to create this survey out of pure fun and inquisitiveness because I've been curious to know whether there are correlations between MBTI type and sexuality, particularly with sexual preferences and attitudes toward sex.

ISTJ,"I [33M] have been really focused on advancing my education and career to a point where I had forgone social life and dating/love life. I was in a position to work hard, push myself to pull above my own weight due to family situation, did not feel I had enough to offer so at one point or another, isolated myself from other people.

I think I'm also a perfectionist where if one or two things don't align, then I hesitate in giving a shot. i.e) trying to date women or applying to jobs(I'm not done with my project, I'll apply when I'm close to finishing) so it doesn't help.

I started my higher education late (I went back in my late 20s after dropping out in early 20s to work extra) but again, social life was limited to making friends from class, going to networking or job hunting related events. However it paid off because I've secured an offer when I'm still months away from graduating with a very nice salary.

I now have education out of the way, locked in a job offer, I'm starting to think of dating again for the first time in a very long time and I'm kind of worried. Lonely but one thing I won't allow myself to become is a deadbeat, want to excel in what I do but I keep making excuses not to date because I'm maybe insecure about what I don't have, despite having a lot achieved.

I'm currently try to comprehend certainly which type I am. My scores are ISTJ or ISTP. I know it's crazy be uncertain between 2 types with completely different cognitive functions but I really don't know. Although I'm sure about my eneagram (8w9) and my tritype (863). I read almost every stereotypical traits of ISTJ and one of them is about have a really good memory. I can't relate! I dont remember what I had for lunch or what is the name of someone who I talked for the first time 5 minute ago. I'm a human Dory (Finding Nemo) lol! It's not so a big deal like this, but I realize that I can remember things by what I felt in that moment. So I think that I can't remember someone's name cause I really dont pay attention on what he/she says but on what he/she seems to me: his/her gesture, his/her face expressions. It's maybe a Se trait? 

Please, tell me if you relate on it!

ISTJ,"My (33F ESFJ) husband (33M ISTJ) have a pretty good relationship. He is very much an ISTJ in the terms of introversion, work ethic, family values, being a firm rock for our family, etc. One of the things I love about him is his secret goofy side. When he is around other people he is pretty stoic, preferring to listen rather than talk. However when it's just our son and/or me he has this childlike goofy humor. For example today our cat started meowing at nothing, so he picked her up and started cradling her while singing Rick Astley. 

We've been married almost nine years and on occasion I will tease him for having moments where he is a 70 year old man in a 33 year old body, and its something he owns proudly. Just last week we were talking about that again in terms of being an ISTJ trait, and asked if he was like that when he was younger too. He said yes, but said it was because he was never allowed to be a kid.

Suddenly the pieces fell into place. His mom (ISFP) is an absolutely wonderful woman and has been a good friend since we were dating, but his dad (ISFJ) has always been incredibly strict with him. He wasn't allowed to watch shows like Scooby Doo or movies like Home Alone (when I found out I immediately put it on), wasn't allowed to do activites he wanted to do like Karate, or play video games until he could buy his own system when he was a teen. In fact when we got married I remember him sheepishly asking if he could buy some of the remastered retro games. All he wanted to do was play games like Megaman, Sonic, Earthworm Jim, and other Zelda titles.

I was raised with an ESFJ mom and ENFJ dad who didn't care that I watched the Indiana Jones movies when I was five, played video games, or ran around the neighborhood unsupervised. They were always on call as they worked in surgery, so I was left alone at the house for hours at a time to entertain myself at a very young age. We had strikingly different childhoods despite being in the same income bracket, raised in the same religion, educations etc.

His father also suffered from undiagnosed depression for most of my husband's life, so he was never really there emotionally. When our son was born he said he would not be the type of father his was.

With all that said when he told me he was never allowed to be a child it really hit me how much that matured him at an early age. Can any other ISTJ relate?",1607317297

ISTJ,"He brought up how he was tempted not to play D&amp;D with our friend group because of his ""foul mood"" (he was there, but his voice was hoarse, his camera wasn't turned on, and he seemed more distant than usual), and how he was getting in little fights with everyone that day, but when I asked what was going on or if he wanted to talk about it, he said no. 

I guess I'm just confused. Or maybe... concerned I screwed up. My first instinct was to be like ""why would he bring up something if he didn't want to talk about it?"", but then it occurred to me that he WAS talking about it, but by my asking ""do you want to talk about it?"", it made him suddenly self-conscious/like he putting something on me, so he turtled up. I just feel bad, because earlier that day, I word vomited all my anxiety at him without realizing he was...like this.

So today I sent him some memes about depression and the struggles of opening up as a way to sort of...lightheartedly let him know that I get it and he can choose either to open up or not open up and I won't be upset, and he never responded. Which is fine obv, but I'm just worried. About him and about whether or not that was actually condescending or making him feel pressured. I also heard he cancelled a hangout with some other friends today that was supposed to happen.

I know all ISTJ's are different from each other and it's not like you guys can read his mind, but maybe someone on here could shed some insight? Am I...idk...watering my ISTJ right? For reference, I'm an anxious INFP, if you couldn't tell.

TL;DR - ISTJ is acting depressed. Started to open up, but suddenly stopped. Something I did? I sent some memes to show support. No response. He cancelled plans with another group of friends today.

Over the past few weeks it's been a build of missing assignments, dirty clothes piling up and causing my room to be messier, and the stress of procrastination is causing me to go crazy. I don't even know why I do it or what's causing it, maybe depression, I really don't know. 

It's like I get started on something and want to complete it but I ended up telling myself it's not THAT important, so I prioritize less major things instead. They say ISTJ like routine, and I probably have the unhealthiest routine ever. I get up so late, take a hot shower, try to do homework that I half-ass, then just do nothing all day. 

I guess I've tried to discipline myself by doing little things like going to the gym every once in a while, taking a cold shower, but honestly I've noticed that its actually unhealthy doing that. I end up spending hours cleaning and organizing my room than studying for a final exam. I'm in this unhealthy habit of prioritizing things that aren't as important than the other. 

Maybe it's just quarantine, because I'm so accustomed to being lazy now. Even going out and seeing friends has become a chore, I usually don't like leaving my home at all.

 Sometimes I feel like literally anything is possible,like somebody coming to my face and do horrible things to me,that seems plausible to me for a while then I try to readjust to this reality and say to myself it's not possible.

ISTJ,"Hello guys! I‚Äôve had numerous people tell me that I‚Äôm a total ISTJ and they appear to be mostly right but there are also some key traits that I don‚Äôt possess.

I am driven by my responsibilities, honest, keep my word, perfectionist and look stoic outwardly (super emotional on the inside but still). I have a set of principles that I abide by in a rigid manner. I also have two modes that I keep switching between: humorous/funny and serious/angry.

Unfortunately I am also struggle with codependancy towards those I love (I get drawn to ‚Äúdowntrodden‚Äù types, need to be needed and forego myself while tending to their needs). Two of them commented that I act ISFJ in private but ISTJ to the outsiders. I tend to speak very harsly when angered.

I have to have control over myself&amp;immeadiate environment but get furious when someone imposes their authority on me and puts rules in place that I disagree with. I usually end up breaking those rules if I can get away with it or argue over them. If I can‚Äôt afford to openly defy a superior I dislike, I still make sure they know of my feelings towards them with my body language.  Plus I‚Äôve never been someone who obeys things like speeding limits either. Dumb of me, I know but old habits die hard.

So after that long writing, do you think I am an ISTJ, ISFJ or something else entirely? Thank you!

One of our favourite anime is death note both of us enjoyed it and we discussed it together while watching it.

Sometimes I can be dense and it makes her upset when I act that way and she's pretty straightforward and honest which I love because I love hearing and truth and people being honest with me instead of lying to me. And sometimes i get hurt when shes being insensitive but I brush it off. Also, she helps we when  I feel sad and makes me feel better she solves my problem and emotionally supports me.

ISTJ,"My wife is an ISTJ. She fits very well the ISTJ sexual preference descriptions I managed to find: straightforward vanilla at predefined times in easy positions is her favorite. We have had good experiences doing things a little differently too over the almost 20 years we have been together and our vanilla might be unique to us, but I am an INTP... I would love to find different things that work for both of us. I am not sure if we can ever beat our current routine, but I would love to try. 


I have known a long time I am an INTP, but connecting that to sex and comparing to her type is a new thing for me. I think I now understand some things better than talking with her all these years.


I hope you could help me find good ways to talk to her about trying new things. I think any surprises or too drastic changes would likely not work. She also likely needs to be in control and comfortable trying something, so small steps might work best. We are not doing what we did 10 years ago, so there is flexibility in what works for her and also what she prefers. As an INTP I keep wondering if there‚Äôs something else that would work even better. Sometimes I also feel there‚Äôs something lurking under the surface. Either it‚Äôs just my imagination or she actually has something she wouldn‚Äôt mind me discovering.

ISTJ,"Hello,

I am trying to type Melania Trump and since my assumption is that she is an ISTJ, I am watching interviews with her and reading a lot about her, her life, her relationship with Donald Trump etc.

In a number of interviews she talks about how the press is being dishonest and how they've written a lot of lies about her. Particularly in the interview she's given to Anderson Cooper, she talks about her damaged reputation:

&gt;They accused me of doing stuff that I never did in my life and they wrote lies and I will not allow that. I will fight till the end because I don't want they damage my reputation.

My question to you, as you've probably already figured out, is would you do the same if someone damaged your reputation by spreading lies about you? How important is your reputation to you and would you fight till the end to restore it?

For instance in my case, although the theoretical thinking person that I am, sometimes I venture into thoughts of abstracts nature that are so intense that I may often end up doing nothing productive that day.
This would make me feel low at times, but then the unexplainable feelings I get by experiencing/ thinking about such thoughts takes me to another world.

I'm not saying these are all world changing creative ideas or anything because to be fairly honest,  they are mostly just the non-materialistic thoughts I want to have.

I  sometimes rewatch scenes from movies, listen to tracks that actually bring in that gravity to my heart,  howsoever rational person I may seem. For example the abstract theories as they unfold in the fantastic movie Interstellar!  Like how love is part of the extended dimensions and things like that.

Probably doesn't make sense (lol), although I don't know how to.  Even so, it gives me a good feeling when re-watching  to realize how little a heart most of us have and how compassionate we could be. Astounds the bot in me..!

ISTJ,"Hello! I'm an INTJ (though can border with an INFJ - F21) dating an ISTJ (M22) about 4 months now. It's my first healthy relationship I've ever experienced! It's always so great in-person but we can only see each other once a week because of where we live and we both also lead busy lives (juggling work and school), so we connect via texting and Snapchat. I know it doesn't come natural to him, but I feel like (especially when he's busy) he isn't as affectionate with me when we're apart from one another. I feel like he was more conscious about it in the beginning, but now... I don't know. I do know that I have abandonment issues and can be a clingy person, but a random ""I miss you"" text would suffice‚Äîor even an emoji! He says he's terrible at texting, and I get it. He said he would work on it, but it seems like he has a difficult time showing emotion through those texting and using his words. 

He does make an effort to call me every night though for a bit, so maybe that's how he's showing his affection? I guess I'm more of a words and quality time type, and that's difficult for me to get when we don't see each other as often as we would like, and he struggles with words (lol). 

I guess my question to you all is, how do you ISTJs generally show affection? Will it be annoying to you if us NFs and NTs bring it up? What are your experiences? Am I asking for too much here?",1606199644

I was the ""smartest"" kid at elementary school, skated through it without being challenged. I used to study at 1st to 3rd grades but after I realised the persistent success i decided not to study so hard. My work ethic began to slop ever since. I graduated elementary school with somewhat unsatisfactory final marks (finished 8 best out of the whole school), but I was still able to get into a selective/best middle school in town. The school where the ""smart kids"" are supposed to be. At middle school, I barely studied at all, despite not being the smartest kid (I was pretty much in the low average range there). There, the grades were pretty much manipulated (to protect the school's reputation, make sure everybody graduate and have good report cards) And for the average-high average kid it doesn't impact them much, but for me, it did. Grades manipulation means i can never fail, even by putting 0 effort and getting ""low"" scores. This had made me feel complacent. My mum felt like i was a genius. I felt like there's no point in studying anymore. I also don't want to break my mum's expectation for me being a genius by randomly opening a book and giving the impression of not knowing. Everything was fine. I managed to graduate and still have enough score to barely make it into the best highschool in town. The situation is pretty much the same there. Grades Manipulation. My complacency became higher and higher. I don't have anymore drive, i no longer see the point in getting good grades anymore if i can make it to the best anything in town and graduate from it. The last time I studied was at 6th grade (barely studying, just pretending to flip the books so my parents wouldn't notice). I am about to graduate and will soon have to take the college admission test. I looked up last year's version of the test on google and oh my I can't answer a single one of them. I now have this anxiety and habit of not studying combined. I've never studied maths the entire highschool year and now im fucked. I dont even know how to do basic trigonometry and yet i still dont have the drive to study. I am terrible at doing something new. I rarely do anything new. Studying being a new thing for me is the problem. What if I fail the test? Yet again, I can't even begin to study because im not used to it. At this point, all i can do is relinquish my dreams and set a low expectations for myself.

ISTJ,"I am an ISTJ who grew up in a single-parent home as an only child. My mom is an INFP which can be seen in our wildly conflicting views about many, many aspects of life. For example, my mom is an artist who hates her cell phone, and purposefully ignores calls and text messages. I, on the other hand, get massive anxiety if I am unreachable at any given moment and make sure to check and respond to every text message I receive. Despite our differences, it is interesting to see how her creativity and openness to new ideas has influenced my life. 

From reading about the ISTJ type and hearing from other ISTJ's on here, it seems as though ISTJ's struggle with abstract thinking and creativity. For me, I don't find these things to be particularly difficult, most likely because of my upbringing which encouraged free-thinking. On the 16 Personalities description of the ISTJ personality type, I was also surprised to read that ISTJ's prefer traditional family values and gender roles, since I am extremely liberal in my views on both of these topics. I am also a musician, which definitely requires some sort of creativity, but also a good deal of logic when reading complicated sheet music.

Another fascinating part of being a more abstract-thinking ISTJ is that almost all of my friends have the N trait. My best friend, for example, is an INFJ. Although we sometimes disagree on what our priorities are, I love her to death and cannot think of a more reliable and trustworthy friend. I tend to gravitate towards quirkier, creative individuals who are unapologetic with who they are. I even dye my hair purple!

Despite this, I am an ISTJ through and through. I work in retail, and my boss teases me for being so straight-forward with customers and giving no shits when they are unhappy with what I tell them. I am a reliable worker, who follows rules to a T and is determined to have an extraordinary work ethic. This is all a surprise to my INFP mother who was unreliable and rebellious when she was my age.

On a final note, I am currently taking AP Psychology and my teacher had us take the Myers-Briggs test (which I had already done) then put us into groups based on our results. Me and two other introverts were put into a group since we were the only ones with our personality types! I am glad to find a place to discuss what it's like to be an ISTJ since I often struggle to find people who share my values.

What lengths would you go to defend your friends? What kind of advice would you give? Would you approach him first or vice versa when your friendship began?

Female Protagonist  
What's your internal monologue like? What kind of friends do you like? What's your placement in most friend groups(i.e. center of attention, friend of all, etc.)? Are you very nostalgic? Do you perceive lies very well(Please don't overexaggerate your ability)? What kind of thoughts often occur to you? Are you very adventurous?

ISTJ,"So we‚Äôre pretty close friends and have been spending more time together than usual. We went out for a few drinks the other night and he told me that he really loves spending time with me, I said something like ‚Äúaww same‚Äù, which he followed with ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt have to say so if you don‚Äôt actually... this is embarrassing I‚Äôm going to stop‚Äù. 

We got back to his place (still lived with parents) at like 3:20am, and he asked if I wanted to come in, I said ok, he then asked if I wanted to hang out in his room, I went to the bathroom and then he asked if I wanted to stay the night. I said no because wasn‚Äôt sure if his parents ok with it- was pretty surprised too but anyway. 

He also said I was pretty‚Äî but his weird indirect way of saying this was to say I didn‚Äôt need cosmetic surgery... I later confirmed with him it was his weird way of saying he thinks I am pretty.

So, anyway, how do I proceed with this and why is he not just telling me he likes me",1605773156
ISTJ,"So I‚Äôve been a part of the MBTI subreddits for a few months now, and I‚Äôve really enjoyed the memes, bouncing ideas off of y‚Äôall, talking about type, and whatnot. I think you guys will find this interesting.

I‚Äôve started a YouTube channel based around this branch of psychology. One of the main things I‚Äôve been doing on there is breaking down music/lyrics through the lens of type, and you‚Äôd be surprised how much there is to discuss when it comes to the functions (and how they interact) manifesting through songwriting.

If you aren‚Äôt interested, that‚Äôs cool. Obviously there‚Äôs no obligation. I‚Äôm sure it would bore some of you and interest others. People are different.

But I‚Äôm down to break down any songs you request. And if y‚Äôall are down for it, I‚Äôll explore more of that artist‚Äôs music and make more videos on their library.

[Here are all the ones I‚Äôve done so far](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKy9JfrMugrK29I52hYQNcwmoYi79_ePx)

As you can see, there‚Äôs a pretty big emphasis on NF. Most of the people who‚Äôve subscribed so far are heavy NF fans, but I‚Äôll continue branching out to other artists, and like I said, I‚Äôm open for requests.

Love y‚Äôall. Take care.

ISTJ,"Hi guys,

I apologise if this is the wrong place to post this, I need some advice. 

I recently reconnected with an ex-classmate of mine- M,31(ISTJ). He's confessed to being attracted to me F,31(I always get INTP/ENFP on the Myers Briggs- not sure what's going on there) and keeps in contact with me on a daily basis i.e. phone and video calls/texts. We share quite a few hobbies and have a similar sense of humor (goofy, dark, witty). In terms of communication style, I tend to be a little on the verbose side of things :D, and I think it exhausts him, but he keeps coming back for more of my random shit posts and talk and general craziness. 

He has told me that he's become happier ever since we have reconnected, but there are times where he can go for 2-3 days without contacting me. He sends me quite a few mixed signals, for instance, he will flirt with me and then do a 180, and go quiet. He stalks my fb page, and loves finding out information about me but will deny caring about me. He says the meanest things and then laughs at my reaction. He's quite serious, a little cheeky at times, a stickler for rules and can never read between the lines, but I find all of that adorable!

I will be travelling to his hometown in December, and he told me that he would like to meet me, but I'm really not certain if we should meet. I think I have developed some feelings for him and it scares me because judging by the mixed signals he gives me, I have a strong feeling that he'd rather be left alone and might just be keeping in contact with me to get that fwb bonus. He has joked about this a few times. He says that's all he wants from me, then he contradicts himself and will stay up with me when I suffer from insomnia (I work in health) or will distract me when I start overthinking. I was in a bit of a crazy situation recently and he verbalised being worried about me and called me to find out if I am okay and whether he could do anything to help. 

He has told me that he can switch off his emotions when it comes to women and that scares me. He has been cheated on and ditched by his exes. He failed the final year of his electrical engineering degree so he still lives with his parents and manages one of his Dad's stores. He's referred to himself as a ""asshole"" and ""worthless"" before as well. That makes me so upset, because I can see his worth! 

I am not interested in being fwb, because I actually care about him more than that. I am physically attracted to him but more importantly, I am attracted to him emotionally and intellectually. I am against building a relationship(or whatever this thing is!) on the foundation of physical attraction. I really don't mind just being his companion and going on adventures with him! I'm just not sure that he would be interested in that. 

I need your advice on whether I should engage in self preservation and move on, or take the risk, meet him and see where it goes? I have been in a 7 year long bad relationship before and I don't want to invest in something that isn't worth my time. 

Well, that's all of it. If you made it to the end of this, you have survived!!! Thanks for reading!!! :D",1605690664

ISTJ,"Ever since I started working which was like 6 months ago this guy 22M was into me, though I only noticed about 1-2months ago. Since i‚Äôve never been in any relationship i decided to give it a chance, but I wanted to start out as friends before we started dating if we did end up there. Since we work together we see each other all the time, but recently for the past couple of weeks, we hang out outside of work once a week becuz of our schedules. So far everything is going fine, and I do like him but im still in the friend zone cuz I dont feel like ive developed strong feelings for him yet and he knows that and doesnt mind waiting. However, i feel guilty of making him wait cuz he wanted to date since the beginning, and also i feel like ill maybe lead him on if i dont actually develop feelings. At the moment idk how i feel, like I do like him and hes real easy to talk to and we try to hang out when we can, but idk how to get to the next stage? Other ppl i talked to about this say to just let things happen and talk more. Could i just be rushing it too much and should I just give it more time?",1605631304

ISTJ,"I wanted to post this here because I am curious how fellow ISTJ's deal with or have dealt with a longing for a spouse, or significant other.  I understand the idea behind bettering yourself, improving yourself, being able to love yourself, to be alone, have a high level of maturity, etc.  However, if one is doing all of those things, what would really drive the individual to pursue a spouse?  I suppose where I am confused is that some people seemingly have improved their lives with signifiant others, yet am I supposed to not have a desire to also improve the state of my life by focusing on pursuing a spouse?  Should my desire for a spouse not manifest in constantly focusing on it and making it a priority(I tend to overanalyze, haha)?

I am a 22 year old college male, so I understand I have time, I am just curious how all of you ISTJ's out there deal with a longing for a significant other in your life.   I kind of treat it like a check of the box, black and white benchmark, only to be frustrated when I realize that it is more of a greyish venture that cannot be treated as a simple check of the box, if that makes sense.  For example, when I wanted to learn how to shoot and handle a firearm, it was a very step by step process.  Taking that approach to relationships evidently is not a good solution, yet I still find myself very frustrated by my lack of progress. 

 Thanks for any help and advice! I suppose trying to meet and date others is discouraging for many people who wish that phase of their life could be over and done with.",1605494567

ISTJ,"So. I was unlucky enough to be sucked into the ‚Äòhigh potential‚Äô programme at work a few weeks ago, and this involved undergoing a few different ‚ÄòHR assessments‚Äô.

How bad could it be- I had thought to myself. The assessments had two parts, one was a psychometric test to establish preferences and one was the standard IQ style test.

I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôve ever read Gifts Differing, but there‚Äôs a section where it says that sensors generally perform worse on IQ tests because they are reading the questions so many times. This is me.

It‚Äôs a horrendous ordeal going through these questions and my poor brain is trying to translate all this stuff to real things so I can work through all the possibilities, and lo and behold I‚Äôve run out the time before I even get half way through.

Fast forward a few weeks and despite all rational logic I apparently did well on the aptitude test, and what I really should have been worrying about was the character assassination I was going to receive for the psychometric testing.

The nub of this whole thing seems to be:

- It would be better if I preferred abstract thinking
- it would be better if I preferred influencing people
- it would be better if I were more emotionally available to people

In fairness, the HR person didn‚Äôt come out and say my preferences were wrong, but gave me a distinct impression that other preferences would be better. Go figure.

The whole thing kind of riled me up to be honest. Luckily I had gotten too busy I wasn‚Äôt able to follow up on any of this stuff, but I had been preparing to fall on my sword for the sake of my sensor brethren.

Part of me feels like it‚Äôs nobody‚Äôs business what my preferences are (or really anything that‚Äôs inside my head), and really it‚Äôs what I do and people see me doing that matters, but I fear there‚Äôs going to come a point where I‚Äôm going to have suck up all this stuff and play the game, where the game is apparently behaving less like a sensor.

What do you do in these situations? Try not to be noticed? Fight the system? Play the game?",1605393962

However, if someone who can't do what they're supposed to do be honest with me and apologizes, I might forgive them or help them. i.e) ""Hey I'm very sorry, I have a job interview, I just had breakfast and I won't have time to do it, can I do it when I come back from it?"" &lt;- something like this, I'd be cool ""hey go kill it, don't worry about it"" but if someone is being a jerk because they can be?

ISTJ,"Yeah. A slight bit of no surprise that an ENFP is asking this question. This is an issue I've been thinking on for a long time, and honestly at this point, I am ready for some insight. Looked through this subreddit for a decent time now and haven't been satisfied for an answer, so I am here. Take me gently.¬†

*TL;DR: As someone who doesn't relate the strongest with an ISTJ, how do I avoid small talk and invest in our relationship and truly engage/connect with them, whether in conversation or otherwise?*

This is a long spiel. If you want to understand the situation and my position/where I am at in it best, I would read everything below.

**Rundown of the Situation:**¬†Essentially, I have a friend that is an ISTJ. We both seem to value our friendship and had wanted to invest in it, at least from what I can inference. I believe they value the friendship because they would actively go to be in my company (whether that's out of secure routine, I don't know),¬†always seemed to offer me help in things they feel they can, and makes visible efforts to interact with me in general.¬†

However, nearly 85% of the time we chat or talk, we stutter and default to small talk. I believe we both see that we relate to each other in many ways and are eager to engage with one another; though only to stumble through interactions. It really is a comedic situation in my eyes, like two people really pumped to high five each other but limply failing. At the end of the day, it's just exhausting, taxing, and disheartening. Conversations always seem to hold stress and strain.

The times I've felt we've engaged each other is when we explore the depths of their interest or expertise together, or when we're joking about each other and our respective eccentricities.¬†

I think it is also worth mentioning in this rundown that we're both just young adults, typically not the most mature people. 

I value the friendship and worry that they will end up feeling indifferent about our relationship and, at worst, slowly faze out. I know ISTJs are known over and over for their loyalty, but this is a worry of mine. We always joke about them being a hermit, and I recall making an off joke this one time with this worry underlying the joke. Went something along the lines of ""Man, the minute you're done university, I am probably never gonna see or talk to you again, you're going straight up off-grid"" and they sharply turned to me with an expression as if I said something that offended or greatly hurt them, and I quickly tried to smooth things over by saying ""But knowing myself, I'll probably find some way to harass you. No escaping that easy"". They smiled and chuckled at this and we continued. This was a while ago, and I can only surmise they must have felt offended because they really went out of their way to invest in the friendship and I just discounted it completely with that off joke and communicated no recognition of their investment. 

**My Thoughts/Position:** I believe our dreaded small talk and stuttering is a result of the wide disparity between our personalities and our lack of development and balancing as people. Just not on the same frequency.¬†¬†

I understand that ISTJ's go the slow and sweet path and they take their time to grow a relationship. I subdue the ENFP's fateful need to violate and tear into the most inner depths of someone's emotional anals, yet am I just so impatient to feel that good progress isn't being made by these strained small talk sessions? I think it's unlikely that they take much from the small talk either. I feel disheartened because I feel I can't properly express how much I do value the time spent with them and express properly myself as a person. I want to express myself within their personal limits and boundaries, but I really don't know how to really engage with them within these limits, and default to small talk.  

I've read that ISTJs enjoy talking about their interests, expertise, or solving an issue. I've prompted them by asking about one of their particular interest/expertise as they really only seem to have one they're heavily invested in. It doesn't really get us far in conversation and often is just more fodder in our small talk. I can only guess I don't know how to properly grow and support conversation on the topic of their interest. I try to pique interest in myself about the topic by asking questions to them, but this too falls flat. I know I am not developed enough as a person to abandon how I personally and naturally like to interact with people fully and thus can't engage them fully and selflessly, but that's the point of any relationship, to grow alongside each other. This growing process isn't going to have breakneck speed, but I would appreciate any thoughts on keeping in mind. 

As I said, I've been thinking about this on and off for a while, and any input would help and direct that process along a lot. I am just done with the small talk.  Any insight or thoughts are appreciated, this is just a circus fire of a situation circling in my head.¬†",1604791219
ISTJ,"This is after reading a lot of threads about the things about feelers that annoy/baffle thinkers (as an INFP I‚Äôm trying to gain perspective and grow). 

One of the biggest themes I see mentioned is that thinkers find feelers inconsolable and prone to wallowing, venting and feeling bad rather than simply fixing the problem.

Now as a feeler myself I find this interesting because I see myself in that description a lot, in terms of what I do PRIVATELY (and on Reddit of course), but I almost never wallow or vent about my feelings or depressive spirals (at least I don‚Äôt think I do) to other people because I know how annoying it is to listen to (I truthfully don‚Äôt love being on the receiving end) and I know how that comes across. However, I‚Äôm wondering if my definition of venting/complaining/wallowing is different than yours? 

For instance, I easily get embarrassed and anxious. I‚Äôm medicated and working on my anxiety with a therapist but really I‚Äôve just accepted it as part of my life. I blush, have trouble maintaining eye contact, talk too fast and stumble over my words sometimes when I get really nervous or embarrassed. I don‚Äôt really try to hide it because to me it‚Äôs not really a dark emotion it‚Äôs just part of everyday life. But it can get a little excessive. Sometimes I‚Äôll tell people, with a smile, that I‚Äôm a bit nervous or flustered or embarrassed so I apologize if I didn‚Äôt make much sense. I‚Äôm trying to do this less often, but does that count as complaining or wallowing? I never thought of it that way because it‚Äôs not necessarily a bad thing to me to get nervous, but others might think it is? To be honest I enjoy being a bit jittery! 

Sometimes to my friends I mention I‚Äôm slightly envious but not in a bad way, just in a way that motivates me to compete with them or the person I‚Äôm talking about (nicely). To me I‚Äôm giving them a compliment but it may come across as wallowing. 

Sometimes I do freak out a bit and have little ‚Äúanxiety spirals‚Äù where I start panicking and worrying that I‚Äôve done something bad or embarrassing or hurt someone‚Äôs feelings. In this instance I can be pretty unreasonable and annoying because I really make a big deal out of something small though it seems huge to me. I‚Äôm seeking relief from the anxiety when I do this as well as an objective opinion and reassurance (if sincere). This is probably the closest to wallowing though my friends have described it as panicking. Usually I do this without realizing because my anxiety is so high and has been since I can remember that I don‚Äôt even know it‚Äôs not normal. I‚Äôm trying to cut this out, because I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs annoying as hell, but is this the same to you as venting? 

Thank you very much for your insight! 

Love,
an INFP",1604789441
ISTJ,"Hello ISTJs,

This is my first post on Reddit and it's a pretty long one. I'm looking for advice and I'm not sure whom to turn to. I hope you guys get to the bottom of it and help me understand my ISTJ better.

I'm an INFP (F)  dating a ISTJ guy for about 1 and half years and I'm on verge of breaking up with him. Talking to him isn't helping so I thought I'd ask you guys for some insight.

 A little background about him: he's a 29year guy who is insanely smart and disciplined. He's very successful in his career and graduated from one of the top business schools in my country and was a gold medalist in his batch. He's heavily into fitness and runs about 15kms everyday. Has a schedule for everything and is extremely frugal. His hobbies include reading philosophy books, learning about investments and enjoys playing chess and loves traveling. Apart from me, he dated one girl for about 3 months in his early twenties. Says he hasn't been through any trauma, has a stable family and career, and doesn't need any kind of support from anyone. Values his alone time to pursue his hobbies. It's very difficult to impress him and he's generally disappointed with people around him. He maintains an excel sheet for everything he does. For example: books he reads, kilometres he runs, push ups, sexual activity and also maintains a balance sheet of his finances. Keeps a tab on what he does for others and makes sure they return the favor too. 

About me: I'm a 28 year old writer. I work in an ad agency and I'm moving to a different country to do my masters in the next couple of months. I enjoy cooking, spending time with pets, watching movies/series and arts and craft. I'm a very sensitive person and it's easy to hurt my feelings. I have a very complicated family history. My dad left us when I was 3 years old and later we found out that he had a family before us that he abandoned too. He left our family and married again and had 3 kids. After a few years he left them too. My mum 's an orphan who grew up in a convent. However she managed to get ahead in life and became an asian gold medalist in a sport. After dad left, she left me and my sister in a hostel when I was 5. She developed severe anxiety, depression and OCD. She turned abusive and would beat me and my sister up and emotionally abuse us. She'd wouldn't pay our school or hostel fee or pick us up during holidays. Needless to say it's been really hard on me and my sister. I'm relatively better off because I started working after college and became independent. Don't think I have mental illness but I'm prone to feel emotions strongly. However, my sister is 31 and has never worked. She has anxiety and depression and is showing signs of OCD.


Coming back to our relationship, we met on Tinder and from the very first date he seemed smitten. I wasn't so sure of him because he hardly spoke and had these puppy eyes thing going that made him seem adorable. He told me he was looking for a long term relationship and I was looking for the same thing too. I admired his discipline and how grounded he was. We seemed like a good fit for awhile. Things took a turn when the lockdown began in March. He stays with his family so we live apart. I lived with a flatmate. During the 2months of lockdown, he'd barely text or call. Those two months I didn't have work. Also I couldn't step out and meet friends which made things worse for me. When I was upset and I'd call him to talk about it he'd get frustrated with me. He'd get angry that little things had the power to shake my peace of mind. This really hurt me because I was going through a dark time and I was looking for emotional support. We hardly ever fight but when we do, his rage comes out in bursts and then he shuts himself off for days. I can't stand the silent treatment so I try my best to keep things calm and ignore signs of trouble. Our sex life slowly came to a halt and I didn't feel like initiating anymore. It's no longer enjoyable and when I told him what I liked in bed, he would go quiet. after the lockdown, he began visiting alternate days and we'd work from home and then he'd go back to his family. When I wanted to do something together with him like cook or watch a movie, he shows no interest. I thought he was serious about me because he introduced me to his family (it's a big deal in my country) and his friends. He wanted to me start working out and sleep on time. I used to do that before the lockdown but after it began, this has gone for a toss. He'd nag that I'm not working out, eating healthy or sleeping on time everyday. I'm at a healthy weight (119 pounds and 5.4 feet tall) as much as I want to work out, I don't enjoy doing it at home. I go for about 5km walks everyday but he's not happy with that. Recently he messaged me saying that he has seen only the worst side of me and he's yet to see the best. That really hurt. When asked him to explain further, he said I don't live up to his physical fitness standards and he's disappointed in me. He feels he's giving more in the relationship and not getting anything. When asked him what he wants from me, he said he doesn't want anything but just wants me workout everyday  He also said he didn't find anything admirable about me. Hearing him say that was a blow to my self esteem. The past couple of years my self confidence has been slowly picking up and now it feels shattered. I replied saying I've been through a lot and I'm still standing on my feet and I'm trying to be better by doing my masters and getting a better job abroad. 

The next day he suprised me and just showed up at my door. He said he was sorry and that he loved me. I was so hurt so I didn't say anything or reciprocate. We didn't talk about the fight but he tried be nice by trying to take me out for dinner and planning a trip the next week. I didn't agree to either.

Considering there are too many red flags in every aspect of our relationship, I've been thinking of breaking up with him. I find it very difficult to accept his standards for myself. I'm sorry for sounding whiny, it's been a rough couple of days. I prefer to let people do their own thing so when someone is trying to force something on me, I don't understand it.

How do you stop habits which are unhealthy and may seem like an obsession at some point. For instance, overworking yourself until burnout, restarting everything from scratch when there's a mistake, or online stalking addiction (I've read a post here that this is common for ISTJs, although I don't know exactly why).",1604468787

ISTJ,"I'm so freaking tired of the ISTJ stereotypes. Usually ISTJ are described as boring, robotic, emotionless. You sure know the deal. And don't get me started with the memes. I'm sure most of them aren't even created by ISTJs themselves and thus they are portrayed as the most plain people in the entire universe. I'm done.

I have been in a relationship with a ISTJ for four years now and I hope for many years to come. He is the most dedicated, down-to-earth and loving person I ever encountered in my entire life. I am myself an INFP. I usually read about the incompatibility of ISTJ and INFP pairing, and I guess it can be true to some people, but I wouldn't trade my ISTJ for the world. Maybe I don't know much about the MBTI but we share functions, right? I can lean on my Si, he can lean on his Fi, for instance. We can come as very different, but it's a balanced relationship. I'm the stormy sea, he is the lighthouse on land.

I am going to be talking about the ISTJs I know, specially my SO, as he's the one that I know the most. ISTJs can be extremely funny and witty. They can come up with the punniest puns ever with a straight face and the whole room will crack of laughter. Almost like awfully bad dad jokes that are actually really funny.

They are emotionless robots, they say. Well, somebody that might think that have never been close to an ISTJ or can't pass through the fa√ßade. Because ISTJs feel, like everybody else, but only the closest people for them can access the emotional expression. They suffer, they love, they cry. You just have to take the time to look throught their serene presence and get to know them.

ISTJs are, as their own name say, loyal. The Loyal Logistician. Once you are in, you are in. To the point that they can get trapped with some that might try to take advantage of this. They might not express their support for you, but they go extra-miles to demostrate you this through actions. I, as an INFP, can come up with a constant flow of ideas and my bf ISTJ will support me in each and every one of them.

The rule-obsessed thing. Oh, geez. Sure, ISTJs have strict personal morals and principles. But, there's the key! ""Personal"". They don't just follow unconsciously everything that an authority figure commands. Throught experience, they adquire some personal rules and they do work with those. That doesn't mean every one that is a ISTJ has the same principles or rules.

ISTJ is considered as the most common type in the MBTI. Some people mock them for that. But I wish there were more healthy ISTJs out there. Because they are one of the most wonderful people I know. They are needed, they move the world and they devoted to make life better for their loved ones.

Thanks for reading this far. Leave a comment about what you think about your own experience or your experience with ISTJs, if you want.

ISTJ,"I live with my SO and while we do spend a lot of time together, I find that as as an introvert I still require a lot of alone time even though we are physically occupying the same space. We have some hobbies that we enjoy together (like board games) but I also tend to do a lot of crafts and watch certain TV shows on my own. We often spend time doing our own thing in separate areas of the house unless we are making meals together, hanging out with friends, or occasionally enjoying a hobby together. Even though I love my SO I still very much enjoy having time to myself. How do other ISTJs spend their time at home as a couple? I also don't currently have kids - does this change when you become a parent?",1604287032

I did the MBTI test when I was in my first years in university, I found out that I'm an ISTJ, 6 years passed now I'm a medical doctor graduate so I thought maybe my personality changed after all these years but nope, turns out I'm an ISTJ-Assertive which I think after reading about it a bit it describes how I became after maturing and becoming an adult with full responsibilities.

However I would like more information about it, can anyone guide me?

ISTJ,"I want to start by saying that I know that nobody fits into any type perfectly and ISTJs are more than their stereotype, but a lot of things about myself and the way I‚Äôve seen ISTJs act doesn‚Äôt match up with me even though it‚Äôs the type I relate with most, I have most stereotypical weaknesses, I can be very bossy with siblings and family, i‚Äôm extremely self critical and perfectionistic, somewhat critical of others close to me  though I don‚Äôt usually share my criticisms. I‚Äôm also  quite nostalgic and  don‚Äôt get super bored very often, as well as very concerned with fitting in and just being normal. Some of my dreams are traditional, for example I want to get married one day. I can be quite judgy and put people into groups as well which I hate about myself and am trying to change. My friends compare me to ISTX characters most often. A part of me feels that the reason i think ISTJ matches me is due to  my astrological chart basically describing the typical istj, but this doesn‚Äôt seem very ISTJ at all especially considering astrology has no evidence to back it I just blindly believe it. It‚Äôs just that no other type fits me function-wise and description wise and I just feel like I know I‚Äôm an ISTJ, and I want to clarify that none of my immature behaviours are representative of ISTJs. I‚Äôm still growing and trying to be a better person. 

Firstly I‚Äôm very disorganised, I never know when deadlines are, when things are due, how to organise my environment and my work etc. All of the little things I have to do build up and become extremely overwhelming and frustrating for me. I can‚Äôt remember dates or numbers for the life of me leading my friends to constantly tease me about just how disorganised I am, and I always leave things to the last minute or don‚Äôt do them at all. In typical ISTJ fashion I like to make lists as I feel my thoughts are flying away and that ties them down, but i‚Äôve never been able to cross a single item off of them. Overly structured people frustrate me, as well as people who centre their lives around work or school.

I‚Äôve also been called scatterbrained all throughout my life, I find it hard to focus on daily tasks and give them my full attention or any at all. I‚Äôm usually too busy daydreaming about my unrealistic future dream life, or going back in time to ancient greece and changing the course of the future etc. This also leads to me being very very clumsy due to always being in my head I have countless stories of my embarrassing clumsiness in public causing me problems, I do have a very difficult time focusing on the present, so I find sports especially hard and usually get hit by a ball or something because i‚Äôm not paying attention and my hand eye coordination is below average.  I can go a long time without noticing changes in my environment but the other day i did notice a sign on my way home had changed straight away, so maybe i‚Äôm improving in this department. My daydreamed future seems like it‚Äôs actually going to happen to me, and it becomes a goal. 
In terms of memory I can remember things people told me a very long time ago and they‚Äôd be shocked that I remember. But my memories are usually in third person and not very detailed, I mainly remember the feeling or vibe of a memory more than the actual memory. I also can‚Äôt notice  subtle flavours like most ISTJ‚Äôs, I usually like food to be very strongly flavoured in order to feel like I can actually taste it. But i do eat things I like over and over again, not days in a row but quite often until i get sick of it and never want it again, same with songs.  I‚Äôm also terrible at all stem subjects but have always been very good at humanities and literature naturally and am a big fan of fantasy romance and theory and hater of sci-fi, I know this doesn‚Äôt matter too much as people of all types can have different interests. Not sure if this is relevant but I do also change my hopes and dreams every few months and I‚Äôm overall very indecisive.
 
I‚Äôm quite headstrong and stubborn and if someone tells me to do something a different way I will usually do it my way and not listen to them. But my opinions are relatively easy to change because of how easily influenced I am, I almost absorb them from my environment, which seems quite ISTJ. If someone tells me they don‚Äôt like a film I begin to not like that film etcetera even if I try to stop it.  I‚Äôm very sensitive to criticism and a single mistake will often leave me thinking that I‚Äôm just innately not good at something and it was meant to be that way. As much as I hate to admit it I don‚Äôt think i‚Äôm willing to work for things.  I absolutely hate authority and the way society just is, but still want to impress authority figures. I find change and travel exciting, and meeting new people excites me despite how terribly awkward I am, but I‚Äôm not a risk taker and I get sentimental so don‚Äôt like things attached to my childhood changing.  I mainly enjoy small changes like changing the way I prepare a recipe or load the washing machine to find more fun and effective ways of doing it, but I think big changes like packing up and moving to a new country would be very exciting and I often dream about doing stuff like that if i had money.  When it comes to following instructions I usually can‚Äôt follow them to a T because it‚Äôs tedious and I tend not to care if others don‚Äôt do things by the book, this doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt like instructions though as if faced with a completely new task I‚Äôll look up instructions on how to complete it after fiddling around with it myself for a bit. However if I‚Äôm asked to do a household task I‚Äôll usually need the person to be very specific in what they want me to do and how, this doesn‚Äôt really apply to other tasks though. 

I‚Äôve been told by others that I smile too much, and I am a social chameleon and a people-pleaser, the opinions of others even strangers mean a lot to me and I often won‚Äôt be honest if it will hurt someone‚Äôs feelings unlike most ISTJs, in fact I‚Äôm very agreeable in social situations and just agree with what everyone else says even if i don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs true. Unlike most ISTJs I can tell my loved ones that I love them and can be extremely chatty and talk way too much, I especially did this as a child. I doubt i‚Äôm an Fe user highly though, As i usually know my own feelings and like to work through them and understand why I felt them and get very heated and passionate about political issues IF they effect me personally, and can sometimes be pretty selfish. I will be an ally to other causes, but I won‚Äôt feel the same rage as I do if the issue effects me personally. My sense of humour is random and sarcastic which seems quite ISTJ. 

If i want to believe something desperately I‚Äôll often stay in denial if new information proves that thing to be false and just ignore the information. But sometimes new information leads me to change my view completely. I‚Äôm also very judgemental of people with different political views than me, so just anyone who‚Äôs right wing can anger me. 

I like to argue and debate with those very close to me which seems ISTJ, also the fact that my friend said it‚Äôs quite hard to get to know me. I do feel like no one truly knows me though, because I just try to live up to the expectations I think they have of me and I‚Äôm very lost when it comes to my identity and knowing who I am and have issues with insecurity. I would like to mention though that I don‚Äôt like debates with people i‚Äôm not comfortable with, usually I pussy out or just let them win the argument. 

I don‚Äôt really care about following rules or give the rules any importance and think about half are completely pointless, still I follow them usually because I‚Äôm worried about what will happen if I don‚Äôt. 

I don‚Äôt consider feeling types or intuitive types much as I don‚Äôt get gut feelings or predictions, nor do I have millions of ideas and experience deja vu at all. I have lightbulb moments as the average person does, but I don‚Äôt feel as though I see patterns everywhere or am a creative genius. Poetry and song lyrics don‚Äôt usually mean much to me and I mainly listen to music for the beat. But i do cry very easily at movies and in general, I seem to not be able to hold my feelings in and believe in things istjs might consider silly like fate, or that everything will turn out ok. I also catastrophise when a member of my family comes home late which is a sign of inferior Ne as far as I‚Äôm aware, weirdly though I 100% relate to everything associated with inferior Se and not much with inferior Ne. Like if i‚Äôm trying to focus and i hear the slightest little sounds i get quite frustrated and am completely incapable of living in the present moment, but this seems like it could be an Si thing too. 

When it comes to Si i don‚Äôt think about my past much consciously, unless I‚Äôm reminiscing on my childhood and romanticising it rather than remembering how it was in actuality. When nostalgic I do like to watch movies and listen to songs from my childhood however and find it quite comforting. eventhough a lot of me doesn‚Äôt fit Si and I don‚Äôt really relate to it, I relate to it more than all of the other dominant functions. 

Also i‚Äôm not sure if i made it clear that i was introverted, that‚Äôs the only thing i‚Äôm sure of. I get very drained by being around people for long periods of time and need a lot of time to myself, speaking of being sure of stuff i‚Äôm never sure of anything. Is that a personality related thing? idk

Sorry that this was so robotic annoying and weirdly structured, I felt like I was listing off aspects of my personality and even this is scratching the surface. It‚Äôs quite frustrating getting into MBTI and not knowing what type you are especially considering I‚Äôm a person who needs closure, and there‚Äôs a lot of misleading stereotypes out there. I know there are messy and disorganised ISTJs, and some descriptions of the ISTJ got to me, describing us as boring common corporate drones etcetera. I know these stem from intuitive bias but they still hurt my feelings. I wonder if the people writing these know that so many of the people they look up to in their lives are probably ISTJ. 
Any help would be appreciated! :)",1604079801

There is this ISTJ, (a friend) that I'm really interested. 
She's 5 years younger and I'm teaching her basics about entrepreneurship making her somewhat my secretary. We were doing great at first. She enjoys the task I give her and help her plan meetings for my appointments. She helps me out on her own way and tells me not to stress myself too much. She even took a photo of me once when we were eating together (not really sure what that means).
After a short while, I mentioned to her that I like her. That's where things went spiraling down. 
She started to get annoyed at me about everything I do, mildly snide remarks are becoming frequent. One time that we got a chance to talk privately, she mentioned that she doesn't like me. We are still in touch and a bit of a good terms with each other since I am still teaching her what I promised and she enjoys it.

Her rejection makes me want to pursue her more.

Questions:

2. I'd like some insight about her taking my photo. I'm really confused on why she took it then tells me that she's not interested in me.
3. If I can't make her interested in me, what should I do to ease up the tension and make things the way it is before I confessed? (I'm planning to take the slow route and try to pursue her again after)
4. I really like spoiling her. Given that I'm older, should I be more strict on her and scold her when she throws remarks at me?

T, thanks for being a true friend. I enjoy how blunt and no-nonsense we can be. There are never any miscommunications between us, even when we‚Äôre struggling a bit with our FP friends lol. You are intelligent and hard working, but please know that you don‚Äôt always need to send your homework to people who wouldn‚Äôt do the same! Thank you for always listening to my theories and educational rants. My favorite part is when you flat out say I have something wrong with me, just because I‚Äôm a little too excited to take tests lol. Sometimes it confuses me how you can‚Äôt keep up with our chaotic teacher. Then, I realize that anyone who‚Äôs observant wouldn‚Äôt know the first thing about the complex eccentricity of our teacher. You need figure out what she‚Äôs going to want from us, not what she‚Äôs doing in the moment haha. It makes me laugh when you ask how I know about what‚Äôs going to happen, but it‚Äôs even better when you fill me in on what actually happened when I was aloof and ‚Äúfiguring it out.‚Äù If there‚Äôs anyone who can laugh at my blunt sarcasm, it‚Äôs you. I love how it blows your mind when I say what we‚Äôre both thinking (and bonus points if it‚Äôs during the exact moment we‚Äôre thinking it). Between our confusing friends and even more confusing history class, I‚Äôm so glad I have a smart friend by my side. Junior year of high school is crazy enough, but we‚Äôre in it together. Thanks for being loyal and taking friendship as seriously as I do. -J",1603759410
ISTJ,"""Crisis"" is sort of a strong word - I mean more like a situation that is just annoying enough to be frustrating and inconvenient. 

For example, earlier today my ESTJ significant other and I were trying to make a pizza in the oven and it ended up falling through the oven rack and making a complete mess. I smelled food burning at the bottom of the oven so I went to go deal with it. I find myself very calm and rational in situations like this. I figure ""well - there is something bad happening and there's no way to change what happened at this point so I might as well deal with it in this moment in the best way that I know how to do"" (ie. turning off the oven, getting the pizza out, throwing it away, and figuring out something else quick to eat). My SO on the other hand tends to get much more visibly frustrated and starts to jump to the worst possible conclusions (ie. says things like ""this is a disaster"", ""how are we going to clean all this up??"", ""great now we have nothing to eat"" in a very upset tone). I guess I just find no point in dwelling on the bad details and would rather just remedy the situation as quickly and calmly as possible without causing a big scene.

I know this is a super specific example but I've noticed similar patterns during other ""minor crisis"" type situations between me and my SO. Do other ISTJs handle unexpected situations in a similar way to me?",1603682255

ISTJ,"I know the test instructions says to trust your first instincts but I couldn't do that, I would hate the idea that a few question with multiple potential answers would make me end up with the ""wrong"" personality. I needed to weigh all my options, create real life scenarios and that fit the question and my behaviour in general, and choose the best answer on the spectrum. I think this is related to ISTJs being more prone to OCD than other personalities.

Then I saw Ben Shapiro doing the test and he went through it in like 3 minutes, while basically ignoring the spectrum which made me very uncomfortable lol

ISTJ,"Vito Corleone MBTI ISTJ - The Godfather MBTI

  
Vito Corleone ISTJ - The Godfather Myers-Briggs Types

  
Me and my brother did a trade and he told me on to watch the Godfather Trilogy, so here I am about to finish the first film masterpiece again. I felt its time to do a post on the Don Vito Corleone so here goes, enjoy the post.

  
Vito Corleone is a ISTJ and a Si dom, am I'm gonna tell you why. Vito is obsessed security and cares about tradition, rules, and the old way of doing things. He cares a lot about security and hates taking risks at all costs, the entire film of the Godfather, his Si security always comes out in the film and with his traditions and values he believes. He cares about being a man alot and has different traditions and rules he follows and abides by based on it. ""Good, a man who doesn't make time for his family isn't a real man."" Si and Fi coming out in him here. He doesn't believe in narcotics for him or as a mafia boss, he thinks its too risky and dangerous and just causes problems for everyone investing them and using them. Vito's Si does not want to take the risk and fears the negative possibilities that will come if he takes them on in his life, Ne inferior as a ISTJ in him here. He says in a boss mafia meeting later in the film, I'm a superstitious man, classic ISTJ line, what if my son Mike gets shot by the police? Or hangs himself? Or gets struck by lightning? These are all Ne inferior lines with him fearing negative possibilities as a classic ISTJ and Si dom and Ne inferior user which he struggles with clearly and hates. He says I give my word on my grandchildrens souls that I will keep the peace as I say in this meeting, Si promise and Fi inner values in him coming out here and abiding by them. He tells Mikey I'm sorry I fall back on old habits, Si dom again coming out in Vito, I try to not be careless, he says I'm sorry its a habit with him focusing so much on the thing he said to him in their talk, women and children can be careless but not me, Si dom tradition beliefs he believes in as a ISTJ and Fi inner values too tertiary coming out in him as a ISTJ as well. The Don cares about efficiency and gives people orders and is bossy and assertive, he's very logical and cold and is a very calm person and collected too and is very level headed as well. He's described as a humble man and a man of his word, classic Si dom behaviors and ISTJs stereotypes. He says I don't believe in using narcotics, not back then and still now, he sticks to his word and beliefs and is very old school with his thinking the whole film and everyone knows its, the mafia bossess know this in him his old school beliefs and style of doing things and they want him to change they say which he doesn't and Mikey even explains in his talk to his girl his father is old school and he knows this very well about him. The Don Vito Corleone is a classic ISTJ and Si dom and I hope this short post on his why and analysis helped explain why. The Godfather is one of the greatest films of all time and greatest mafia crime action movies too and I don't need to explain that obvious fact to anyone here. So I felt Vito Corleone should be done justice so here it is, to clear up why he's a clear ISTJ to me in my opinion. Hope you enjoyed the post and tell me your thoughts and what you think down below.

  
Here's a post by fictionalcharactermbti with Don Vito Corleone listed as ISTJ as well, I agree with the other typings here as like Mike INTJ and Sonny ESTP and so on too, I'll do a Mike INTJ post next soon as well so look out for that:

I'm not always annoyed, but I am a lot, and I wonder if it's a ""me"" thing or a general ISTJ thing.

ISTJ,"Do you guys daydream? Like have active, creative daydreams? My ESTJ wife just asked me and I can honestly say that, in my adult life, I have not. 


Whereas she is constantly playing out different fantasies and scenarios, my mind is focused on present situations and potential problems that might need solving. Would that be considered a *daydream*?",1603423630
ISTJ,"Stereotypicals ISTJ's are described as ""Boring"", very workaholic and traditional-like.

So the title says it all. The way I relate to being an ISTJ is that I have strong use of Si with the fact that I am in touch with my inner sensations and gut feelings (Such as Nostalgia, Euphoria, Sensory stuff that bring me pleasure and comfort).

To be honest, I dont consider myself as a workaholic, as I quite prone to be lazy at times and tend to give up on myself from time to time, as focusing on myself takes effort. Usualy when I try to do stuff to work, it is usualy focus on the self, such as excersize and stuff which allows me to get better and desireable results of myself, my body and my mind.

I have been discussing this on an MBTI discord server, many has explained that I probably have strong use of Se in Socionics, which is why as an ISTJ it makes it seems like I have Se.

I'd consider myself a very moody person, in a sense that I am very prone to temper-tantrums and anger, I can get incredibly stubborn, 'close-minded' (Usualy pointed out by others) and I'm prone to hold grudges (Sometimes in a ways that I lust for revenge, which is very unhealthy). Initialy ISTJ are Enneagram 6w5 or 1w9 core typicaly, but in my case my enneagram core type is 8w7 sx/so. I unconsciously tend to become controling and forceful, when things dont go as I desire it.

Many has criticised me for my temper-tantrum behaviour, and thus people has confused me for a Fi dom because of the Fi dom stereotypes like being whiny and ""crying"".

And for an ISTJ, I suprisingly love being adventurious. I love stuff that allows me to challenge myself, things that push me out of the comfort zone.

Thus my favorite hobbies usualy consist of activities that allow me to be adventurious, to explore and try out new stuff, and things that allow me to stimulate my creative freedom.

This is so far information about myself, I wonder to know if there are any other ISTJ's out there relate to this so far?",1603417105

What are the chances he‚Äôll say yes after telling me often that it won‚Äôt work with us? How much time will it take him to get back to me if by chance he isn‚Äôt ignoring my question?

ISTJ,"I‚Äôm looking for help finding my type! I am pretty new to the MBTI world but I have taken quite a few tests and have gotten both INTJ and ISTJ multiple times. Both descriptions also feel like they are very ‚Äòme‚Äô so I‚Äôm confused. I know this is pretty long but I would appreciate any responses! (I posted on the TypeMe page too but didn‚Äôt get a definite response). Here are some things that others have pointed out as ‚Äòtelling‚Äô of my type. 

The part of ISTJ I feel most strongly about is the ‚Äòliking familiarity‚Äô aspect. I like structure in my life and I don‚Äôt really like doing or trying things that are new. However, I‚Äôm not good at making this structure for myself and usually work in bursts of hyperfixation. I was told that desiring safety and stability is more ISTJ. However, when it comes to different forms of knowledge, I don‚Äôt have a problem going outside my ‚Äòcomfort zone‚Äô (I wouldn‚Äôt even say I have a comfort zone for learning or subjects to take classes in). I am a geography major at university who has changed their major 5 times and I have taken courses in nearly every department. I love learning for its own sake and love being able to use all of the things I‚Äôve studied in conjunction, since I see connections between different subjects. I definitely relate to the INTJ aspect of scientific or skeptical approach to reality. I‚Äôm pretty curious and I like to know how things work. It makes me uncomfortable when I don‚Äôt understand something and I will typically investigate super specific things or subjects and then keep that random knowledge forever once I‚Äôve figured something out. I always approach situations with 100% logic which is why I‚Äôve been described as ‚Äúanalytical‚Äù and even ‚Äúrobotic‚Äù before. 

In terms of helping other, if someone asks for my opinion on something I don‚Äôt know about/have experience with, I will most likely tell them I don‚Äôt want to answer and then if they really press me, I would basically¬†compare their problem to things I‚Äôve seen before¬†and then offer a recommendation based on that. However, if it is something I do know about, I will interact with the conversation more and I do enjoy teaching other people about some niche thing I know about because I love to share the knowledge I‚Äôve accumulated over the years. 

I don‚Äôt feel comfortable in situations that are purely social because I don‚Äôt feel like I have anything to contribute to conversations like that. When friends start talking about other people, relationships, gossip, etc. I check out since I don‚Äôt find conversations on those topics to be productive or really offer me anything (essentially, what is the point in talking about that stuff? lol). I would much rather discuss something tangible that can have conclusions, opinions based on facts, and some type of logic applied to it. Since I don‚Äôt talk much in social situations people always say I‚Äôm quiet, mysterious, or they think I dislike them, but in fact, they just aren‚Äôt talking about something I want to discuss and it‚Äôs not personal. I tend to be good at arguing and debating people since I see conversations as having a clear spatial structure with connections and pieces and I can, therefore, see flaws in their arguments easily and point out when things said are fallacious, etc. 

I was told that INTJs tend to expect the same level of investment from others that they might put into a task or project, for example. I find it frustrating when others don‚Äôt operate in the same way as I do. I personally value self-sufficiency and logical performance highly so when others don‚Äôt also do this it bothers me. 

I am particularly indecisive and I take a long time to make big decisions mostly because I always weigh the pros and cons and sometimes there isn‚Äôt a clear ‚Äúbetter‚Äù answer, so that‚Äôs where I get stuck. However, I don‚Äôt usually change my mind afterward unless new information comes to light. 

I don‚Äôt think authority should be challenged just because it‚Äôs authority but I also don‚Äôt think they necessarily know better. The only times I break rules are when I am sure it‚Äôs necessary or definitely the right thing to do. I definitely like tradition and structure aspects of societal rules but have no problem questioning them and changing my opinions based on new information. 

Thanks for reading to the end! I hope these snippets are telling to those who are more knowledgeable of the subjects. I would appreciate any responses \^-\^",1603321568

ISTJ,"I discovered this sub today. Hi, everyone!

Here are some things that are fairly specific and I haven‚Äôt seen on online descriptions of ISTJs, but that I bet are common among our personality type.

1. I can‚Äôt stand getting to know you questions and job interview questions. Tell me about yourself? Horrid. What are your likes/dislikes/strengths/weaknesses? Ugh. Tell me about a time X happened? Kill me now.

2. Digging a hole I can‚Äôt climb out of. First I say something that turns out to be insensitive or mean, although it wasn‚Äôt intended that way and I had no idea it would sound bad. Then I keep talking, and talking, and talking, trying to either justify it or explain or *something* except that my natural inclination is to talk using logic and not emotions, which 100% makes things worse.

3. Horrendous public speaking abilities. The only way I can get by is by writing out everything I want to say word-for-word and reading it. There is no such thing as spontaneity. I‚Äôm far more likely to freeze up and say nothing at all than to say literally anything without it being perfectly planned out.

4. Difficulty with group conversations. It‚Äôs not that I have nothing to say or that I don‚Äôt want to speak up, but it‚Äôs so hard to find the right moment! At least with only one other person there are usually some obvious pauses, but with a group of three or more? Absolutely not. 

5. Focusing on the negatives. Notice how my previous four traits are all negative? It‚Äôs something I struggle with. I truly enjoy living my life but the way I express myself nearly always comes out as negative for some reason. 

6. I forced myself to add some positive things :) Procrastination. Yes, I procrastinate, but the level at which I do it is light years better than most people. Whereas others will wait to start an essay until an hour before it‚Äôs due, my procrastination means I will still leave myself enough time to finish with spare time at the end. The reason I consider it procrastination is because it won‚Äôt be my best effort if I leave it that long. Of course, I also just flat-out won‚Äôt do something sometimes. If I‚Äôve left it until there‚Äôs not enough time to finish, that means I already decided long ago that I wasn‚Äôt going to do it at all.

7. Understanding concepts very quickly. You only need to explain most things once for me to get it, and not even in detail. I may have some questions but they‚Äôre very specific and technical rather than a fundamental question that impacts the entire thing, if that makes sense.

8. Excellent time management. Those who aren‚Äôt punctual drive me up the wall. It‚Äôs so simple! Just allow enough time to get ready for something, transportation, and an extra 5-15 minutes on top of that in case the unexpected happens (which it usually does).",1602800261

ISTJ,"Throughout the life of this subreddit it's been common for people to come here asking for advice on how to emotionally connect and care for ISTJ loved ones. The trend, in my opinion stems from a generalised inability for people of our type to adequately display, understand and communicate their emotions.

So my questions are as follows:
1) why do **you** think we get such a vast quantity of these style of posts?
2) do you think it is a flaw in our personality or just a quirk?
3) should we strive to better communicate to our loved ones?

ISTJ,"Hi, I'm an INTP(F24), and I was in this FWB relationship with an ISTJ(M26). We clicked so well, like I've never felt like that with anyone else before (and he said the same thing about me). 

I knew he liked a girl when we first got to know each other (he said he sees a future with her), but he talked about her less and less every time we hung out and he would even choose to meet me over meeting the other girl, so I thought maybe he got more interested in me(perhaps?). So after a month of flirting back and forth, one day he told me he got exclusive with the girl, and I was so hurt that I ghosted him. 

He reached out to me several times, but I just don't understand why he felt the need to reach out to me, wanting to meet and talk to me when he already is in a exclusive committed relationship. After almost 2 weeks of ghosting him, I said I can meet him the next day, but he didn't reply and he didn't show up the next day. I'm still confused as to why he's behaving like this when all we were was FWB.",1602687439

ISTJ,"Hey ISTJs! I'm Derek (ENTJ). A few months ago, my friends and I created an MBTI-based dating/friends app called Boo. Some of you may have already heard of it (and know that our first version was actually barely usable). I wanted to let you know about it because we've made a lot of improvements since then and thought you'd be interested in trying it out.

Like many of us, we're hardcore MBTI lovers and enthusiasts and thought it strange that no MBTI app existed yet. We thought MBTI could fix a few problems with current dating apps.

For one, you are recommended people you‚Äôre statistically likely to love and understand effortlessly, instead of being forced to meet every single type of person. Second, you can save time, money, and emotional fatigue you would have spent on bad dates with no chemistry on other dating apps. Third, you can deeply understand each other‚Äôs personalities before you meet and in a way that was never possible before. And fourth, get in-depth dating advice and insight into how to attract and get along with anyone.

[Boo Telepathy Demo](https://i.redd.it/as9vermefvs51.gif)

Many of our users are using the app to make friends and foster deeper, more meaningful connections. We pretty much built this app for people like us, so I'd love to get your feedback on how we can make it better.

The app is completely free to use, with added features like Dating Telepathy that are part of a premium membership (to support our operations).

You can download the app through the Apple App Store and Google Play Store links on our website: [https://boo.dating](https://boo.dating/)

Those two are the people who are the closest with him in his family. I deeply care for him and I wish there is something I can do for him. I have gone through the similar situation, but as an ENFP my needs might be very different from his. I suggested that I want to be there for him, and go through the hard time with him. However,  he is way too rational when it come to things like this. He refuses my suggestion, I guess he wants to digest the sadness on his own. I am planning on go over to him, and accompany him no matter what he says. Even if he might get upset at me, but I want him to know that I am willing to be there physically for him.

It's such a nice and loving gesture and I want to do the same for him. But it seems like he always default to ""I'm good"" when I know he's not actually feeling good. Whenever he begins to complain, he'll stop himself and say ""meh, can't complain"" or ""I need some stress to thrive.""  I never want to pry or push, but it would be nice if he chooses to come to me.

To cope with this, we hold on for way too long. We both agreed that we had this sort of deal with past and future versions of ourselves, where present me will take an L for future me as long as future me remembers that past me took the L. This turns change and adapting into actually betraying myself and younger me, and I don't want to hurt the child. Also, I have tried adapting, and I think what happened was since I betrayed my past self, present me expects future me to betray me also and now I'm really pessimistic about the future and it's trippy.

ISTJ,"Hey guys, I have pressing question. I do not know if I am ESTJ or ISTJ. For a loooong time I have identified myself as an ISTJ... or an extroverted introvert. Basically, I am ambiverted.

However, I am finally second guessing myself after all my introverted friends keep saying I am extroverted. I guess the true extroverts also call me introverted. So nothing really helps.

I'll try to explain myself.

I would say I am extremely high energy. Like, really high energy. I can talk a monologue for a long time. Unfortunately, because of this, I am not the best listener as I prefer chaotic talking and interrupting.

But I do not enjoy going to parties. I guess I am not interested in the party culture because they aren't really pursuing hobbies that I like. I feel like everytime I hangout with friends, there is a plan XYZ what we are going to do. I like to plan ahead, I know that if I hang out with a friend, we will go out for a drive at night, go eat dinner, then finish a movie. If I don't get all these tasks done I do not feel fulfilled.

Unfortunately, I do consider myself an asshole. I do hear from people I am very egocentric. My parents say I need to take into consideration people's emotions more as I can be cold... However, I do have feelings! I do care about others, especially those I really really am close to.

I would say I am an initiator. I like to take control of things, or at least have someone who is also controlling to initiate. I talk a lot, and I am pretty social. I can talk to completely random people with no issue (maybe with some uncomfortability). What makes me extremely uncomfortable if I am not part of a social group. I hate feeling like a 3rd wheel. Moreover, I am not really part of a clique, but I guess I have some group of friends inside and outside of college. But I am not really intro fraternities, nor am I interested in being popular on instagram. But, I do like attention when I am showing physical merit, ex. a video of me playing piano lol.

When I was in college, basically id study till 10 PM. In between I would get lunch, either listen to music or find someone I like to talk to. But after 10 PM, I usually go down to the basement and bother anyone who is my friend. See if I can get them to play ping pong or watch southpark with me lol (it works half of the time!)

The reason why I have considered myself introverted is because I need time by myself. I am not HEAVILY extroverted. Some people I know just always want to be with people... but I do play classical piano a lot. and I guess I do not necessarily have to be with people physically... especially with covid. But even back then, if all my friends in college were busy for whatever reason, I would just video call someone. I feel like this is normal between both introverts and extroverts though, and I am really confused.

I do not know if I like team work. I like to be in charge of things, as I said before. But I usually study alone to maximize efficiency. I feel like studying with people too slow for me would drag me down. Moreover, I feel like studying with people too intelligent would make it hard for me to keep up. It is hard to find the balance. Plus, in school you have to learn everything yourself, otherwise you will fail the exams. I guess I do not know how I would be in a job yet. I feel like if I were to work in a team, everyone has to be competent. I do not like feeling slowed down at all. It completely stresses me out. I like to push push push to go faster. At least that is how I am in class lol.

Finally, my humor is extremely cold and dry. I find pissing off people energizing for me. I do enjoy provoking/trolling people both on the internet or IRL. I do come off as insensitive, but those are just what I hear. I tend to befriend ISTJs, ESTJs, and INTJs irl anyway.

ISTJ,"How would it work? I'm an ISTJ and I love my little ESFJ, she's really got me in touch with my Fi. She's obviously more bubbly and extroverted than me, but she's kind of cracking my nutshell at this point. I think I would've missed out on a lot of good times without her. She does me a lot of good. Both types are SJs, so generally we have this organised, conservative outlook on life, so don't expect any unwanted surprises. Not big ones in any case. We also value sincerity and honesty (strong inner moral compass), so we'd try to hide as least as possible. We're both in it for the long haul. I don't think a lack of stability or trust in a relationship would be an issue, though she might be a little hesitant to bring up controversial issues as emotional stability is of great importance to her. The question is what do I have to offer her? I was thinking she's rather people-dependant so I could teach her some objectivity and independence? To be able to perform that disconnect and make a rational decision instead of being carried by emotions, much like ISTJs. An ESFJ can easily overwork themselves by wanting to take care of as many people as possible. (We can too, admittedly, but by sense of duty instead of emotions). The biggest difference between us, is an ESFJs greatest desire is emotional harmony, while an ISTJs greatest desire is logical efficiency. There are times where one must be sacrificed for the other, which may arise problems, but if both types are mature, such a pair could be very strong, balancing each other's T and F.

ISTJ,"I had A first date with an ISTJ boy tonight and it was so different from what I am expected! 
As an ENFP, I am outgoing, chatty, emotionally open and curios and a go with the glow kinda gal. 

He was very reserved, methodical , a bit shy and awkward but very sweet. He‚Äôs never been in a relationship before and said that he is ready for something serious if the right person comes along. He was able to relax a bit more once I touched his arm and he was more touchy with me the whole night and very sweet. 

He was honest in that he had a great night but is  skeptical if we can work out bc of how different we are, but would like to see me again. I feel the same way.  Not only is he different from me, he‚Äôs very different from all the guys I‚Äôve dated. I do want somone who is more reliable, honest and loyal because in the past I‚Äôve gone for the charmer type and I end up getting hurt. 


Could this even work? How can an ENFP work with an ISTJ?",1601793996

ISTJ,"Hi! Hope everyone is well. It‚Äôs Jess (INFP) and Lou (ESFJ) here again from the So Syncd personality type dating app. Things have been going well with the app - we are growing quickly and over 150 couples have now found each other through So Syncd! We very much appreciate the feedback that some of you have shared and we are working hard on some big changes.

We wanted to flag our new podcast called Personality Love Lab. We noticed that there are a lot of resources about the theory behind Myers-Briggs but not many examples of how it plays out in real life. Personality Love Lab is a series of interviews with real couples of different personality types.

In the most recent episode, we interviewed Andy McNab (ex-special forces hero, functioning psychopath and best-selling author) and his wife, Lily. He‚Äôs an ISTP and she‚Äôs an ESFJ. The episode before is about a couple who met on So Syncd. We are yet to interview a couple where one of them is an ISTJ, but we're very keen to!

We are just starting to record the second season and we are looking for couples who are interested in being interviewed. It‚Äôs just audio and we can change your names if you‚Äôd prefer. The couples we‚Äôve interviewed so far have loved it. We even had someone cry because he was so touched by what his partner was saying (an ISTP of all the personality types!). Please email us at [hello@sosyncd.com](mailto:hello@sosyncd.com) if you are interested in taking part :-).

Anyway, we hope you find it interesting and would appreciate any feedback! It's available on Spotify, Google Podcasts and Apple Podcasts. Here are the links:

It has effectively come to a situation where I know her entire life story, whilst she knows minimally about me. She's clearly in love with me, and I am in love with her, but the fact that she barely knows me compared to how well I know her makes me feel a bit lonely in her company.

We‚Äôre in long distance relationship. He‚Äôs dead set on his way and won‚Äôt be able to see things from other point of view. He can be a dick sometimes and say things bluntly which I really appreciate that. I‚Äôm an INTJ and sometimes during conversations, I lost in my thought process and repeat things I already said to him or things he‚Äôs already knew. Then he would just snap and said stop saying it because he‚Äôs already known. He also came off a little bit of selfish and controlling. I discussed him the issues that could potentially ruin our relationship but he refused to listen. I told him to be patient with what I‚Äôm saying a bit more but he said he couldn‚Äôt be patient and tell me to DEAL WITH IT. He also craves for meaningful and deep relationship, every conversations have to be purposeful and bring some values to him which makes me nervous because of my INTJ‚Äôs spontaneity. This time I wanted to see his face a little more during our conversation but he told me I could just look at his photo. Logically I agreed with his points but they drove me mad internally.

The reason for this question is that I'm writing a comedy at the moment where the protagonist is pretty much one of y'all, an ISTJ. I've googled and researched a lot on what they're like, but of course since I'm writing a comedy (something I admittedly am not very good at) I have to find some humor in the personality type. I have managed to write a few funny scenarios, mainly playing on the methodical and precise structure of an ISTJ's schedule or their ""introvertedness"", but of course I have more writing to be done. And I also would like to modify some funny scenes I've already written down.

ISTJ,"The ISTJ's ""loyalism"" (let's call it that way) is a stereotypical trait I've never perceived as particularly fitting to me. In fact, it's one of the reasons I considered myself to be an INTJ for most of my teenage years.
I'm definitely more detached from family, my origins and even the past in general than most ISTJs I've seen posting on the Internet. Not a patriot, not a conservative, not a traditionalist in the broader sense of the term.

For now, I'd like to talk mostly about patriotism.

I'm not a patriot to my own country. I could talk for hours about how I just loathe Brazil as if my life there had been a gnawing, enduring torture session and do it ever so often‚Äîespecially now that I've moved to Portugal.

However, I've come to the realization that I would have definitely been more patriotic had I been born in countries like Germany, NZ, Canada, Denmark, Iceland, Estonia and so on. To me, those nations deserve some of my nationalistic sentiments.

My theory's that I'm taking the definition of patriotism and twisting it to fit my own views on how a country should work and what makes for an efficient, just society. 

In other words, I'm ""patriotic"" for other countries I personally consider worthy of my ""patriotism"" while bashing my own.

I have found myself to be an ISTJ-T and can barely hold myself when subjected to multitude of people conversations. Probably why I  ended up having only a handful of friends or not  sure if they are acquaintances even.

But recently I have been pushed towards the cliff of depression because I don't find myself having someone, whom I can call out for. Perhaps the fear of obligation or because the experience of having ignored by one or two friends of mine when I asked for their help with something could be the reason.

It isn't that I crave everyone's presence, let me be me honest.  But I suppose it wouldn't hurt to have a couple of friends whom you can call out for when in need right?

ISTJ,"As my first post here, I'll share a situation that happened to me last Sunday as I was meeting an acquaintance: my first ""tray with food falling on the ground in the middle of a busy shopping mall"".

Context: I'm generally stressed out because I've just moved to Portugal and still haven't got used to how things work here, though I prefer it here in comparison to Brazil. Also, I'm nervous about university (as one would expect).

I bought my lunch and was heading to sit somewhere within the limits of the full food court while also holding a backpack and an inappropriately big umbrella.
Suddenly, I lost my grip of the latter, then my balance and it was the tray's turn: my soda and pizzas fell on the ground‚Äîthis had been absolutely my fault.
Despite the major inconvenience, a couple decided to help me and stood there to alert passersby as I was asking someone to clean up the mess I'd made (much to the dismay of my mild social anxiety).
Once all was settled, I thanked everyone involved and went to encounter my acquaintance, who was eating at a table nearby. By the time I got there, I had luckily already erased this disastrous occurrence from my consciousness.
However, a few minutes later comes this couple with another tray and offers the same food I had ordered before. Skeptic at first (""did they add drugs to this?"") but then baffled, I accepted it (peer pressure also weighed heavily on this decision).
Now, of course I showed them my gratefulness, but I also felt as though I were a little baby. Rather than being happy I'd get to eat, I felt confused, awkward, ashamed and perhaps even humiliated. I begged my acquaintance to not speak of this event ever again.

After all, is this a common theme among ISTJs? Do people being overly kind bother you at all?",1600850012

ISTJ,"When I look online to see the stereotypes of each mbti type in high school ISTJ‚Äôs are usually categorized as the students who are teachers pets and get the best grades in the class. But that wasn‚Äôt true at all with me. There were some teachers I really liked and got along with and others that hated me. But I didn‚Äôt suck up to the ones who hated me because at the end of the day nothing would‚Äôve changed their mind about me. 

And as far as grades go, I had a 3.5 gpa (might‚Äôve been a little under like 3.3 I can‚Äôt remember) but it was by no means easy for me to get those grades. Nothing came easy to me at all and I would have to study way more than most people.

I am now in my mid thirties. I just don't know how to explain it I'll give some examples. Ill come out and say it I'm a conservative I tend to lean conservative I have conservative values however I do see the hypocrisy in some of the things conservative say. I'm pro 2nd amendment ,however I feel like some of the things that the very pro 2nd moment people say are a bit ridiculous and  excessive. I believe in God however I feel like a lot of times there's a lot of hypocrisy in the church culture and communities. I'm not a drinker I don't do drugs never have been. I never felt comfortable around those settings although I had many friends in high school that partook in drugs and drinking and I was perfectly fine being friends with them especially when they were sober but I always felt uncomfortable around them when they started doing drugs and drinking. I'm a car guy but I can't stand redneck culture either I like lifted trucks but I don't understand hillbillies.  I have one of my best friends who is a transgendered person known her way before It was "" cool"" to have transgendered friends I actually met her while she was transitioning in 2004. I don't claim to completely comprehend how or why she does what she does or feels what she does but that doesn't mean I can't be friends with her. I don't like woke culture I think it's sick and degenerative   however I do feel like some of the points that they are making coming from a good place of equality.  Anyway I was just wondering does anybody else feel this way where you just don't feel like you fit in anywhere sometimes I just wonder especially at work one day I feel like I am  smartest person in the Room.

ISTJ,"Hello! I'm (F21) an INxJ (my F and T are 50/50) dating an (M22) ISTJ for a couple months now. It's been the most healthiest relationship I've been in thus far. We vibe well in person and have amazing intellectual and emotional deep talks. Being both introverts we respect each others need for space. 

Despite this, when we're apart, I find the biggest difference between us is texting style. I'm someone who is an avid texter. I enjoy texting and I like to feel connected to someone when we're apart. My ISTJ boyfriend, however, is the complete opposite. He replies promptly and consistently, but the replies are typically very short and dry: like an ""okay!,"" ""indeed,"" ""aw,"" ""that's good."" I find it kills conversation. On text I'm typically an upbeat person so I'm usually the one who will chit chat more and keep it going, but on my bad days I get pretty irritated at those responses. I know I shouldn't take it personally, because I know he continues to tell me goodnight/goodmorning every day and calls me every night so I know he cares, but man those responses though. 

I'm pretty sure it's a personality thing. So to fellow ISTJs, what's your opinion on texting or your experiences with an SO with different texting styles? How did you compromise? What compromises do you suggest? Thanks!",1600556513

Yet, take me for example, I have been testing as both for years now. Just depends on the test for which results I get. Usually its 50/50 actually for the S/N part. I have never gotten concrete results.

So, is it possible to not actually be just one, but in the middle on one of the functions that you can be both... at the same time?

ISTJ,"Despite how long I've been in this sub, I still sometimes get that insecurity that I may not be an ISTJ despite people outside of myself who would even say the qualities are spot on. And I find it hard to find statements that are *oh that is definitely istj* that don't overlap with another type.

Anyways! **My main question is how does mental health affect you as an ISTJ?** 

I think I tend to fall into imposter syndrome with lower mental health and 'bad' seasons because I lose those qualities like being reliable and getting things done perfectly. I do tend to daydream, which I know many say aren't istj, but it's mostly when I am stressed and can't stay present in my surroundings. And rules and details start to go over my head.

ISTJ,"I need advice with a situation that's completely new to me, and that confuses me a lot. I thought fellow ISTJs could give me some sort of guidance.

* Me: \[26M / ISTJ\]. Her: \[25F / INFP\]. As a reference, we do relate to many of the common stereotypes of these two types.
* She asked me out about 2 months ago, which turned my world upside down because I had never thought she saw me that way  or that romance would ever be in my purview (we've known each other for 10 years, since high school, and became much closer afterwards, until we hadn't spoken for 5 years). So, until now, a significant other was never anything I had ever thought of or even really sought.
* Her passion and love is so sincere and forthright that I don't even know how to take it most of the time. I've spent my life completely avoiding attention, staying alone at all times and basically becoming a shut-in. I don't know what to do with this much attention and love. To me, loving someone is foreign; I don't know how to properly reciprocate. I don't know if I even can. Am I able to push down my selfishness and spend time for her that could otherwise be spent on myself?
* In a lot of ways, we're diametric opposites and we share very few of the same interests. She likes to go out to have fun, I love to stay in. She is an emotional person and embraces it, I stray away from strong emotion or opinions (much to her dismay often). She is all about video calls and chatting‚Äîasking me to say things when there's a silence going‚Äîand I find it awkward because most of the time I barely have anything to say, and I both don't like and don't do well at small talk. She takes great pride and interest in her cultural heritage, history, language; I care very little for that on my family's side. Etc.
* As a counterpoint to the above, we do have an emotional connection and a good level of mutual trust. We could be more open with our worries and thoughts, but we're both very introspective and that leads to discussions that are helpful for the both of us and which opens us to perspectives that we didn't have. She's an amazing person.
* My life's a mess (unemployed, live with my parents, no ambition). Hers has a direction (single mother, work, studies, her own place, dreams). I keep emphasizing this point with her, but it never seems to dissuade her. In fact, she's been the most powerful force in my life to get my shit together in a long time. But this feels like yet another incompatibility; can't even imagine what her family would think of me.
* I prevent myself from doing anything because I only ever see the negatives by making any decision or attempt. So my life has stalled, and it's the kind of narrow thinking that prevented me from seeing her advances years ago.
* On the kid part (a 3-year-old), I can't say I'm opposed to the idea of a kid, but it's another thing I never once considered, and I certainly don't think I'm ready for it the way I am now.
* I've asked a couple of other friends for advice a couple of months back. Their response boiled down to ""why not try it out."" The issue is that I can't help but think long term with something like this. And it's like this whole convoluted puzzle in my head, where I'm not sure if it'll end up being a positive thing for either of us, and I feel like I need to determine the answer right now.

In the end, I'm not sure what I'm even asking. It's just that any significant shift in life terrifies me and I can't even differentiate positive change from negative anymore. So I don't know what to do, or what I should do. I kinda like it when things are decided for me, so I don't have to make any decisions of my own.",1600382895

ISTJ,"\- He came across serious and intimidating when I met him. He‚Äôs not that talkative generally (but sometimes can be pretty talkative), blunt, and doesn‚Äôt smile much although he still has good manners.

\- He has a good work ethic but can be lazy at the same time. He‚Äôs been working since age 18, won scholarships, is on top of everything, gets all A‚Äôs, but also cheats on a lot of exams and likes joining group chats to split up work to get things done quicker.

\- He‚Äôs pretty nice and some people rely on him for help. He has given friends expensive chocolate, helped them cheat on exams, guided them through planning their classes for hours (which made him tired but he still helped), and lets people copy his work when they ask.

\- He‚Äôs impatient and has a bad temper. He dislikes doing things that take up too much time and hates things like lazy people who free ride during group work. He can also be quite confrontational when he thinks someone is crossing him.

\- He‚Äôs confident, decisive, tends to take charge as the group leader, and is a good planner. He can get anxious when things are out of his control such as not knowing the exact salary he‚Äôll end up with as a stable career (he wants 6 figures). In the past, what he was most anxious about was not being able to control who his future partner would be.

\- He‚Äôs assertive in going after what he wants like emailing professors for add codes when he isn‚Äôt eligible to take a class or sitting for an exam that he wasn‚Äôt supposed to take yet because the wait period wasn‚Äôt over yet.

\- Sometimes he can be sensitive over certain things and typically cries after we argue although he dislikes showing this side of himself because he views it as weakness. 

\- He‚Äôs family-oriented and has a very close relationship to them, so he doesn‚Äôt have many friends since the only people important to him are his family.

\- He‚Äôs very saving with money and good at calculating expenses (accounting major). He‚Äôs also organized.

\- Sometimes can get pretty negative about things he believes are right based on his logic. For example, he recently concluded he‚Äôs going to fail a class because he didn‚Äôt do well on the first few assignments. His logic was that if he did bad on those 2, the pattern will continue.

\- Loves free time and despises being busy. His ideal lifestyle would be to have no responsibilities so he can simply enjoy eating food, having fun outside, or relaxing at home.

\- He mostly doesn‚Äôt care what others think of him. He‚Äôll be cordial to avoid being disliked, but if he happens to be hated by someone, he won‚Äôt care about them. If necessarily, he‚Äôll still engage in conflict with others.",1599988558
ISTJ,"ISTJs of Reddit, I‚Äôm seeking your advice and feedback on my friendship dilemma...

I (45/F) am an INFP and my best friend (52/M) is an ISTJ. We work for the same company and have had a great mutually supportive and fun friendship over the past three years. We‚Äôd text every day and talk or hang out in person (until COVID) several days each week. We‚Äôve supported one another when we each faced serious health issues, accompanying one another to medical appointments and procedures. I helped him work through some emotional pain from a past relationship; he helped me with my confidence when I took on a high-level job and was doubting myself. We were so close that people often assumed that we were dating, but we‚Äôve only ever been very close friends. 

However, a few months ago my ISTJ bestie started avoiding me. He stopped returning my calls and responded to texts infrequently. I was patient for a couple of weeks as I knew he was super focused on and stressed about a DIY home improvement project that wasn‚Äôt going well and every time I did manage to talk to him he‚Äôd apologize and explain that he was just really busy with work and overwhelmed with this project. But after weeks of feeling like I was being increasingly ghosted, I very directly called him on it by text (since he wouldn‚Äôt answer my calls) and told him it didn‚Äôt seem like we were friends anymore and asked why. He admitted he‚Äôd been avoiding me because he now had a girlfriend and he was ‚Äúafraid to tell me‚Äù so he dealt with it by avoiding me. The girl he is now in a relationship with also works for the same company and she just left a 20-year relationship. 

I told him that I was confused and hurt that he didn‚Äôt feel like he could tell me about his relationship and instead chose to hide it from me by avoiding me. That doing so damaged the mutual trust and respect that our friendship was built on. He proceeded to tell me that he didn‚Äôt have time for family or friends right now or even time to do things he loves (running, riding his motorcycle, sketching) because his relationship is requiring ‚Äúfinancial, time and emotional commitments‚Äù that are new to him. I replied that it didn‚Äôt seem he was capable of reconciling and reconnecting with me right now, so I needed to say goodbye until he was. He responded, ‚Äúif/when I find some space you‚Äôll be the first to know.‚Äù That was two months ago and I haven‚Äôt heard from him since. 

A few things I would love your ISTJ insight on: 

(1)	My bestie usually is very direct and blunt, even about uncomfortable topics, which I‚Äôve always appreciated and admired. Why couldn‚Äôt he tell me he was in a relationship?  

(2)	Do you believe our friendship is salvageable? Or that he‚Äôll ever reach out to me again. And if so, what can I do to best support the repair of our friendship? 

(3)	I‚Äôm very concerned that the new relationship he‚Äôs in is unhealthy given she just left a 20-year relationship that she hasn't had time to process, his statement about not having time for family, friends, or things he loves, as well as his statement about financial commitments for her (he doesn‚Äôt have a lot of spare cash). Is this normal behavior for an ISTJ in the early stages of a relationship? And if he and I do start talking again, how can I best help and support him? I don‚Äôt want to undermine his relationship ‚Äì if he loves her, I want him to be happy. But I worry he is losing himself in the process and is going to get hurt in the end.

(4)	I would welcome anything else you‚Äôd like to comment on.  

Thank you for taking the time to read and respond!",1599976127

ISTJ,"Hello everyone, I am new to this community (and reddit in general), but I have been studying both the MBTI and the enneagram, along with several other personality tests, for several months now. I just thought it would be interesting to start a discussion about different ISTJ enneagram types and how they influence your behavior. I found a very good enneagram test at this site: [http://pstypes.blogspot.com/2009/11/pstypes-enneagram-test.html](http://pstypes.blogspot.com/2009/11/pstypes-enneagram-test.html) and my result from this site further confirmed my results from other tests, so if you haven't already figured out your type you could take this test. If you would be willing, I think it would be interesting to take the test (if you don't already know your type) and post your results below in the comments, along with a discussion of how the enneagram type along with your ISTJ result influences your behavior. Please post your comments down below along with your enneagram types and results based on the test linked above my fellow ISTJs!

I am an enneagram type six (sp/so) with a 612 tritype. My enneagram one influence is strong (almost as strong as my six influence), but I would still consider myself a primary type six. As an ISTJ enneagram six I wouldn't say that I am immediately distrustful of other people, rather I only begin to distrust somebody if they specifically give me a reason to distrust them. For example, if I catch somebody lying to me I will kind of hone in on their behavior to see if I can catch any further lies, and the more they lie to me the more distrustful of them I become. I also don't specifically go out of my way to test people to see if they are trustworthy, instead I observe their patterns of behavior over time to see if I can count on them to stand by my side even when things are difficult. 

Although I am not distrusting of other people in general, I will admit I can be a bit paranoid and go into worst-case thinking often. For example, I always stress out quite a bit whenever I have something like a test of job interview. I also tend to worry about how my actions could impact those close to me and I get very stressed out by conflict.

As far as the loyalty aspect of the enneagram type six (and just ISTJs in general) goes, I would say that I am very loyal to my friends and family members. In fact, for my career I was originally planning on going to medical school, but after observing how the hectic work hours of medical school, residency, and just being a doctor in general would impact my time with my family I decided to switch to nursing instead (yes, I am aware that nursing is also difficult, but it is not as bad as being a doctor or medical school). I also was willing to be kind of an accountability partner in a way for a friend of mine who is struggling with an addiction, and I have tried to do what I can to help support him in overcoming it.

I obey laws and rules for the most part, and it does bother me whenever other people disregard the rules for no valid reason or if they think they are above them. However, if a rule goes against my own moral beliefs, or if I believe the rule is flawed I am not afraid to question it. Additionally, in true enneagram six, one, and ISTJ fashion I have always been a bit of a perfectionist to the point where the lowest grade I have gotten since ninth grade has been an A-. However, I do not enjoy working overtime at jobs because it takes away time to be with my friends and family, so I specifically look for jobs where I do not have to do a ton of overtime when I can.

I also know several other ISTJs in my life. For example, my dad and two of my brothers are ISTJs. I would say that my oldest brother is also an ISTJ enneagram six, but unfortunately he got in with a bad group of friends when he was a young teenager, so he now struggles with some addictions that he developed during that time and is not healthy right now. My other brother is an ISTJ enneagram five, and when I first read about the enneagram five description it kind of made me laugh how true the description is for him. As we all know, ISTJs in general are a bit reserved and can be a bit distant, but my ISTJ enneagram five brother makes me look loud in comparison. He is very reserved and definitely a man of few words, but also very intelligent. He loves researching things on his own and knows many things about a variety of intellectual topics. It's also interesting because he definitely breaks the ISTJ stereotype of being a perfectionist because he has always struggled to get himself to do homework for school because he thinks it's pointless to do homework for a subject he already understands, so despite being very smart his grades before college were not that great. He is doing better now in college though because his actual career depends on his performance now.

Lastly, my dad is an ISTJ enneagram nine, so growing up he never was all that strict with me, unlike what you see in some movies with ISTJ parents such as Brave or how strict Professor Mcgonagall was in Harry Potter. In general, he is very easy-going and very rarely gets visibly angry. He also is most definitely not a perfectionist either, although he does do what is required of him at his job and to help take care of our family.

ISTJ,"I've noticed a pattern in ISTJ descriptions by various MBTI testing sites. I'd love to hear your thoughts, maybe someone feels the same.

For example, obedience to authority. Apparently, all ISTJs are blind followers. Sure, I respect authority, but I don't necessarily want to be guided. I also don't think someone is necessarily more capable than me if he's in a position of authority. I will not respect anyone unless they've proven to be capable.

Blind following of rules and procedures. Honestly, most rules and procedures suck. They don't need to exist at all or they need to be changed. I absolutely love to improvise, I hate hate hate miniscule planning. Sure, I plan, but my plans are broad and I've never made a list in my life, I just have a broad outline of how to do something, details get worked on as they come up, as I adapt to the situation.

Extreme tidiness and cleanliness. My desk is a mess, I never write anything down, my clothes are all over the place, my desktop is full of random icons.

No abstract thinking allowed. Why? Abstract thought affects reality, which has practical consequences. Sure, telling me that the universe is 5 gazzillion miles wide is completely irrelevant to me, so is debating about how many angels can fit on a needle pin. But abstract thought is something I do all the time because abstract things like values, way of thikning and attitudes affect our reality.

Robotic coldness and not thinking about future consequences. This is kinda the most ridiculous one. Sure, I'm not open because most people don't really interest me. But opening up to people, kidding around and being friendly is not against our nature at all. I also very often think about the future, I'm certainly more focused on the future than on the present.",1599745489

I thought she wasn‚Äôt into me but she‚Äôd invite me to eat with her and ESTJ before labs, even let me touch her lower back for longer than normal when we were talking ! 

At the end of the lab sessions she asked for my number and made up a reason which didn‚Äôt make too much sense, and we exchanged them. Because my Fe is low, i didn‚Äôt catch on, I kept on asking her using the bs reason. Fumble it in the end.

My questions to ISTJs, are: 

1. How‚Äôd you show you like someone romantically ? 

2. What‚Äôd you do when they don‚Äôt catch on to your signals ? 

3. What type of guys do you usually go for ?",1599517732
ISTJ,"How do you guys feel about having your own children? Are there any ISTJs here with children? It's probably way too early for me to be asking these questions, but I've always disliked the idea of having kids, as I can't deal with other people's out of control emotions well enough. Although, I'd still feel guilty for never having one at all. Also how do you deal with kids too? Like with babysitting and shit",1599517469

ISTJ,"I'm not about to blame an entire personality type for my own weakness but I'm here to see if I'm the only ISTJ who has to face this.

I don't talk much but since I was a teenager until this day (it got better a little) but I have this tendency to speak what I think without being able to understand how it might affect other people's emotions.

For example, I'll say something stupid like ""Yeah, trying a baby is hard at your age. I hope you froze your eggs"" in a concerned context. Someone might agree that everything from the sentences are facts but boy, won't the person listening to that statement hate me if I say something like that.

And that's the problem, sometimes, I can't tell beforehand that it WOULD hurt someone since me responding to a statement using mostly logic (and sometimes forget that I'm talking to humans with emotions and struggles) feels like a reflex. And when I do later realize how bad my statement is, I will regret even talking. I would never want to emotionally hurt someone that did nothing wrong to me.

I've had friends that literally laughed at me for being too honest (and I thought I was just interacting like a normal person). I've had problems with being friends with people, mostly feelers. I don't blame them, it must kill the feelers to be with someone who can't tell how people might feel.

Now I'm friends with all the not so-easily-emotionally-affected thinkers.",1599466212

ISTJ,"So I've (F21 between an  INFJ/INTJ) been dating my ISTJ boyfriend (M21) for about a month now. He opened up briefly that he wasn't a really open person, but felt open around me. We talked about past relationships, mental health, and a bit about childhood. After awhile he stopped the conversation and said ""that's enough emotional talk for today."" When he's stressed about something like work, I'll usually ask him how he's doing and he'll briefly rant and then stop himself and say, ""it's okay, can't complain."" I want him to know that he can open up to me and that we can discuss anything. 

I'm currently in therapy to heal from my past, and he's always been supportive and would ask me how it went and that he's okay with me telling him if I'm comfortable enough to share. But since I'm not sure how to gauge what he can handle, I usually just keep things brief as well. I don't know. I want to fully open up too, but I don't know if he's ready. I guess, how can I get him to be more open? Or maybe how can I start a conversation on this topic? It's also important to note that I have an anxious attachment style, and I'm still trying to figure out his. I don't know if he's an avoidant or it's just his personality type.

I mean, I have a lot of trouble sleeping and staying asleep and I wonder if that is something that tends to happen with other ISTJs. 

I have a very light sleep and I wake up easily. Sometimes I even wake up about 5 times during the night. I particularly feel better when I sleep a few hours at night and take a nap in the afternoon. I can't always do that because of the routine, so I'm a tired person. I tend to feel more tired in the morning and as the night comes I get a little more awake.

ISTJ,"My ISTJ SO (39M) of five years recently made some comments about me being afraid to go out alone. He isn‚Äôt exactly wrong. I won‚Äôt go walking alone after dark. We live in what I would consider a medium-risk crime area. A woman was recently robbed at gunpoint two blocks from my home as she was out walking her dog in broad daylight. 

He blames it on the fact that I listen to a lot of true crime podcasts, but tonight I told him, ‚ÄúIf you had experienced some of the same things I have experienced, that MANY women have experienced, you would probably be afraid, too. 

I proceeded to tell him that I had been stalked twice before by strangers who then followed me home. I then went on to tell him the story of probably the most traumatic thing that ever happened to me: being chased down a country highway by a drugged-out stranger/lunatic. I am 100% sure I had told him the story before, but he said, ‚ÄúHmm. What happened again? I don‚Äôt remember that.‚Äù 

So I started at the beginning and was recounting the entire scenario to him when he cuts me off and says, ‚ÄúCan you just get to the end and tell me what happened? I don‚Äôt need to hear all of the details of this bad event.‚Äù 

This leads me to believe that he must lack empathy because surely he saw the hurt in my eyes when I got up and walked away. Do you feel empathy for others, or is it hard for you to put yourself in their shoes? Do you feel empathetic for some people and not others, depending on your relationship? Does it depend on the mood you‚Äôre in? I guarantee the first time I told him that story, when we were newly dating, he probably pretended to care.",1599201980

ISTJ,"I know we don't tend to have a lot of friends. There are probably outlier ISTJs that have a ton of people they call friend, but not me. I have just a few, and I'm perfectly comfortable and happy with that.

But, I've often thought of the people that call me friend and how they fit into my world. There are people I've known for 30 years and keep in touch with even though we're 1k+ miles apart. Then there are the people that I've known for near a decade that I actually get to spend time with. ""Best friend"" always seemed too squishy for me to really call someone that. So I came up with a system based on how much time I would be willing to travel just to see a particular person.

The people I don't hang out with regularly who I'm just kind of friendly with are 5-minute friends. Those are people I won't go out of my way to see, but if they happen to be in the lobby of whatever building I'm in, I'll go down and see them for a bit.

The people I do hang out with, when I can be convinced that going out is something I can tolerate, those are 10-minute to 30-minute friends. I can deal with that much travel to see them.

I'm not sure there is anyone in my life that it would take me more than 30 minutes but less than several hours to get to and that I would be willing to make that time for them.

The ones I've known for 30+ years and still want to be around, those are generally 4+-hour friends. I think I have three of those. I will hop on a plane and spend 4 or more hours just to see them. Not at the drop of a hat, of course. Things like that need to be planned in advance.

I hardly ever tell people about this organization system because I'm pretty sure a lot of people would be offended; however, I have told a few and they generally seem to think it's a great system.

So, there's not really a question to this, but if there were...

Do you organize your friends, mentally at least, similarly? And if you do, would you tell someone they're a 5-minute friend?",1599174147

ISTJ,"My ISTJ sister is six years older, with children. She lives far away, so our primary communication is the phone or email. Lately, she has not responded to email messages. One of her fears is that I'll convey information to our INFJ mom. She doesn't talk about herself very much but will talk about the kids. When we talk, she still messes up my name and puts the kids' names in place of mine, or vice versa. Because I'm an ENFP, I've always acted fairly young. I want to be able to help her and her kids - she is very much ""I can do everything"" and doesn't encourage the kids to seek help in English or help from me, though I teach both. (I can help when visiting - also with things around the house.) Sometimes I'll send articles to her or other things to say ""I love you"" but no response lately. We lost our dad recently, and she wasn't able to come for the funeral, so we talked then. It was very hard for her because she was so close to him in spirit. I told her friends here, and they wrote her. She doesn't have many (any) friends, and her husband is a bit controlling; he is kind of okay with me but talks down about my family to the children, and that passes on to their attitudes. When my sister talks to me, she sees her role as advice giver and organizer. I love her, but we are so very different. I'm not able to visit right now because of COVID, so I've been sending gifts to the kids and emails with animal videos, and sending shopping suggestions and funny things to her.

And then comes the ISFP with an inferiority complex that hides her insecurity by being unnecessarily dominant, minus the ability of making the right decisions. She is bossy, always asking people to do this and that (while not being a superior) and I learn fast, so I concluded that, okay, she's efficient.

So when I work with her, I'll be efficient. I'll get my job done fast. But her being efficient only lasts as long as she's in the mood to be efficient.

Also, delete socials/accounts/messages constantly or just never join them like insta or sc. But for more official socials like fb used by everyone at uni, I won't use messenger to text often but still check them regularly. I don't post anything, have my location, friend list and everything else as private. I'll go out with friends but no too often (except if they're my super close friends). I like to remember everyone/interactions but not everyone remembers me which is the way I like it, makes me seem more attentive then I actually am. And it's not like I don't reveal information about myself, I do but I'm more of a conversation/discussion director (like ask questions and provide objective comments).

ISTJ,"INTJ (F) here.  I have an ISTJ (M) friend whom I like. We've been friends for over a year now, but we've known each other for several years, through common friends. A good friend of mine also happens to be his cousin. 

I think our friendship started when I helped him revise for a French speaking exam at school. Idk why I helped him. I hadn't talked to him in years up until that point. We had common friends so we were always in common proximity with each other and we simply started talking more. He would try to get to know me better and make me laugh. I enjoyed spending time with him, and I eventually caught feelings for him as well. 

Our friends started to notice. They kept pointing it out in front of him, and in response he tried to keep a distance from me. That didn't last long though. But he would go out of his way to make sure that I know he doesn't pay attention to me, and would say things that imply that we're not that close? Even though he didn't act like it. I knew he still had feelings for me because he would always treat me differently but now I feel like I can't be direct with him because he's hesitant to talk about this.

My guess is that he thinks I don't like him back and is afraid that I will reject him if he does tell me. I don't know how to approach this situation. Also, due to quarantine, I haven't seen him in months.  I will see him in a few days though, since school is reopening. But I hope that he hasn't moved on.",1598516847

ISTJ,"Yes, I know - everyone is capable of cheating and I can‚Äôt narrow it down to only personality type. 

I‚Äôve been with my ISTJ boyfriend for almost three years now. I‚Äôm an INFJ. A few months after we started dating, I could tell he was all in, and deeply committed. He introduced me to his family pretty fast. I think he could tell right off I was ‚Äúthe one.‚Äù I do feel the same way about him, by the way. We definitely want to get married and have kids in the future. 

Of course, he took so long to open up and still doesn‚Äôt really show his emotions much. But, I still feel affection from him in other ways so it doesn‚Äôt bother me anymore. I know he loves me so much and cares about me, even if he doesn‚Äôt show it super outwardly. I can just tell by the way he looks at me. We have the cutest lil nicknames for each other and truly are best friends. We are so happy together. He even went so far to make me a ‚Äú52 reasons why I love you‚Äù for our two year anniversary and a couple of the cards read: ‚Äúyou trust me‚Äù and ‚ÄúI can trust you.‚Äù

I swear, this guy is a TEXTBOOK ISTJ. Doesn‚Äôt show emotions a whole lot, work oriented and extremely dependable at work. He‚Äôs getting his degree in accounting. He‚Äôs one of those people you can just tell are loyal and dependable, so me questioning him threw me for a loop.

I know this is going to seem like I‚Äôm blowing things out of proportion (and I am), but I‚Äôve been freaking out for a while now that he cheated on me early on in our relationship because I once kissed him and tasted something that resembled *for lack of better term* vagina on his lips. Literally have no clue what it was to this day, but his sweat sometimes smells the same so it could have just been bad breath that resembled the smell I have in mind. Also, he was at his dad‚Äôs house that day I believe. But, I don‚Äôt remember anything else but kissing him and tasting it. I never even asked him about it that day because it seemed outrageous to think. Also, tmi and side note ‚Äî we both lost our virginity to each other way AFTER this incident. So, if anything, it would have just been oral. SO ‚Äî HIGHLY unlikely, but it didn‚Äôt stop me from overthinking, and eventually, bringing it up to him ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

He never got defensive, just said that he would never do anything to hurt me or break my heart. He said that cheating would be the worst possible thing to do to someone, and that he hopes I would leave if he ever did. He had no clue what I tasted on his lips. He has told me to breathe and remember all the good things we have in our relationship when I overthink. He says he can‚Äôt even imagine cheating on me, and that hypothetically if he did, he would have told me when I FIRST asked him months ago. He has vented to both of his parents about the situation. His mom and I are pretty close, and she said he was in tears one day because of how out of control and worried I feel, and he can‚Äôt do anything about it. 

Side note - his parents got divorced and remarried multiple times, and there was cheating going on some with his parents. I feel like he understands the pain it causes. 

I‚Äôve been bothering him about this for months now and I have a bit of OCD so I get stuck in quite the mental loop. I‚Äôm actually seeing a therapist for this current issue, because he‚Äôs so worth it. Needless to say, he‚Äôs put up with me THE ENTIRE TIME I‚Äôve been obsessing over this. He‚Äôs let me continue asking him (which I feel like shit for questioning his loyalty; I never have and this came out of no where and I blew it out of proportion) and has not once been defensive, just frustrated and annoyed at times. 

Do you guys feel he‚Äôs being honest? Or could he really just be an amazing liar? I feel like my answer is obvious and I just need to trust him, but I was curious if it‚Äôs a likely scenario he‚Äôs lying? If he was lying, he probably would have left me a long time ago and not put up with me constantly asking. And, like I mentioned earlier, why would he have made me a ‚Äúyou trust me‚Äù card for our two year anniversary without feeling IMMENSE guilt writing that? My parents think I‚Äôm nuts honestly. They tell me he would never do anything like that, because they know him pretty well. I feel like my parents have a good judge of one‚Äôs character.

ISTJ,"&gt; **Si:** Your ISTJ is acutely aware of personal impact and past precedent. This trait includes the ability to recall events and exchanges of personal significance with immense detail and clarity. This function allows your ISTJ to form memories with such detail that they are experienced as reliving the event. Because of this your ISTJ unit is uniquely sensitive to changes in it‚Äôs environment and people around it. Your ISTJ is also strongly aware of it‚Äôs own physical sensations and comfort as well as the physical comfort of those it is near. 

How should we listen or go along with your conversation when you are recalling painful memories of the past?  


&gt; **Ne:**¬†Your ISTJ is prone to catastrophizing about the future due to the inferior placement of it‚Äôs Ne function. Your ISTJ will be resistant to change and new ideas and is likely to dislike discussing hypothetical situations because of the stress they can induce.  

How should we soothe you when you are catastrophizing about the future in a way that you recall past events using your Si in a manner that is highly disagreeable? Causing abrupt reaction whether verbal, physical etc...?

&amp;#x200B;

It's not that I don't care about my room aesthetic, I do, a lot. My stuff has to look beautiful. But I don't own decorations or particularly value them.

Now, there was a long party, and everyone got really drunk. I spent most of the party talking to my brother about our studies and philosophy. People saw me sitting alone and started to beg me to join dancing and asked if something was wrong, why I looked so sad.

I said everything was okay, that I can't and won't dance, and that alcohol does not make me happy or outgoing.
I'm a big guy too (6'8 370lb), so i takes a lot for me to get drunk, so even though I had been drinking the whole time it did not really affect me that much.

I refused my sister, father, and random people so many times. I just can't stand on a floor and hop around, it makes no sense to me. It almost made me sad to see their faces, I hate to refuse people. Poor guy that won't dance I guess.

ISTJ,"I need you all to help me understand this.

I have been dating my ISTJ bf for several months.  We normally see each other on the on the weekends, sometimes once or twice during the week.

We both had a three day weekend this weekend.  I was looking forward to it and to seeing him all week.  Friday he said he had a bad week and we hadn't made any plans for the weekend.  I talked to him Saturday and he said he'd had a bad a week and wanted to stay in that day.  I said ok, no worries, if he changed his mind to let me know or there was always Sunday or whatever.  I understand he needs his time and space and I just let him be.

So I didn't hear from him until 6pm Sunday.  I spent the day Sunday thinking that he didn't want to see me but then he said he'd been working hard on something all day, no detail here, but something I know is important to him that he said he'd be working on in not so many words.  He said he was frustrated.  I get it, I do.  

It's now Monday and my three day weekend has been basically ruined.  I have done nothing, been alone and frustrated and cooped up.  It is frustrating.

Is it normal for you all to get involved in something or want to withdraw to the point where you just don't consider the rest of your life?  Particularly the feelings of another person with whom you are very close? I don't understand how even if he is busy, which I get, I truly do, and honestly he is under no obligation to spend weekend time with me, that he couldn't just say hey do you want to meet up for dinner for a couple of hours.  

I am not worried that he's leaving me or anything, it's just that this is the first time this has happened and I just am struggling very hard to understand what is happening.  

Thanks.",1597077928

It‚Äôs pretty refreshing. I don‚Äôt feel like I need to guess where I stand by the fact that he texts me a lot.. However, he doesn‚Äôt flirt much, speaks so directly and matter of factly, almost serious all the time. Doesn‚Äôt really say nice things to you. 
Like when I ask him the next day after spending the night in his bed, in an attempt to flirt, so ‚Äúdid you wash your sheets?‚Äù he said ‚Äúnot yet but I probably should‚Äù. I said, ‚Äúoh so now it smells of me :)‚Äù He said, ‚Äúactually no because of the air freshener in the room.‚Äù ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

ISTJ,"Hey everyone.

My name is Oliver Powell. I'm a psychologist and my personality type is is ESTP 8w7 sx/sp.

I wanted to give all of you a warning, as I ran a check on the YouTuber CS Joseph and I found out that he's full of bullshits. He is a con artist and he is horrible at typology.

1. MBTI is about cognitive preferences. It doesn't automatically equal skills. Chase doesn't keep that in mind, so he ends up using a lot of bullshit stereotypes. No wonder that he mistypes a lot of people.
2. Any combo of enneagram and MBTI is possible. Enneagram covers basic motivations... But he disregards the enneagram, fusing automatically basic motivations within cognitive functions, ending up easily mistyping people. For instance he insists in claiming that Frank James is an INFP, when Frank James is an INFJ with enneagram 4w5.
3. Some of the concepts that he talks about are in a nutshell a bastardized version of socionics model A, but repackaged with different terminology. For instance his ""four sides of the mind"" are called in socionics model A as ego block, id block (unconscious ego), super id block (subconscious ego) and superego block.
4. He isn‚Äôt an ENTP as he claims. Chase is an unhealthy ESTJ (ego Te Si Ne Fi) 6w5 SO 613 often stuck in Te-Ne loops and on top of that he has most likely ASPD.

First of all Chase is a Te Dom:

4D valued Leading/Dominant Te: ""*Extroverted logic as base function is manifested as a need to accumulate factual information, also from external sources such as books, second-hand information, etc, on matters of personal interest or of professional activity. This also gives these types confidence on being well-informed on the same matters, which enables them to enter arguments related to them with confidence on their knowledge, which may come across as arrogance to others. Another manifestation is an evaluation of external reality - work activities, world events, finances, procedures, personal relationships, conversations - from the point of view of factual accuracy and ""making sense"" and efficiency. It leads to an inclination to be proactive in increasing the efficiency and reasonableness of the external world, as well as a sense of self-worth connected on being involved and productive in activities seen as useful, profitable, or that increase one's knowledge base. To give out information that the individual knows not to be factually accurate is disturbing and avoided as much as possible.""*

His second slot Si is poorly developed and he often turns it off, enganging often in Te-Ne loops:

*""ESTJs can also develop a warped or imbalanced use of their auxiliary function, Introverted Sensing (Si). When this happens,* ***they become obsessed with sticking to what they know, rapidly closing off alternate viewpoints and perspectives. They may become deeply upset by change¬† or they may become focused on seeing impracticalities in others. They may become so tied to their own personal, subjective experience that they discount other people‚Äôs experiences or are unwilling to see other perspectives.*** *Healthy Si is very aware of details, facts, sense-impressions, and important memories. It is practical, responsible, and highly attuned to changing patterns. Unhealthy Si feels that everything needs to fall in adherence with one‚Äôs own subjective experience of how things have always been.""*

\^ Hence the over-generalization that Chase makes all over in his videos.

Look at this description and you'll realize that his Ne is actually third slot, not first slot as he claims:

2D valued Mobilizing/Child: ""***The individual deeply appreciates people who are full of ideas and imagination and who give them a sense of connectedness to what is happening ""out there in the world,"" even if this information cannot be applied practically at the present momen****t. He is even more grateful for people who provide insightful ideas and unconventional analysis to enhance what he is working on or going through at the present moment.""*

You can see Chase often complimenting and appreciating people who are full of ideas, for example nominating in several occasion his mentor and talking about him.

Chase is often looping between Te and Ne:

*""When an ESTJ is in a Te-Ne loop, they are unable to effectively access their introverted functions, Si and Fi. During these times, they become obsessed with possibilities, but often in a negative light. They may see a million ways things could go wrong and try to ‚Äújump in‚Äù and fix them as quickly as possible without looking at the facts or taking the time to carefully observe the situation internally. They may have a difficult time prioritizing or reaching their goals and they may take hasty action on strange, intuitive whims without really understanding where their premonitions are coming from. This can be a very stressful stage for them as they feel more and more frustrated by their inability to organize, plan, and decide as effectively as they usually do. It‚Äôs important for ESTJs who realize they‚Äôre in a Te-Ne loop to get healthy access to Si. Take some time to enjoy some peace and quiet and reflect on an experience you enjoy. Find a favorite activity that you‚Äôve always enjoyed, whether it‚Äôs a crossword puzzle or cooking a certain meal, and repeat that process. Give yourself time to ‚Äúintrovert‚Äù and do some no-pressure detail-oriented project. Getting Si back into the picture will help you regain composure and get out of a loop.""*

As further proof of him being an ESTJ:

*- He finds Ni irritating (Ni being Vulnerable/Trickster for ESTJs), despising INFJs (the conflictuals of ESTJs) and having problems with INTJs (different methods to get effective results done).*

*- He praises a lot Ti, which in ESTJ is their Observing function, and in particular ISTPs. And the default communication style of ISTP is the best way to communicate with ESTJs.*

*- Love/hate relationship with high Fi users, but in particular xNFP types. It points to Fi Suggestive/Inferior.*

*- He is a more chaotic than usual for ESTJs due to being in Te-Ne loops.*

Some people think that Chase's main enneagram is 3w4, but what they're sensing is the disintegration phase of Chase.

Chase is an unhealthy 6w5.

*""Unhealthy 6w5 become increasingly paranoid and obsessed with maintaining their security, and may go to great lengths to protect their positions. They are extremely needy, and may abuse alcohol or drugs as a way of dealing with anxiety and paranoid delusions, as well as of bolstering their inferioirty feelings. The Five-wing adds elements of cynicism and nihilism to the fearful mentality of the unhealthy Six, resulting in growing isolation, desperation, and a capacity for sociopathic actions. Intense stress will likely lead to outbreaks of rage and extremely destructive behavior accompanied by breaks with reality. Self-sabotaging, self-destructive actions bring about humiliation and punishment to atone for guilt, although the extent and nature of their self-destructiveness will be hidden from others because of their reclusive nature. There may be strong propensity for violence as well as sadomasochistic tendencies in sexual expression. Murder and suicide are both real possibilities.""*

Primary instinct SO (social). Tritype 613, considering that one of his ex mentioned how much Chase tends to avoid conflicts (*main instinct core 1*) and his self esteem is based on achievements (*3 as main heart core*).

Unhealthy 613s disintegrate towards 349... 6 disintegrates to 3: competive and arrogant; 1 disintegrates to 4: moody and irrational \[*like claiming that the sperm becomes the brain, spine and nervous system... Look at the video analysis""What MBTI personality is sperm"" by FlowState lol*\]; 3 disintegrates to 9: \[disengaged and apathetic.

So the question is... Why he lies about his type?

The whole ENTP charade is how he justifies his unhealthy behaviours and avoids therapy.

Amongst his unhealthy behaviours, I‚Äôll mention that‚Ä¶

* Chase committed identity theft.
* One of his exes went to a therapist after frequenting him due to how much emotional damage he caused to her during their relationship.
* As mentioned by his ex Ande Sloeijk, Chase displayed behaviours that they‚Äôre congruent with someone with NPD (*amorous subtype*) or similar in their courtship.
* He persuaded a couple to avoid seeking help for their autistic son. Flowstate made a video analysis on the topic on Youtube. (**CS Joseph's Dangerous Advice | ""Ignore Your Son's Doctors"" | Criticism)**
* Pathological lying.
* A lot of passive-aggressiveness.
* Misleading information about his figure income to trick people into giving him more money. Flowstate made an approximate audit about Chase‚Äôs business (‚Äú**Cooking the Books: C.S. Joseph's Whopping 6 Figure Income Audited and Analyzed)**

It's highly likely that Chase has personality disorders. Probably ASPD in comorbity with NPD, but to say for sure a proper assessment would be needed.

Don‚Äôt donate to him. Don‚Äôt buy his services.

I have this natural desire (like most people I think) to comfort and make things better.

Than she says a team but it‚Äôs her team. She made a fuss she has a lot of work so we divided teams. Than she goes to boss abt I‚Äôm slow n I‚Äôm like on what n she goes a team. Turns out it‚Äôs her team. I‚Äôm like I can assist with your team if you like. The boss says I should go to her n get information out of her cause she is not one to ask for help. I‚Äôm thinking like this woman is sneaky already so why would I go out of my way for her when she can throw me under the bus again by going to boss saying I‚Äôm pushing her for info. 



Whenever I ask her to share something n she goes no. I have paper trail asking her what is she using to measure performance so I can make sure I‚Äôm delivering n she goes quiet. I cc the boss as well. After a week I ask
for updates n still quiet.

On another situation she messages me on skype chat n has boss on it. I‚Äôm working with my team. 5 min later boss messages : Don‚Äôt you see her msg???????

I‚Äôm like wtf. When I emailed n cc him he was quiet. Now for no reason he coming at me cause I didn‚Äôt reply 5 min??

Like I‚Äôm being double teamed. I‚Äôm a contractor n they full time. How do I play them?

This 40 year old woman lies a lot on conferences:
1. One day she says she is manager n than she tells others she is helpdesk. When things hit the fan she changes her title of what she tells others.

2. She started in November 2019 but she tells people she just started March 2020.

3. She sends me msgs she is frustrated or emails n than replies she should‚Äôve check vs emailing me.

4. She changes her story every second n the boss loves her.

5. She is always crying to just a nightmare to deal with.

How do I expose her to others?",1595852771

If I liked someone romantically my subconscious would tell me by having more thoughts about the things they said, their interests, and memories with them, which seems like an Si thing.

ISTJ,"So being INFP I posted a poll to INFP subreddit about how similar we are in terms of ""love and how we picture someone"". 

\------

This was my description for the poll (don't attack me. it's something i genuinely struggle with and am trying to fix): 

 When a semi attractive person acts kind of nice to me one time, I romanticize it until I fall in love with the idealized version of them in my own mind and not actually who they are in real life. Then I get to know them more and after I fall ""out of love"", I cringe and I'm like - why did I ever like this person? I must have been insane. And it was because I had fallen in love with the idea of someone they could be that they actually weren't but I was just blinded by my romanticized view of them to see the reality of who they were.

It happens to me so often that for almost all of my past ""crushes"", I'm cringing and thinking to myself - how could I have ever liked this person?

\------

I just thought I'd post the same poll for ISTJs because I'm curious how much the results could differ/be similar. I'm also going to post this poll to the other subreddits for the other types. Genuinely curious! Thanks!

ISTJ Anime characters list:

Vegeta - one of the most stereotypical ISTJs of all time and probably the best ISTJ character in anime ever of all time too, and this is coming from someone who is not even a huge Vegeta fan myself through the years, I prefer Goku but have been warming up to Vegeta as well too nowadays. In my opinion Vegeta is ISTJ, not ESTJ like I've been noticing him mistyped nowadays by some people. Depite this most people know Vegeta is ISTJ still and a introvert and Si dom for sure. The past is everything to Vegeta, he cares a lot about past details and experiences to insane and massive degree. He fears future possibilities with his Ne inferior function and hates things that sound strange to him or rejects negative possibilities on the regular including not seeing and reject the possibility that Goku is stronger than him all the time. Vegeta's entire Majin Vegeta transformation was Si, he noticed himself changing overtime into a good person and even liked it for a bit and having a family too but overall he hated this and that he started to like this peaceful. He states he wanted to go back to the way he was ""Before!"" Haha, this line is actually in both dubs for the bad inaccurate Funimation dub and better and more accurate translation of the Dragon Ball Z Kai dub in English as well a long with better voice acting by Funimations part. Anyways that line and Vegeta wanted to go back to the way he was before and how he used to be in the past is classic Si and Si dom behavior in Vegeta. Vegeta remembers past details to a insane degree and holds grudges from the past and cares about tradition and classism of the royal elite being stronger and better which he was taught to as a kid that his Si latched onto forever for his character and personality can become a core belief and tradition he follows forever in the series. The elite are born stronger and the low class are born weaker and will never be great or strong, that's the belief and traidition Vegeta believes with his Si and even goes well with his Fi tertiary values as well. He cares about efficiency, dominance, power, and task orientation and again this function for Te in Vegeta is secondary not first, he's a Te aux for sure even if he's a loud mouth sometimes, people underestimate how assertive Te actually is most the time. Te aux users might get mistaken as extroverts because of this loud mouth assertiveness they show at times but trust me Vegeta is definitely an introvert, stays to himself most the time, and is a Si dom for sure, no doubt in my mind. Overall Si duty, honor, memory, security, and classism is everything to Vegeta. In his fight against Goku they have a Si and Ne clash of ideals. Goku the ENFP and Ne dom who believes maybe its possible a low class Saiyan warrior can surpass an elite if he tries hard enough and is determined which Goku says before they start his fight with his Ne seeing possibilities to surpass a high class strong elite warrior like Vegeta. And Vegeta his opposite as an ISTJ and Si dom laughs and says I'll show you how big the wall between us really is, a Saiyan elite will never lose to a low class warrior, its just how it is from birth he believes here. Goku and Vegeta have the perfect ENFP vs ISTJ rivalry and relationship as fighters and friends. There types a both completely opposite of each other so it makes sense they see the world totally differently. There Ne vs Si disconnect is clear between them if you pay attention to their characters and the meaning of that fight between them. Vegeta is definitely ISTJ and an Si dom. One of the best ISTJs of all time, long live the Prince of all Saiyans, and this is coming from a past Vegeta hater and a Goku fan. Check out my Vegeta ISTJ post below for a more in depth analysis on Vegeta as an ISTJ:

In my opinion like many others Goku is definitely ENFP, but if you disagree on Goku for ENFP and are caught up in the ENFP vs ESFP debate with him, then check out my post here down below for why he's ENFP in my opinion and I‚Äôll link to some other posts too separate from my opinion made by other people as well that I agree with to level it out better and to share different opinions on Goku‚Äôs type by other people too. I‚Äôve seen ESFP posts for Goku and arguments but I disagree strongly with all of them that I read, even if I respect their opinion and still see tons of Ne and Si in Goku for Goku to be ENFP for sure definitely.

Here's Vegeta put on the Dragon Ball Z MBTI chart as an ISTJ, very good chart and very accurate in my opinion. The only ones I disagree with is Videl is ENTJ and Android 16 is ISFJ, but the rest of the characters on here and their types are spot on and very right and accurate to me for sure no doubt. It's an excellent MBTI anime chart, so be sure to check it out down below. Goku is also put here on this chart as ENFP as well along with Vegeta as ISTJ:

Jinbei - Duty and honor is everything to this character. Si basically is Jinbei and is whole character and I love him for it, Te aux is also a major part of his character. He cares about duty honor and tradition above all else and values security strongly too, and efficiency and staying on task with his Te is a must for Jinbei. He has strong Fi ter values and lives to follow his values to the end with everything he does in the world and in his life. He hates taking risks and fears Ne negative possibilities coming up, something he often struggles with when interacting with Luffy a ENFP and Ne dom himself. Jinbei is a very honorable man and takes on the pain and duty of others like taking on Fisher Tiger's pain and hardship and ideology on his own. What more can I say, its Jinbei, he's the best. Long live the great Jinbei.

Neji Hyuga - This man is one of the most traditional characters of all time. He believes in duty and tradition with his Si dom behavior to an absorb degree and remembers past details quite well. He learned this from his mixup with his father dying and the branch he was born in on birth. You are born who you are and you can't change that, that's destiny and that's how it is in life and you can never change who you are and who your born as or into family wise in this world, this is all the Si beliefs and traditions Neji believes in. Naruto has another Ne clash with him and says you can change and it is possible with his Ne but Neji rejects this ideology and statement he constantly says and says your failure and you can't change your fate or who you are. Their Ne vs Si fight continues and Naruto says at the end I'll change the way of the Hyuga clan with he Ne after he comes Hokage. Neji hears this but is reluctant until the very end after saying his failure line once more. Naruto comes up with an idea with his Ne to dig underground and have a shadow clone disguised as him over the hole and then bam hits him and uppercuts him in the chin where he least expects it. After Naruto's great Ne idea, Neji starts to change and accept Naruto's ideology and change his rigid Si beliefs a bit. When he fights the sound ninja and wins, he says Naruto saved him and he can do the same for Sasuke too. Overall this is a good change of pace for Neji and shows how he came around full circle and changed his Si traditions more as the show and series progressed and Naruto's life lessons changed him forever. Neji is ISTJ and Si dom for sure and one of the best ones.

Smoker from One Piece - Smoker is a massive Si dom and detail oriented and has amazing memory for details from the past. He could tell the two gators apart and compare and contrast them easily with his Si. He cares a lot about duty and serves his justice as a marine seriously and justly with his Si duty and Fi inner beliefs and values. He's a rather unique one because he's willing to disobey rules and authority for the sake of true justice and duty. But despite this we see how much he actually cares for tradition and rules with how he acts and behaves as a marine, he believes in duty above all else and says ""once a pirate, always a pirate"" showing he cares for tradition for people and that people never change no matter how much they look it in situations and in life sometimes to them. He fears negative possibilities with his Ne inferior and risks and values security with his Si above all else. He tells the marines to hold off when trying to capture Luffy and Buggy and says to play it safe and let them kill their selves off and then we swoop in and have them surrounded after they fight and tire each other out. Smoker is one of the most ISTJs guys of all time in anime and one that should be respected for his good sense of justice and inner values and logic too. Great character and excellent writing on Oda as usual.

I know separating from her is the right and wise thing to do. However, it still hurts. I‚Äôve lost someone I was deeply attached to and everyday I feel a wide array of emotions that I allow myself to feel (contrary to most ISTJs, I feel and express emotions very strongly).

If I tell him that I miss him is that too needy? Will he think that‚Äôs too emotional? I‚Äôm working hard to focus on him. But I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs something that someone would like to hear or if it‚Äôs emotionally burdensome.

He told me he enjoyed spending time with me and wanted to do other things than just hook up. We only have hung out 3 times though. With rising cases of Covid going on, poor guy is also dealing with a bad rash from allergies/stress, so we haven't been able to meet up and it's going to be like that for a bit. We keep in contact everyday, but he's pretty terrible at texting. He responds quickly but with one word answers usually, so we keep to just snapping each another photos and text occasionally to check in to say what's up or goodnight.

Being that he's not much of an enthusiastic texter (lol), I'm not sure how to do it with him. I always ask followup questions and he'll answer promptly, but since it's so brief I wonder if I'm annoying him, so I keep it short to match his style and the conversation dies. I really want to get to know him more, but not being able to see each other really puts us at a disadvantage.

I guess I just fear that by not being in contact much he'll lose interest or something and fade away. We vibe so well in person and I would hate to pass up the potential we got going. To fellow ISTJs on here how should I deal with communicating from a distance? Especially with someone who doesn't like texting. Also, do followup questions annoy you on text?

ISTJ,"I know we don't like to brag, but I feel like a humble brag every now and then is a bit healthy no? ;P 

Either way, I've had quite a few of those throughout the years (most of them the person who gave the compliment doesn't even know how much it meant, but I feel like that's a given at this point xP) but the one that stands out the most to me is, years ago when I still did chores around the house, we had a rotating schedule (which I designed to be quite effective...... don't mind me, starting the humble brag early) so for example, we'd all end up doing the laundry, putting it out to dry up, and folding it when it dries, at some point during the week.
One day my mom came out of her room with a piece of clothing that clearly doesn't belong to her or dad, and asked ""which one of you guys folded/put this in here?"" I was right in front of her so I answered immediately ""not me"" raising my hands up, to which she said ""yeah I can tell it's not you, you fold like how hotels fold their items"" (I can't think of a better conversion to English, excuse my lack of vocab n_n;) while smirking. I felt so much pride and giddiness xD 

So that's basically it really, to others it may not sound like much, or may even sound like an insult to some(?) I don't know, all I know is I never forgot those words and they still ring in my ears whenever I do my own laundry or just casually fold my clothes xP

ISTJ,"Apologies for the essay.

I got introduced to (more or less badgered into) MBTI two years ago by an ENFJ. Initially I tested as an ISTP, later INTP, briefly INTJ and now ISTJ. I‚Äôve always tried to take the tests with a grain of salt and rather used them as a blueprint, using any knowledge on cognitive functions I have to sort the rest out myself. I can see a trend in the results over time, but have never not been an IxTx.

I‚Äôm struggling to visualize it to myself, and that honestly comes down to how ISTJ‚Äôs are shown in the MBTI community. I‚Äôve only ever really seen them depicted as the typical conservative dad. However being as type doesn‚Äôt really have a whole lot of effect on one‚Äôs personal beliefs and standards, I don‚Äôt think that depiction is either accurate or does the type much justice. I for one am nowhere close to that depiction of the type. 

So allow me to describe myself as best I can;

‚Ä¢ I‚Äôm a security guard. I do the same tasks virtually the same time every day (unless I‚Äôm tired as I work the energy out of myself a lot), I struggle to pick up new approaches especially with removing people. My coworkers jokingly refer to me as ‚Äúthe punisher‚Äù because I ‚Äúwon‚Äôt chill the fuck out‚Äù.

‚Ä¢ I wear the same handful of clothes often as they suit practical needs, aren‚Äôt broken, and are comfortably broken in. When I lose a piece of clothing due to damage, I often feel a strong sense of remorse. Sometimes it‚Äôs almost like losing an old friend.

‚Ä¢ I live and die by a code of conduct that hasn‚Äôt seen much change over the years, despite my damnedest to make alterations. When things do need to change, I find I struggle to really struggle to get to them and will try and put it off. It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt know what needs to change, it‚Äôs just that I either melt down trying to find an alternative or don‚Äôt have time/money (like my wardrobe).

‚Ä¢ It is hard for me to really truly trust people and that can be dismissed as personal past reasons, but if you make it I‚Äôll die with you. I hold a lot of pride in being the punctual friend who is willing to jump into the fire with his comrades. I‚Äôve always been a good right hand man instead of leader, if said leader is going by a code I see as sound.

‚Ä¢ I am a watchdog, hence the job I‚Äôm currently in. Even if I don‚Äôt like it because it is tedious, I will make sure things are held to the standard set if I agree with them. I am not compromising normally, and I generally don‚Äôt care what your reasons are. Things are as they are, you and I won‚Äôt change that. Deal with it.

‚Ä¢ I end up being the level head and worker of the family. I‚Äôm a 5‚Äô8 mesomorph in a house of hobbits. When things need to be lifted or everyone has proven they can‚Äôt think clearly, I wind up taking charge. 

In naivety I thought I was an INTP because intuition and the fact I can‚Äôt get around to cleaning my room. The intuition may be from being a Pisces, and my inability to do certain necessary things like cleaning was dismissed as perceiving. For how low energy, laid back and goofy I can be I find myself struggling to see myself as an INTP. I think part of this can be just because of the fact that I never really was able to understand exactly how Si works, which is odd because I normally pick things apart until I understand them. I‚Äôve always had a hard time typing myself because contradictions and something coming along that makes me have to reconsider everything to make sure things are correct. I also find what is often described as ‚Äúgeneral aggression and vigor‚Äù that I‚Äôm told I display which has scared people before as an INTP trait. However I could be wrong, I understand my knowledge on MBTI isn‚Äôt the best, and I am in my early 20‚Äôs and still developing. So I‚Äôd really love to hear your guys‚Äô input.

Also, side note. You guys are great. Whether or not I am an ISTJ, I have a massive respect for you and I think you are stellar people. Thanks in advance.",1595296423

I like traditions. But more personal traditions. Like going to all of the movies of a series with the same friend, and if I would find out that my friend would watch that movie with someone else, I'd probably be pretty sad, because that was supposed to be our thing, you know. 
If I find a food I like or a drink, I'll probably stick to that for a while before trying something new.

I‚Äôm and INFJ (23F) who started dating an ISTJ (29M) about 2 months ago. Things were good up until I had what I can only describe as an ‚Äúemotional vomit‚Äù last week. It was a rough week for me personally and then on top of it he didn‚Äôt communicate on a rather important issue. I am normally not one to make myself vulnerable or express my deep emotions out loud like that. I‚Äôm now concerned that I might have scared him off as he expressed concerns about that ‚Äúemotional vomit‚Äù and he‚Äôs not sure if he wants to continue the relationship. He still texts me everyday but we haven‚Äôt talked about whether or not he wants to continue the relationship. I am trying to be patient and give him space to process it but I‚Äôm confused given the nature of his texts as well as the fact that after he told me about his concerns, he was still physically affectionate.

ISTJ,"
1. Is  there anything that may affect the way you answer the questions? For  example, a stressful time, mental illness, medications, special life  circumstances? Other useful information includes sex, age, and current  state of mind.

If you take the time to read my profile, you'll see that I have an Asperger's diagnosis (I have a few comorbid conditions alongside it) and I'm a female, 21, and my current state of mind is neutrality/numbness. 

2. Look at the random photo for about 30 seconds. After you're done, write about your first impression of it.

There's a lot of colors in the sky, there's some mountains, and there's a guy who's planning to climb them. Overall, it's a decent photo. 

3.  You are with a group of people in a car, heading to a different town to see your favorite band/artist/musician. Suddenly, the car breaks down  for an unknown reason in the middle of nowhere. What are your initial thoughts? What are your outward reactions?

My initial reaction would be to take control of the situation by trying to figure out solutions in order to fix the problem such as looking to see if there's any gas stations near by and/or if there's a tow service that could be called.

4.  You somehow make it to the concert. The driver wants to go to the after party that was announced (and assure you they won't drink so they can drive back later). How do you feel about this party? What do you do?

I suspect that they will anyway, but regardless, I would wait it out until they're sober enough to drive or if they're not and I haven't drank anything and/or I'm sober enough to drive, I will instead. In regards to how I feel about it, it depends on the party in question.

5. What would you do if you actually saw/experienced something that clashes with your previous beliefs, experiences, and habits?

I would reconsider my position/beliefs if it turns out to be factually incorrect, but it could take more than just one experience to change my position (it's depending on what position it is and what experience it was that made me reconsider it). 

6.  a) What about your personality most distinguishes you from everyone else? b) If you could change one thing about you personality, what would  it be? Why?

I would say that it's how brief/to the point I can be in communication and if I could change anything, I would be curious in seeing what it would be like to be more adept in navigating emotions (my own and others).

7. How do you treat hunches or gut feelings? 

I take them into account/see if they have any outward validity.

8. a) What activities energize you most? b) What activities drain you most?

Being alone and/or doing something productive (though, I'm not always). In terms of what drains me, I would say socializing too much if a conversation isn't interesting enough to engage in.  

10. What do you repress about your outward behavior or internal thought process when around others? 

My feelings and I tend to avoid getting too in touch with inner emotional sentiments.",1594952073

But the thing is, I have no idea what he feels about me. In person, it's great. When we're apart, however, he barely texts.

but lately, specifically with the idea of a female significant other, I find that I'm very attracted to those quite different from me...

It all started when I went to the bank recently and this woman around my age was working there and she helped explain a lot of finance related stuff to me, because I know hardly anything about all that..

It was just so attractive that she was more straight-forward, grounded, rooted more in thinking over feelings,
and just her knowing more about something I don't was super attractive...

And just really anytime I call this investing company where women usually answer, it's always so pleasant and attractive talking with someone who is quite different from me...

And then recently watching this suspense detective thriller, and one of the leads was this 30-something women who was just so grounded, analytical and a true thinker, but had this underlying sweetness ans gentleness which is incredibly attractive.
 
Probably something like a healthy INTJ or even ISTJ.

My dad is a very unhealthy abusive ISTJ and most men I've encountered in my life are, so it drove me away from
anyone different from me, especially with romantic relationships with women,

but now I'm becoming much more attracted to thinking-based women who are pragmatic and more analytical then I am... I always thought all ISTJ's were insensitive and emotionally abusive.

But the healthy ISTJ's and NTJ's are not insensitive or closed off from their feelings, which I learned recently.

It's extremely attractive to me, and I think being with a women who is like this is much better than being with someone who's so much like me.

In a romantic relationship, I think it creates a well balanced whole... and I can learn about different perspectives from a thinking-based analytical person, and she can learn more about feelings-based perspectives etc,

and all our fun hobbies rooted in our thinking minds and feelings- based hearts!

And two healthy individuals, where I personally am not without logic and analyzing, and she is not without feelings or sensitivity sounds amazing!",1594585713

Vegeta MBTI - Vegeta is ISTJ

Dragon Ball MBTI Types - Dragon Ball Z Myers-Briggs Types

Even if Vegeta isn't my favorite character in Dragon Ball, I still know a lot about him and actually been warming up to and liking his character overtime and lately overall. He's becoming one of my favorites and now I feel its a good time to share my opinion on him and talk about him and tell people why I think he's definitely ISTJ and one of the best ISTJs of all time in not only anime but in fiction in general, and is an Si dom. I hear you ESTJ Vegeta fans out there, I hear you and feel you and respect your opinions but here's my opinion for why Vegeta is ISTJ and definitely an Si dom in my opinion. This is a post and debate I had with someone a few months ago about his type and character since they said they were confused on him, so they asked me why I think Vegeta is ISTJ so I replied and responded with this argument I'm going to show you down below. So tell me your opinion down below and tell me your thoughts and opinions on if you agree or disagree with my ISTJ typing for Vegeta again. Here's the post now, enjoy and feel free to comment down below.

So why Vegeta is ISTJ. Vegeta is a person who makes decisions based on past details and past experiences and is very, very obsessed with the past! Vegeta is very stuck in the past, cares about duty and honor as a warrior, and was taught as a child about being high class and that he was the greatest thing since slice bread and that's the way it is and always will be, this mentality of high class and he's the best and strongest and always will be is seen as a tradition to him, massive Si. So when Goku comes along and surpasses these expectations with his nothing is impossible Ne for him as an ENFP and always seeing a step further for him in the future and always thinking of surpassing himself in the future the next day, Goku's Ne ideals conflicts directly with Vegeta's Si as an ISTJ. This is one of the reasons there such great ""rivals"" and go well together despite being complete opposites. Just to mention this part real quick, I know that there's people that think Goku is ESFP and I respect their opinion but disagree in my opinion and type Goku as ENFP. If you want to see my opinion down below, check it out here, I disagree with practicaltypings opinion and I also think their opinion will change overtime especially when they watch Dragon ball, but no matter. Here's my opinion down below for Goku ENFP if you want to see it and I also post some outside opinions from mine from other people to balance out my own. Check them all out down below, but this isn't a post about Goku. Despite Goku's ENFP vs ESFP debate, I'd say more people agree Vegeta is ISTJ but again for you ESTJ Vegeta fans I respect your opinion but hear me out and continue reading this whole post, form your opinion after reading and see if you still agree or disagree on my thoughts for why Vegeta is ISTJ and one of the best ones ever of all time as well. And by the way this is all from a non Vegeta fan, I used to hate Vegeta for the longest and still somewhat do but not as much anymore, I actually have been really loving his character now a lot more nowadays but not for the same reasons most people think and do usually. Alright enough rambling I'm going to finish my argument and opinion on Vegeta for ISTJ with also some Goku examples to directly contrast with Vegeta's character to help understand Vegeta better since they go well together as rivals and opposites in personality.

My own Goku post and opinion if your curious that I wrote a few years ago:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/czk51q/goku\_is\_an\_enfp\_and\_heres\_why\_dragon\_ball\_z\_mbti/](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/czk51q/goku_is_an_enfp_and_heres_why_dragon_ball_z_mbti/)

A nice Quora post I found debating this topic for Goku and I think is also a good separate discussion on Goku's type outside my opinion to ignore any bias or anything, I think it  has some good posts and definitely check out Josh Lee's post and opinion especially. His post is really good I feel for sure, even if I like and agree with both posts there myself too and he even brings up enneagram along with MBTI together which is something unique that I haven't seen someone do when discussing between ENFP vs ESFP with the debate for Goku's type, so be sure to check out Josh Lee's argument, its great whether you agree or disagree with his points:

[https://www.quora.com/What-is-Gokus-MBTI](https://www.quora.com/What-is-Gokus-MBTI)

He was also listed here by CBR to add onto the debate as well:

Now going back to my post, Goku always sees a possibility to improve as a fighter and martial artists, nothing is impossible to him no matter what people say. Goku is idealistic about fighting and everything he does with his Ne an Fi in my opinion and Vegeta hates all that and is always saying with his Si as an ISTJ, ""It's impossible Kakarot! You can't surpass me! This is the way it is! And the way it always be! It's all been like since you were born and my birth, its how its supposed to be with me being a high class Saiyan and you being a low class Saiyan, accept it you can't change! This is Si and what Vegeta believes in to his core, he's not open to new possibilities like Goku and as a result Vegeta clearly has inferior Ne. So when Goku proves himself with his Ne risk taking and seeing the possibility always to get stronger in the future no matter what, he surpasses him and trains in the spaceship on the way to Namek and completely surpasses Vegeta as there first bout and fight. After that its a wrap and Goku stays ahead of Vegeta forever. Vegeta despises this as we see! In lives in denial the entire series! Kakarot can't possibly be stronger than me! He says to himself, inferior Ne again. It's impossible! Low Ne haha as usual. Possibilities for change and going against the rules and traditions he was brought up with scares him and he hates the idea of it and then stubbornly with his Si obsesses over Goku and makes it his duty to surpass him and life's missions, which is Si as well since Si is driven by duty as well. We see Vegeta slowly change and grow and learn from his experiences over time and become a better person slowly as the series progresses and he starts developing with his Si into the nicer Vegeta we know today. Vegeta also remembers details from the past very well like in the Namek Saga on what people said and other details he remembers vividly he heard or experienced from the past. Now I've been waiting for this one, Majin Vegeta.

Vegeta's entire Majin Vegeta transformation and motivation is ISTJ and the most ISTJ thing ever. He brings up a bunch of details in the past and how Goku humiliated him in different ways in the past and we find out all the things he's been thinking about and remembering all these years and grudges from the past he has toward Goku that's been built up all this time. Vegeta says he wanted to go back to how he once was and noticed he's been changing into a good person living on Earth and having a family and he began to start liking it to his dismay. He states here that he hated this and wanted to go back to the way he was before when he was evil and merciless and the strongest again without having a kind heart at all like Goku or the other Earthlings he's made friends with. The past is everything to Vegeta and new possibilities for change and him changing scares him to the point he would let an evil wizard Babidi work his magic on him and let him turn evil again and get stronger just to go back to being evil once more and finally getting that fight with Goku once again that he's always been wanting to have all this time for years in the past now but never got a chance at doing because they had to keep saving the world against enemies and Goku decided to stay dead with eliminated his chance to fight Goku once more. Vegeta lives in the past and can't ever let it go, it means everything to him and his character and he'll do even extreme things just to bring his past self back once more as we've seen with his actions in the series and the entire Majin Vegeta motivation as I just mentioned and explained here. Vegeta is the stereotypical ISTJ, and he's very calm and introverted despite his assertiveness with his Te. He definitely uses Te with him being direct, assertive, and caring about efficiency and getting things done and being impatient with people and being so task oriented and training all the time just like Goku another Te user. And he's Fi and has strong inner values and doesn't care for others or their emotional state at all, he just cares for his own values and doesn't care much for society Fe values much at all. Vegeta is the type to feel very strongly emotionally inside about things just like Gohan an INFP or Goku an ENFP in my opinion. But Te dominance and efficiency comes before his Fi for sure and definitely Si is first and dominant in him with his obsession with the past and remembering details so well and being driven by duty, honor, and not letting go of past things as I've already mentioned in this post. Ok I'm done, that's why I type Vegeta ISTJ.

Kidding, here's a few more extra details I added for Vegeta as an ISTJ and Si dom, past the post I made above to add onto it. It's not too long, just a few more points I noticed here to point out and bring up.

Vegeta also again always remember details and past experiences and details very well. He remembered a lot of details on Namek and paid attention to when Gohan had the scouter and put two and two together for what happened to his Dragon Ball and figured out it was a Scouter for the Dragon Balls, which is all Si in Vegeta. He cares about security when Nappa impulsively destroys the town and thinks what if there was a Dragon Ball there you fool? With his inferior Ne. Vegeta waits for Goku and says he betrayed his duty as a Saiyan, which is all Si duty again. Honor and duty is everything to Vegeta along with the past and past details and experiences, which is Si again in him. Vegeta plays things safe with his Si by killing the Ginyu force members. He kills off specific key members of Frieza's forces as well that he remembers that are dangerous with his Si and wants to play things safe with Si security as well. I explained how Vegeta fears Ne above but at the same time he does use it still when necessary, as he came up with the idea to use the Earth's dragon balls to bring the people of Earth back to life and to speak to them and have them give energy and have Goku use the Spirit Bomb technique, so that's an example of Vegeta using his inferior Ne even if he struggles with it usually. Also Vegeta is introverted and to himself and is hotheaded with his Si strictness and Te assertiveness as well as we all know, but despite this he is still a very calm person overall and is very logical, levelheaded still, and strategic, and again cares about the past and past details to an extreme degree with his Si dom behavior.

ISTJ,"Hello all, seeking advice on here as I'm quite confused by this ISTJ guy's behaviour.

Little context, we have known each other for years but talked only sporadically. Only recently around three weeks ago we caught up again a bit out of the blue and started chatting waaaay more. It was really nice, so funny, his humour makes me giggle a lot, and we went on a distanced date (I suggested meeting, but he took on the organisation, which I hate doing, I'm ESFP). After the date we chatted for the whole week, I'm the one who initiates more but I don't mind and I am definitely more talkative and sort of drive the conversation, we chatted for hours until 3am for a few days. We met again last weekend, and we got quite close, I went to his place and stayed over for almost 24h! It was a lot of fun and I felt I was getting him to loosen up too, while being my spontaneous bubbly self. After the long date, he asked if I got home okay, and chatted a bit again (he said he had a great time). It's been 4 days ago and we have chatted a bit during this time, but not as intensely as last week. I usually start a conversation with something random and he replies with short practical answers (which is also what he used to do before, but I always kept the conversation going then!). I wonder if something I did scared him off, or I am just overthinking because something happened between us and I'm wary about initiating conversations now (while last week I didn't care). Maybe he's taking his time to figure some things out and I am just overthinking. So I'm wondering, should I worry that if I'm the only one to initiate conversations he doesn't care? Should I wait to see if he writes? I'd like to see him again soon but I'm not sure whether I should ask directly, I am a bit worried about being ""annoying"". Please help!",1594305422

ISTJ,"Hi!

Personabilities has created a new personality test called Intellabilities. It measures not the level but the range of your intelligence. It's kind of like a cross between MBTI and StrengthsFinder. We would love to know your thoughts on it. The test takes 10-15 minutes to take and afterwards you'll get a 40 page report on your intelligence abilities and personality. It will show you what specific abilities you have, what fields of study you should pursue (as in specific college majors), and what careers would be best for you.

We're curious if there's a correlation between being an ISTJ and Intellabilities types. Please comment what your Intellabilities type is down below.

ISTJ,"
If you have any questions that would help clarify whether I‚Äôm INFP or ISTJ, please dump them here. Beware, following text is quite long, in order for it to be as accurate as possible. 


Some general information about myself. 

Hobbies and interests: 

Literature, music, art and creating sentences by using letters from the alphabet, such as o: ‚Äúolfactory oppressors often open organs‚Äù, or s: ‚Äúspecial sandals soothe some sad socks‚Äù. The inspiration for this hobby is mainly the French postmodernist literary group Oulipo. 

Personality as described by others:

Others have described me as calm, odd, intelligent, tense, aloof, sweet and nerdy. The person I talk to the most says I‚Äôm very smart and very dumb at the same time. This person also often says I‚Äôm too sensitive. (Please note that I‚Äôm not saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so smart‚Äù. I think the opposite, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm anything particularly important or special. Mentioned above is what others frequently say about me.) 

How I view myself:

Calm, mainly interested in reading books and being somewhere I feel comfortable. Lazy. Focused. Detail oriented. Don‚Äôt care much about money. Quiet. Sentimental. 
I don‚Äôt like standing out; I want to fit in (or, stay in the background) and I view myself as an average person. I like to say that if everyone is unique that means no one is unique. 

School performance:

Good grades in art, music, history, English and religion. 
Bad grades in maths, science and social studies. 
I have been very unproductive in school, slacked a lot and missed a lot of assignments. 


INFP vs ISTJ: 

In favour of INFP: 

I‚Äôm so called ‚Äúcreative‚Äù, since I write, play music and occasionally draw. I‚Äôm unproductive and I like to fantasise and make up internal worlds. I prefer dreams over reality. I‚Äôm somewhat ‚Äúbohemian‚Äù. 

In favour of ISTJ:

Detail oriented, rather cold, not very cheerful or ‚Äúcute‚Äù, not very politically liberal as most INFPs appear to be. Private; not open about my feelings. Appreciates the past. Dresses classically and conservatively. No desire for adventure; I stick to what works for me and what makes me comfortable. 


I don‚Äôt think I have neither Te nor Ne. What do you think, am I INFP or ISTJ? I notice when writing this that it didn‚Äôt end up as clear and concrete as it did in my mind. Again, if you have good questions I‚Äôll gladly answer them to help shed some light on the situation.",1594221901
ISTJ,"For example, as a Ti user, when I look at a clock, I narrate in my head ""that is an analogue clock, with clear markings of its seconds, the font (of the numbers) looks like a serif""

[Wait that kind of example won't work because I'm basically just describing an object and that won't explain how your Si Te work or maybe I should write down the narration when I'm about to do something instead of just doing an observation. But wait what I'm writing down is basically what my thoughts are and maybe I should just change the title to 'What are your thoughts like?' but eh whatever, that previous one will do anyway.]

Tldr; what thoughts cross your mind as you're reading this post? Can you please write it down as raw as I have in the above example? I really wanna know what your Si Te thought process is like. I think my Ti Ne are pretty clearly shown in mine.",1594221106
ISTJ,"For reference, I'm a 19 y/o female ISFJ. I'm pretty close with my grandparents who have, thankfully, been able to be a part of my life for so long. However, right now my grandmother is entering the final stages of congestive heart failure (CHF). It's difficult for the whole family, but especially my grandfather (who is a classic ISTJ). They have been married for 57 years. I don't think he has completely accepted the stage that my grandmother is at. He's very worried about her and is always doing research to find potential treatments they could try. He's not obsessive or anything, but I'm concerned for him and for what he will be like after she passes. I've never lost a grandparent or anyone close to me. I want to help or to have some idea of how I can help once she passes, but I really don't know what to do.

We have this kind of troll dynamic, where we would make fun of each other... and anything that serious or feely type is avoided because it's weird. How can I talk to him more and have a better relationship?",1594185340

I would LOVE to bring someone else, but I refuse to isolate myself or sit inside because I have no friends.

ISTJ,"Hi guys, I hope you check my newly-created subreddit named [r/apprenticeguild](https://www.reddit.com/r/apprenticeguild/).. I'm currently looking for new active members.

Basically my goal is to have masters and apprentices in my sub. The master will be teaching their chosen apprentice so that the apprentice can finish the goal, which is to create something related to what the master have taught them. As a master, you will be the one to specify what you're going to teach, how long the apprenticeship will be (1 day, 1 week, 2 weeks, depends on you) and what you want the apprentice to create. Then you'll guide him and answer his questions daily. You can discuss like a normal teacher would, but it's not required. Minimal guidance is fine as long as the apprentice is learning and is getting motivated to do something.

As a master you can teach anything, and you don't have to be very great at it. You just have to be able to teach something nice to another member. You can also apply to be an apprentice if you want to learn new stuff.

My motivation:

I created [r/apprenticeguild](https://www.reddit.com/r/apprenticeguild/) for a lot of reasons. I would like others to be encouraged to learn new things, experience doing something outright so that they'll know what to expect in a given field (like how hard it is to do art, for example), and be able to learn faster with the help of other people who are more skilled than them. I also think that not a lot of people have role models that they can learn from directly, so it would be nice to have a master even just a few days. It would also be a great way to find new and possible long-time friends/mentors in the future! I also think that it will help masters gain an experience in teaching, which is always a good skill to have.

Yeah, that's it. I hope you like the concept of the sub and if ever you don't want to be a master/apprentice, you can always join as an onlooker. Feel free to post any progress pics you have on whatever you're currently learning.",1594118149

ISTJ,"I can‚Äôt work out if a ISTJ female colleague is warming up to me in a potential romantic sense?

Here‚Äôs the story so far:

&amp;#x200B;

* We‚Äôve been meeting up every few weeks for knowledge sharing sessions at work. This came about as I was looking for someone in an alternative team to learn and share knowledge from (I sent out the message to different teams and managers, and her manager said she‚Äôd like to do it).

&amp;#x200B;

* We‚Äôre in different departments and teams so we don‚Äôt work directly with each other

&amp;#x200B;

* Initially the sessions were very business-like and focused on work (notably, and out of the blue (it wasn‚Äôt like I was flirting), the ISTJ mentioned to me, she didn‚Äôt want to mix work and personal life, as she‚Äôd dated co-workers before and it didn‚Äôt end well)

&amp;#x200B;

* The intro session was very clinical in it‚Äôs vibe

&amp;#x200B;

* This was fine from me, as I wanted a similar focus for the sessions, albeit perhaps not so ‚Äòclinical‚Äô

&amp;#x200B;

* However, gradually over time, we got chatting in the knowledge sessions and the ‚Äòbusiness-like‚Äô nature she had at the beginning began to fade away bit by bit

&amp;#x200B;

* It seems we‚Äôve got a lot in common - similar interests, humour, outlook on life and how we generally approach things.

&amp;#x200B;

* She suggested extending our knowledge sessions for a longer duration, and also wanted our sessions to have time dedicated to chatting about informal things

&amp;#x200B;

* Our sessions (which have been going on for 4+ months) now often involve loads of conversation often about non-work things i.e. hobbies, previous work experience, life/career goals, where we grew up etc

&amp;#x200B;

* She also began to reveal more personal info about herself i.e. mentioned living with an ex-boyfriend, had a bad ending to her previous job, her family life, info that I thought seemed to ‚Äòbreak‚Äô her previous position as not trying to mix work and play

&amp;#x200B;

* She also remarked that she felt we were similar personalities and was very appreciate of how considerate and thoughtful I was in managing the sessions. She‚Äôs also started asking for my opinion and help on things for her stuff at work

&amp;#x200B;

* It‚Äôs also got to a point where our conversations in these sessions feel very natural. We share knowledge, make fun of each other, talk shit, speak about our opinions on current affairs etc

&amp;#x200B;

* From what I‚Äôve inferred from what‚Äôs she said, it doesn‚Äôt seem like she‚Äôs seeing anyone (in lockdown, exclusively hanging out with her flatmate and there‚Äôs been no hint of a boyfriend or anything like that)

I‚Äôd like to see if there‚Äôs any potential romantic feelings there or at least explore the idea i.e. asking her to spend time outside of work with me, but I‚Äôm not sure about the best way to approach it?

Or is it best if I wait for her to start indicating signs of romantic interest in our conversations? I suppose she set her boundaries right at the start i.e. not mixing work and personal life - albeit they are ones that have broken down somewhat between us.

However she's mentioned she‚Äôs quite introverted, and aren‚Äôt ISTJ‚Äôs quite reserved when it comes to taking the initiative and appreciate when someone is being direct - especially when it comes to romance?

ISTJ,"Let me first say that this post is not intended to be a 'humble brag' or anything like that. I have what I have, I don't really care to impress others or what they think.

Ok, on to the point of the post. As I get older (mid thirties) I find that I need more and more status and income. I need more power in my career. A big part of this is supporting my family. My wife doesn't work and stays home with our children. We have a comfortable life. New cars, good sized house, etc. 

In the past year I've doubled my income by leaving the job that I was at for ten years and then by leaving this new job two years later for another new job.

I just took a promotion that will will move me up the ladder to a 'director' position. Now that I have this new title I can switch companies in a year or two and most likely double my income through a vice presidency role. After that would be COO and eventually CEO.

Here's the thing... I feel like I can't stop myself. I'm torn. A big part of me wants the responsibility and status of these jobs. But, as I move up there is a significant amount of stress and worry. I want to support my family but I'm also somewhat afraid that I won't stop until I hit one of these high level positions.

I'm very mixed about all of this. Is it worth it? I do enjoy the work...but do I want the extra stress and responsibility? To top it all off I run a small business on the side that is taking up more and more of my time. This business has been a six year project and is bringing in another fulll time income... but after the full time job and the small business I feel there is no time left for any hobbies.

ISTJ,"So, recently I got typed by a guy on YouTube and he said I was an ISTJ, no debate. To be fair, it was one of the things I was considering. But the more I looked into it, the less I really related to it. So, the basis for his typing was that I have a detailed recall of past events and am able to understand and make procedures. Ok, that seems reasonable. 

So, I definitely don‚Äôt understand myself as being a feeling type, as emotions are largely irrelevant to my decision making (I mean everyone has emotions to some extent or another). Also, I‚Äôm likely not to be an intuitive since I‚Äôm pretty grounded and practical in my behavior, don‚Äôt skip meals and exercise regularly. I‚Äôm more likely to be an introvert than an extrovert, as I share selectively what‚Äôs going on in my head and am not necessarily talkative around people I don‚Äôt know particularly well (I mean I could be extroverted but ...).

But here comes the tough part. Maybe I have a stereotyped notion of what Si as a first or second function is. But don‚Äôt care for, nor have I ever for traditions, duty, discipline, established operating procedures, or such matters. The idea of doing something just because it‚Äôs been done before doesn‚Äôt really seem valid since there are other ways that haven‚Äôt been tried that may be just as valid. Also, I‚Äôm really lacking in focus and discipline; probably have a case of ADD. I don‚Äôt actually stick to any plans I make and often fail to get stuff done by the due date for school and such.

I am an ENFP (enneagram type 4). I recently started dating an ISTJ (enneagram type 1). In the beginning, he was idealizing me a lot. He would admire me for the smallest things but after a couple of months I noticed that he often criticizes me or says hurtful truths about me. He would say things like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand why people ask you questions when you have no knowledge on the subject. They should ask me.‚Äù It‚Äôs not because I think or claim to be smarter than him but it‚Äôs hurtful especially when it‚Äôs a subject that I‚Äôm passionate about. I know he doesn‚Äôt intend to be rude but it‚Äôs really hurtful.

One day when I was upset with him, and I was avoiding him for some time because I need space when I‚Äôm upset. So he contacted my friend. He texted her saying things like ‚Äúyou‚Äôre so much calmer than her. She‚Äôs like the auntie nobody listens to and you‚Äôre the one who makes everyone listen and shut up.‚Äù  

When I read that it upset me a lot. He also texted her other things where he asked her to calm me down and that he cared for me - but I can‚Äôt stop thinking if he likes her. I feel extra insecure after reading that on top of the daily criticism that comes either in the form of jokes or serious. I‚Äôm afraid I would never feel comfortable with him talking to girls but I don‚Äôt wanna be toxic.

I've taken several ISTJ career quizzes and they all lean towards budget analyst, accounting, financial analyst, etc. All very excel/numbers driven which is actually what my job is anyways. 

All that mentioned, are there any careers that offer something in a more visual capacity? I think in an ideal world I'd be some amazing interior designer who's designing homes all over the world or even real estate development. But then I look at ISTJ personality trait and they all tend to call out that event management/design things tend to bring a lot of frustration to the ISTJ due to the last minute changes and unpredictability.

ISTJ,"This is going to be slightly longer post so bear with me please. I met this man a year and a half ago, more specifically he found me on facebook and we started talking. He made an impression on me right away. He was sweet and kind and somewhat lost. He was very vulnerable and I could tell very hurt. We enjoyed our time a great deal, we used to talk non stop. Then he got hurt (military) and I stuck with him, trying to be as supportive as possible and checking on him every other day. Since then he became distant and conversations decreased a great deal. After that he had some not so nice moment with me when he disrespected me and I called him out on that, we fought and shortly after we quit talking altogether, he somewhat ghosted me. A few months passed and he reappeared out of the blue, requesting a video call,  which I declined for the absence of well known general etiquette and manners, that you dont disappear and reappear whenever you please. A few months later I had some weird dreams and decided to check on him, just to make sure he was alright. By that time I was certain I was over him and just wanted to be friends. We started talking and I realized I wanted more than a friendship. Then he opened up that he's married, after thinking thru everything I came ro conclusion that he was married by the time we first started talking. Now it gets weird, he doesn't open up about his family life but I can tell he's not happy. Its been a few months we are talking on a regular basis and we have had 2 video calls so far. Little while ago he took interest in my dating life and what I do, if I'm dating anyone or not. Next interaction - he opened up about how much he misses me and if I miss him as well and insisted on knowing about it. Then he said we need to schedule a meeting which I agreed. A week ago we had an argument, about something that hurt me and some pretty harsh words have been spoken from my side. The thing is, the whole situation lacks clarity, he doesn't tell me what he thinks or what exactly he wants from us. In order for me to proceed I need to clarify everything, I need to know exactly where I stand and what is expected of me. He doesn't give it to me, he listens but avoids clarifications. Today in our short conversation he told me if he didn't care he would let me know and to stop assuming.

Please all istjs on here, help me figure out what is that he wants from me. How do I deal with this situation? I don't want to lose him and I'm not going anywhere, but I need to have some idea as to what's going on. Tho I made my intentions clear, that I want it all with him.",1592955956

A quarter-life crisis is far more common that you‚Äôd think. Almost 75% of 25-33 year olds go through tons of stress and anxiety about understanding who they really are.

ISTJ,"Hi guys!

Popping in from the ENFP universe. I tend to get along really well with istjs. My best friend, Dad, and SO are all ISTJs oddly enough. 

So one thing I‚Äôve noticed is that communication is sometimes spot on, and sometimes it‚Äôs completely non-existent.

Like my best friend will very clearly and nicely tell me when she doesn‚Äôt want to talk, isn‚Äôt in a good mood, doesn‚Äôt want to affect me with any negative energy, or wants to establish a boundary. My dad is the same way. If he‚Äôs busy and I come to talk, he nicely tells me he‚Äôs busy. He tells me when he‚Äôs not interested in a topic in a conversation. Honestly the communication is great. 

However, when it comes to emotions, I feel like they‚Äôre not as communicative, especially my SO. If any of them are annoyed with me, they tend to be passive aggressive and make me draw it out of them (which makes me feel pushy and tired). Does anyone know why they do this? I feel like I spend a lot of time trying to read them so that I can tell when they‚Äôre in a bad mood so I can help them work through it, otherwise I end up getting passive aggressiveness and the silent treatment, when I don‚Äôt even know what‚Äôs wrong.",1592779301

Meanwhile the football jock fresh out of high school who sat behind me barely did the work.

I'm asking because I have been on really good dates with this ISTJ guy for about two months now. We meet up for food/outdoor activities (covid activities) every week. We've so far gone on a walk around the lake, gone hiking, eaten on the bench outside a really cool scenery, etc. He initiates all the plans and keeps in contact. I show equal amount of interest (because I actually find him to be really stinking cute and awesome!).

In my experience, all my past boyfriends have asked me to be their girlfriend within 3 dates. I'm an intuitive myself, so it is easy to know when I want to be with someone long-term, and prefer a pretty quick ""ask out, get together."" 

I've read in this subreddit that ISTJs are fact gatherers... and safe players in most aspects of life.

Or
- realists who try to keep their expectation as down to earth as possible?

\- He's cheap and saving, typically buys kids what they want while bragging that other dads aren't as selfless as him.

\- He seeks sympathy like talking about how he's the only one supporting our family.

\- He hates seeing our family get into fights but isn't afraid to confront strangers.

\- Organized but also messy when cleaning.

\- Angry and violent. Grandparents warned my mom that he has anger issues.

I am good at coding, but I don't like it so I thought maybe I don't have to do it.

So it is very and very difficult for me to get out of this box. I don't have motivation, because I don't need much money, girls and experience, my goal now is to live a quite life where I do the things I like. 

I also really am not satisfied with that I am not so good at researching as Se and Ne users especially.I just don't see the sense in it.

ISTJ,"So I just took the 16Personalities test and my results gave me ISTJ, so here I am with a problem (or two) I was hoping others here could relate to and share some strategies/fixes for these issues.

My first issue, and I kind of hate talking on the phone. I get lethargic very quickly when talking on the phone and this has manifested more problems for me. I moved a few states away from most of my family for educational reasons and I do a terrible job calling/keeping up with them. I love and care about them but to be honest when they (or anybody in my life) is out of sight, they are out of mind too. So before I know it, a month has passed and I haven't spoken to family members who take this very personally. In dating, I've messed up several situations because after sex I forget (or 100% honestly, can't be bothered) to call back or check up. 

My second issue is selfishness. I am an introspective person and I can admit it's always my first instinct to get what I want/put myself first. Sometimes I'll do this with the wrong people and they'll get the impression I only care about myself, and this isn't a beneficial perception for others to have of me. This branches into other problems like lack of patience, I get very pissed off at people who've done alot for me over relatively small stuff, etc.

So for my ISTJ's who share these problems, any advice? These issues are constantly getting me into trouble with people I care about and otherwise. Thanks.",1591935694

2. I've heard that ISTJs are lazy... While also being described as very clean, organized, and hard working. 
3. Why are there such contrasting stereotypes on ISTJs? Boring and quirky... Lazy and hard working...

When I was researching cognitive functions, I thought that ISTJ related to me most, but now I'm not so sure. I don't find myself being skeptical of things.

I'm an INTJ in a long term relationship with an ISTJ.

ISTJ," Hi all,

I posted the same thing on INTJ thread but I'd like to hear from ISTJ too. I've been having a hard time figuring out my type. I've done online tests a few years ago and I got ISTJ but those description didn't come like ""Yeah, that's exactly me!"" Like the half of the description could relate to me but I was like ""But I don't think I'm that inflexible."" These days I constantly score INTJ but I don't know if that's correct or I'm just unconsciously trying to score INTJ.

Recently I started to study cognitive functions of mbti online by reading articles or watching videos rather than relying on general characteristics that could to some extent apply to anyone like ""ISTJs value pasts blah blah blah.."", but since all mbti theories are kinda general and abstract, I'm still having a hard time figuring our which my dominant function is and which my inferior function is. (Ni vs Si, Se vs Ne)

To give you a context, since my family relationship was chaotic and toxic and I was raised by my mom who is emotionally unhealthy and stubborn and liked to organize everything to the perfection(ISTJ or any Si heavy user?), I grew up being suppressed and stressed in my teenage, I acted more like a lonewolf ISTJ who doesn't commit much to communities and be kind of selfish but on a personal level, I was a careful, thoughtful and serious boy who could put a lot of effort to pick up details and info to achieve my goal and was traumatically and melancholically trapped by the past. I didn't have a grand long future plan like 10 years later but have always had some goals or ambition to get better at something I worked on. Kinda sounds like a mix of ISTJ and INTJ eh?

Recently, I left from my parents and noticed that if I'm given room to do freely as I want, I grow more and more, and my goals get bigger and more future oriented. I am now more into thriving to create a better future for my own and going for personal goals rather than securing myself from incoming stresses and risks, and much more ambitious and intuitive.

These are some of my traits for both types.

ISTJ

¬∑ I notice lots of details but only on subjects I am interested or trying to study. I sort them out in my mind.

¬∑ I have memories for several events and moments that was important or impressional to me, but not sure if it's as good as ""good memory"" referred often as ISTJ trait.

¬∑ I have strong sense of loyalty to those who cared about me and I owe to.

¬∑ My hobby is music and hookah. I have very sensitive sensors and can notice small details for these. I cannot stand loud or crowded places like a club.

¬∑ I was raised to be pragmatic and have never felt very conscious of my intuition of hunches and let them do the work until these few months after I was freed from the chain from my parents and past trauma.

¬∑ I stick to authority and proven methods if I think they work the best, otherwise I don't. 

 

INTJ

¬∑ I always have goals for myself and ambition, and do not value communities or tradition or rules that don't make sense to me. I don't plan 10 years ahead but have an image of a few years later of what I want to be. I'm always thinking ahead and true meanings behind things.

¬∑ I do not hate changes. Changes and chaos are potentials.

¬∑ I do not have sense of loyalty to tradition or communities and rules just for the sake of tradition or rules unless they are meaningful to me. Anything that can be improved should be changed. I was often thought to be antisocial and rebellious because I didn't agree with what others said. I thought they didn't make sense.

¬∑I have strong sense of honor and loyalty to myself and to a few who are very important to me, but if they corrupt into something that goes too much against my sense of honor and moral, I leave from them, even best friends. I'm like ""Idk what you think or how you react but I'm doing this anyway for the sake of my honor.""

¬∑ Contrary to my sensitive sensors, sometimes I also seem to have inferior Se. I'm not good at physical activities and my motions are slow, and I push myself to the extent that I got insomnia and depression before realizing how stressed I was. I do not overindulge myself to alcohol or food tho.

¬∑ I can see how things will go. People are often surprised when I could read their mind.

Recently I'm starting to kind of get the sense of ""intuition"" or ""hunches"". They are still not crystal clear but Ni dom is starting to make sense to me. I'm still not sure if I'm Si dom or Ni dom tho. Now I'm starting to realize the sense of Ni dom after studying functions but have never been conscious of it so in the past, Ni description didn't make much sense to me.

Does my childhood confuse my typing? From the point of view of dominant and inferior function, how can you explain my traits and which one can you type me as? Do you think I'm an ISTJ with developed Ni or an unhealthy INTJ who's been suppressed and couldn't have worked properly? I personally feel like I was forced to act like Si dom because of my childhood and influence from my mom but these days my Ni is starting to freely work without restrictions. I also think it's easier to answer pragmatically on online tests because questions are too general and ambiguous, which could be a reason I first typed as ISTJ.

Please feel free to throw me questions ""what if"" or ""how do you behave when"" things like that.

Btw, I'm never professionally tested. It's very rare and expensive in my country. That's why I seek for opinions from the community.

ISTJ,"I know a lot of other ISTJs have similar traits. I'm extremely picky with friends. I only keep close friends and acquaintances.

It's an issue for me in the workplace because I never want to get too close to any of my coworkers that I wouldn't naturally be friends with. Should this be something I just suck up and fake?

ISTJ,"Hi,

I'm an INTJ male and my ex is an ISTJ female. We dated on and off for the past 10 years where we also had other romantic interests in between. I'll get straight to the point. She's engaged and the last time we spoke she told me that it was going to be the very last time we'll ever speak to each other because she doesn't want to ruin what she has with her fiance. I respect that but only to an extent.

We live in different states so every time we heard about an issue in the other person's city, we email that person (phone numbers blocked) just to make sure that person is okay. I understand why I do it because I will always love her. I don't understand why she does it to me. The last time I heard about a natural disaster near her city, I emailed her just to make sure she's okay. As expected, she called me, angry, and told me that I needed to stop reaching out to her. I didn't care. Just knowing that she's alive was enough for me.

Fast forward to today. There's a lot of riot happening right now and my city is known for one of the worse BLM riots in the nation. She knows I'm pro BLM and tonight I received a random text from her, ""Please be safe #BLM"". After the last time she called me, upset about me reaching out to her, why would she text me? She was so adamant about not being a part of each other's lives anymore, I just don't get why I got the text?

Any kind of response is appreciated. If this will generate more insight, I love ISTJs. If you are like her, you deserve the world.",1591078779
ISTJ,"So I already posted this on /r/intj but thought I would get some valuable answers here as well. Here goes...

""ISTJs have inferior Extraverted Intuition (Ne). They tend to be skeptical of ‚Äúhunches‚Äù, theoretical, unproven facts, or experimenting with new approaches to something they already know how to do through experience.

INTJs have inferior Extraverted Sensing (Se). They tend to be skeptical of their sense-impressions, other people‚Äôs personal experience, and they prefer to live in the future rather than focusing on the moment.""

These are two paragraphs from an article I've been reading, and I thought this showed a lot of the problems I've been having typing myself. The rest of the article is very similar to this in that I connect equally with both sides and don't have a clear-cut way of telling whether or not one is more prominent than the other.

So, just as an example, I'll break down these two paragraphs. If anyone else reads the article and would like me to share more of my double-sided problem, I'd be happy to do that in the comments, but right now I'd just like to hear people's opinions on this.

So, I am skeptical of ""hunches"" and theoretical, unproven facts. However, experimenting with new approaches to something I already know how to do is amazing and I love seeing the different outcomes, especially in subjects I am deeply interested in.

As for the second paragraph, I'm still skeptical of my sense-impressions, other people's personal experience, and I prefer to live in the future rather than the moment.

I would like to add a couple of things as well. I still may look at or create theories of my own and have hunches, but I am ALWAYS skeptical of them. They need to be proven to be true. But the same thing goes for senses. The only way to determine if something is exactly that way is through exact measurements and recording it. Others' personal experiences are very unreliable, and need to be put to the test. Also, I love living in the future and even creating stories in my head about the way things *could* be, even if it's not even slightly realistic. But I also love looking back at my past experiences and can dwell on that nearly as much as the future. And all of my future dreams are based on the way things have worked in the past and how I would like them to change. One thing is certain--I hate living in the moment, and it's nearly impossible for me. I get way too caught up in my own thoughts for that. It seems like I'm split exactly down the middle with each type, even after looking at functions. It could be either one, and I can't narrow it down any further with my own knowledge. I did briefly consider that I could be an INFJ, but upon researching the functions, it became obvious that this wasn't true. Now all I have left is INTJ vs ISTJ, and it is extremely unclear. Any help would be appreciated!

I forgot to mention that I don't do well with tradition at all. I much prefer taking a new approach over something else that most people would do because it ""has always been that way"". But at the same time, I like stability and enjoy knowing what to expect depending on the situation. For example, I wear the same thing and eat the same things every day. But family traditions, manners, and many other things that are considered the norm and ""the way they have always been done"" are just not for me. So that's another tidbit if that would help answering my question any better I guess.

But after that, I noticed I had started to become more angry and controlling every day. I easily get angry at people who spread misinformation about the virus (especially since I'm a medical biology major), people who don't follow quarantine rules, people who don't practice proper hygiene (e.g. washing their hands properly and covering their noses/mouths when sneezing), and people too privileged or ignorant to know the current events in this world. Also, if you know what I mean, there are OTHER negative things happening in the world right now that adds up to the stress and overthinking. I find it hard to sleep lately. I'm not really the type to remain apathetic when I see a solution in things I care about that is why I have several questions about this below.

ISTJ,"Hi! Just an ENFP (F 20) here with yet another question about a potential ISTJ (M 23). Sorry if this is super long but Ive asked all my friends for advice on this situation and they understandably think Im crazy and have no interest in it anymore. 

So I work with and now have a crush on this guy who I think is most likely an ISTJ. He is extremely driven and focused, he dosen't talk much about non work related topics while at work and is very hard to distract. He is awkward and quiet around most people except the two guys he is closest to and regularly spends time with outside of work. He is hard to get to know, rarely gives out compliments and is sometimes just straight up blunt and harsh with his comments. My first question is what can I look for or observe or what questions can I ask myself about him that will make me sure he is an ISTJ? 

My second question comes in two parts, 1) does he like me as more than a friend or even at all? 2) should I make it known to him that I like him? will that change anything or is he just so focused on the fact that we work together and need to maintain a ""professional"" relationship that he will never take it further, even if he is attracted to me?

I am getting some signs that he may be interested but there is some background to cover first. So I work in a very casual environment. It's a fast food place and its mostly just young people in part time jobs who come through and leave again very quickly. Lots of flirting and hooking up happens and its not really frowned upon. There are lots of couples who work there together now and some who have met there in the past that have now moved on to other jobs. He has apparently hooked up with another girl who we mutually work with before, but it never worked out between them, so I don't think he's 100% against workplace relationships. But I never got the full story and I can't be sure who made the first move. I'm thinking if it was him then he would have done that same thing with me and it means he's just not interested but she's very confident and outgoing and it could have very easily been her so idk.

As for some of the signs I notice which make me think it's not all in my head. 

In the beginning, he would hardly speak to me. As an ENFP, I have a pretty bad self image and don't think extremely highly of myself. I like to interact playfully with people who I feel welcomed to do so by, otherwise I fear rejection for being too loud or too much to handle because I've experienced that in the past. He would interact with other people pretty irregularly and briefly and mostly focus on work, but he would just ignore me completely, and so because I didn't feel that warmth or feel invited into his close personal space, I didn't want to cross that boundary uninvited so just never really spoke to him either. We were both very quiet and awkward around eachother, avoiding eye contact or conversation. But it always felt to me almost more like the tension of something left unsaid or undone, that wanted to be said or done, rather than a genuine disliking of or lack of interest in talking to me. I've seen from reading lots of ISTJ posts that this is common when you like someone. You can't look them in the eye or talk to them, for fear of saying the wrong thing and looking like a fool. I always felt instinctively that it was more nerves for him with me rather than dislike. 

Any of the girls who have boyfriends he's much more comfortable and playful with. It's almost more like he's flirting with them than he is with the girls he could actually be with. He's so quiet and withdrawn with single girls, me especially, that when he is friendly with other girls its seen as flirting, but I think hes just so comfortable with knowing that they already have boyfriends so he can be more himself around them. Its funny because the girl he apparently already hooked up with and so is obviously attracted to, he is as nervous and quiet and awkward around her as he is with me. He treats me like the girl he hooked up with even though we never have and treats the girls with boyfriends like he's flirting with them. But its hard to tell because the girl who has a boyfriend who hes very comfortable around who everyone thinks hes flirting with, is really very pretty, so it may just be that he doesn't care she has a boyfriend and is flirthing with her anyway and really is just ignoring me and is not nervous at all. There's so many ways his brain could be working its so hard to figure out! 

Anyway, once this silence built up to an unbearably uncomfortable point, for me anyway, I started to ask silly questions just to talk about something/anything so it wasn't so awkward. Now we talk in chit chat sometimes at work in groups but when we're alone at work or at work parties we talk about more normal things and have longer conversations. His parents are divorced and he talks about his dad to me, not deep or emotional things but just generally what his dad is doing with him or for him currently, which I don't hear him speak about to other people. He doesn't really ask me about myself which makes me feel like he doesn't care but he always seems to answer my questions openly and without annoyance or feeling intruded upon. I feel like I'm allowed to ask questions now and distract him a little more from his work than other people can or even than I could before.

He jokes around with me now, and I don't see him do it with anyone else. Maybe as an ENFP, I'm just so busy daydreaming I don't notice it but I think it's different with me. He'll make a joke but say it kind of nervously and then laugh after, like he's nervous or he dosen't know if we're quite there yet, or if I feel comfortable enough around him for him to joke with me. For example, one time someone came to visit me at the place we work and he hadn't really spoken to anyone all day, me included, and just came over and told me someone was here to see me and then joked ""it's the cops"". That seems small for someone else but he is never silly like this and because he was this one time and it was so out of character for him I was kind of in shock. Another time we were at a party and I was taking a photo which he was in and I didn't like how I looked in it so I deleted it and made some comment about myself like ""ew thats gross"", and he said ""wow do I look that bad"" almost as if he wasnt trying to get me to compliment him.

He will sometimes iniate conversation with me over little silly things. He will come to me with some gadget or packaging we mutually use for work and just said ""ohmygod dont you just hate these theyre so annoying"" when he hasnt spoken to me or really anyone all day so far. Its so out of the blue I end up kinda going ""uhhhm yeah I guess"" and the conversation fizzles out and then I feel bad.

I arrived to a work party one time late and everyone was already there. I had to walk down steps to get to them in a dress, picture prom style dramatic, and there was a group of about 5 out of the 40-50 or so in attendance standing outside smoking, and he was one of them. They all looked up at me and said nothing, except for him who specifically shouted up to me"" hi (myname)"". I was also leaving work one day and as I was walking out the door with my back turned not even paying attention he shouted back to me ""bye (myname)"" from down the corrider about 8feet. 

He also complimented me one time on a job I did really well. I was trying to sell something to a customer and he said it was ""so good he almost fell for it himself"". That was so out of character for him and hasnt happened since but I literally had to go to the bathroom and scream at this. 

Twice in the whole year I've worked there I've felt a gentle touch on my lower back as someone was passing like to move me out of the way and turned around to find him being the only person in close range. The only other boys who have done this to me from work have made an effort to make contact with me on social media at some point before or afterwards or just straight up asked me out. The ones with girlfriends or who are much older or who just don't seem interested never touch me like this. I've broken the touch barrier with him multiple times and he doesn't flinch or move away. He passes by me super closesly and definitely doesn't leave any room for jesus. 

He appears where I am. It's a small vicinity to be fair but whatever station I'm working at he seems to be helping on that station. He helps me pack food into bags when I don't need it. He washes utensils for me and brings them back and then just goes and does something else without washing anything for anyone else near me. Or he empties and replaces the trash can where I am and not any where else. He is in a higher more managerial position than me so this confuses me cause it's kinda just his job but he seems to always apply his managing more to where I am. 

Basically, I could contemplate if his ""flirting"" with the girls who have boyfriends is just his way of saying"" Im comfortable being friendly with you now"" and his awkwardness around me is his actual flirting, or vice versa, but I'd just love to hear the opinion of an actual ISTJ. I want to get inside your head and know how you think. I can't recall all the little details or physically recreate the odd feeling that I get when he does something seemingly normal in a certain way that makes it seem like it means more than surface level, but its there. 

Id also like to add, so milenial of me, but I have swiped right on him on tinder and gotten no match, and sent him a general snapchat which I did send to some of my friends also, but was the first point of contact we'd ever had not in person at work or a work related party or event and gotten no response. Is it that if an ISTJ was interested in me he would be so nervous and/or obvlivious as to not respond to communication like that? Or maybe dosen't want to ruin the professionalism of our work relationship even though hes crossed that boundary before? Or does that mean hes just definitely not interested? 

I know you guys dont tend to make the first move but would you swipe on tinder on someone you knew personally before/worked with? or would you ignore a snapchat of someone you liked if it was general and not direct personal communication? 
I get all these signs in person and at work, but no communication or effort outside of that besides watching all my stories. I am utterly confused and definitely not more confident of one way rather than the other, although I try to automatically default to ""he just wants to be a friendly colleague so you can work together"" to spare myself the dissapointment when that ultimately turns out to be true. I also get self concious about how much I talk or ask him questions or how loud I am and sometimes wonder if he even likes me at all, even as a person. I would hate to think my crush on him is clouding my judgment and turning his every move into him somehow liking me back. Generally when someone ignores you this much you automatically presume they aren't interested but you ISTJ's are different, so tell me, what do you think?",1590719899

No, it's not our responsibility what so ever, to maintain anything 

I think it's a waste of time to do so, when you'll hardly get anything of value in return, and obviously those ppl are bringing it on themselves, they deserve it 

Take infps for ex, my exes and my mother are all infps, and flat out, they're childish, and very self absorbed to the point they literally de attached from reality, so you can't rely on them when you actually need reliability.. 

I tore muscles so badly, I couldn't walk, I sat in the ER.. Mother comes incredibly angry, telling me to get the f up, starts spouting her usual vulgar insults loud just because she didn't wanna be there, leaves 5 mins later.. too self absorbed in her own world.. You've got no clue how much I've done for this woman

This scenario kept repeating over and over, even with my exes, I'd give so much and get so little if anything.. I'd get hurt the most... 

With intps it's a similar scenario, like my sister and few of my exes.. They feel sorry for themselves, and get so touchy if they're not held on a pedestal.. They see ppl as either smart or stupid, and they see themselves as the smartest there is.. If things don't go their way they blame everyone but themselves.. They're your typical narcissist.. Which is so incredibly fake 

They're fucking crazy okay, at least infps can have some conscious after they snap out, intps are nuts they still think they're entitled even if they're wrong, it can escalate to physical assault if they see justified.. I literally had to get a restraining order man

So on and so on, 

Listen, I don't know if I've been across only unhealthy types, but these patterns keep repeating over and over..

Istjs are not responsible for anyone's insanity okay? I only felt sane when I stopped giving a shit or fixing shit, I just removed myself, because these ppl don't deserve it. Things will break down, and unless there's reliable value in return from ppl, I don't think there's point in doing anything even if we can

I lost the ability to look at something and extract facts from a situation without getting lost in all the attached emotions. I want to go back to being subjective. My head is always a foggy place for some reason and my heart is always too loud. It's irritating that I can no longer see as clearly as I used to. I never dove into my feelings or talked about them in real life (often very embarrassed by them and I still am) but it's all I could talk about online. I feel like I lost control of myself and I don't know what to do.",1590297355

ISTJ,"Okay, I want to start this post off by saying: I love taking personality tests like the mbti ones and looking at stuff online bc I love to feel like a part of something, but I also don‚Äôt like taking them because I don‚Äôt feel that I know myself and am answering the questions accurately.  I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm answering them the way I ‚Äòwant to be‚Äô instead of the way I actually am, and also I don‚Äôt have the most social experience [am 18]  as I‚Äôm kinda a loner so some of the questions are tough to really *know* what I‚Äôd do in certain social situations.

Overall though it‚Äôs still fun investigating the different types and looking up types for fictional characters and getting people to take the test irl, but there‚Äôs one thing about my own type (at least that I keep getting when I take tests) that really bothers me.  

It‚Äôs the word that comes up on like every website page in desc of istj: tradition. i like an orderly environment and knowing what to do, but I can‚Äôt stand tradition!  I question everything and *why* we‚Äôre doing what we‚Äôre doing, and I think to accept something just because it‚Äôs been this way is the worst.  I thrive with an open mindset and the idea that we can change ourselves, and nothing makes me more upset than someone thinking and acting a certain way just because they were raised to do so.  i‚Äôve always been extremely independent, and I couldn‚Äôt imagine just accepting little parts of life the way they are when you can actively do them differently.  No one ever made a name for themselves by just doing what everyone else had been doing!  And I‚Äôm definitely not thinking about it on a large-scale level, like that is so overwhelming and abysmal to me, it‚Äôs just the little things.

I really don‚Äôt want to stray too close to saying ‚Äúeveryone is sheeple!!!‚Äù because I get it, I‚Äôm just an angsty teen, and I want to acknowledge that some of the frustration I have with traditions probably come from my negative attitude about humanity in general.  But I don‚Äôt know where to draw the line between ‚Äúthese thoughts I‚Äôm having are stopping me from perceiving things realistically and being true to myself‚Äù and ‚Äúthese thoughts I‚Äôm having, which develop into my attitude, ARE part of my personality.‚Äù  So I guess I‚Äôm trying to reconcile my feelings with fitting into the ISTJ type, but I just don‚Äôt know what to think about what I think! 

I don‚Äôt know if this is gonna make much sense.  I know the last paragraph was pretty out-there but I‚Äôm too lazy to fix it (yeah it‚Äôs the one thing I won‚Äôt make perfect). This has been stewing in my head for a while but I‚Äôve never taken the time to write it out until now with quarantine, and school winding down.  If you want me to clarify something, feel free to ask, I didn‚Äôt want to get too deep into my ideas here because I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre good ones (low self esteem gang yessss) and overall this is about my general problem with tradition. Okay so my final questions are just like, do any other ISTJs feel this way?  Do you think I‚Äôm probably a different type? Do you think I‚Äôm caring way too much about a personality test that really doesn‚Äôt have to be that perfect and won‚Äôt fit everyone? (Probably.) Lemme know whatever you think. Thanks.",1590279898

ISTJ,"Hello fellow Redditers,

Hope you are in best of health and happiness. I had taken a MBTI test in 2016 Dec where I got ESFJ as result, when I took the same again around mid 2019, it turned out to be ISTJ and again on next time as well when I retook it in a few months.

When I read and explore, I find myself much closer to ISTJ personality type like being organized, straight forward, interested in real world things instead of abstract ideas, valuing tried and tested methods etc. while a couple of ESFJ traits fit as well like being a giver etc.

Wanted to know is it usual to feel having a few non prominent traits, if so what could be the effects of same.",1590058031
ISTJ,"Obviously in the time of corona, employment is on the minds of a lot of people. I am 26 years old and have been participating in the ""gig economy"" since I was 18 in the area of concert production and touring. I've had a distant goal of working for an orchestra for a while now but since I started out in the nightclub scene, the transition has been slow moving to say the least.

Since I entered the workforce I've had an aversion to the ""permanent job."" I was so used to having contracts that had a definitive set of goals, clear and instantaneously very real markers as it related to accomplishing or failing the set goals (it would be like making an error on a class presentation except there's 10,000 people watching and lots of pyro involved), a start date, and an end date. I never had to quit anything because the job would come to an end naturally. I'd get put on a team and fulfill my function while in the process keeping an eye out for whatever the next opportunity could be. This was also good for me because I thought my attention span was still only about the length of your typical college semester which was usually the longest these gigs lasted. In any given year I'd usually have 2-4 jobs, never getting bored, and always learning new things. The only downside was that the pay was always up in the air and there were never any sort of medical/dental/financial benefits. This occurred to me as I was approaching 26 and realized that soon my healthcare situation would be less than ideal.

In the one permanent job I did accept, I found myself burning out in 8 months. Even though it was at a music venue, there was no definitive end goal. It was just a calendar of shows that went on and on and on and would keep going on every single night until I for whatever reason decided I'd want to go do something else. This idea was very daunting for me and also very monotonous. I also think I did not enjoy missing out on the most complicated parts of putting on a show: touring logistics and production development. I was on the side of giving visiting artists whatever they needed once the final product was already complete. 

However in the several months leading up to corona, I managed to get a sort of contract/permanent gig hybrid. I was signed on to manage an 11 month tour and once that was finished the company would then assign me to another tour. I was worried I'd experience the same burnout I did at the venue but I didn't. It was like I'd found shoes that finally fit right in a position that was well paid and had benefits. I was no longer living paycheck to paycheck like I had been since I was in college. Now that corona has hit and destroyed my entire industry, these things are really coming in handy.

I love amusement parks (one of the only times I am okay with being around a bunch of screaming people)

I don‚Äôt pride myself on my math skills. I am good at math but not exceptional. My strongest skill is reading.

My preferred genre of books is dark fantasy (I also love mystery/horror but those are more StEreOtYpiCaL). 

I often regret the choices I make and have a hard time letting things go.

Deep, deep, deep, deep down... I am actually a bit sensitive. I hate showing this side of myself and I hate that I can take things way too personally at times. I often have to remind myself to stop being dramatic and take a few seconds to shove all my emotions back down and remain calm.

I am both the most patient and most impatient person ever. I try to not let myself show strong emotions but it is so easy for me to get annoyed. I can have a strong poker face if I want to and no one will know what I am feeling. But most of the time, I don‚Äôt care and let my emotions show on my face.

I am indecisive in the sense that I often second guess myself and my mindset it ‚Äúsomething could always go wrong.‚Äù Even when I have thought about something thoroughly, I still feel the self doubt that makes me feel like I need to start over. I am decisive in the sense that when I know that I am right or when I know that I have discovered the most efficient way of doing something, I make up my mind and become a bit inflexible.

Not all ISTJs are unexpressive, of course, but it's ironic that some of the people who mistake unexpressive people -- people who *appear* emotionless -- as being literally emotionless are (presumably) intuitives, since intuition suggests an ability to find hidden meaning.

Don't worry about the stereotypes. All types have bunk stereotypes associated with them. Some of my best friends have been ISTJs, and I've found them to be incredibly intimate people once I've gotten to know them. It sucks that you people have to deal with this stuff.",1589864033

ISTJ,"I can't figure out my friend's type

* Looks very cold and unapproachable at first impression. She doesn't speak much and hardly initiates meeting a person first. However once you get to know her a little longer, she'll slowly begin to show her real side. She's actually a really playful, silly girl who laughs at almost everything and enjoys joking around with people. 
* She's a bit reserved and struggles with acting cute or cheesy. 
* Although it's very against the culture where she lives to the point of it being a taboo, she got many piercings and tattoos at the age of 15. She has her entire back tattooed with something she designed on her own. 
* She enjoys drawing and is very good at it. She also loves singing, writing her own songs, playing the guitar, acting, and dancing. She initially majored in art while in college before switching to some sort of communications major. 
* Her dream is to become a famous singer and she said she'll never stop chasing after her dreams and what she wants in life. 
* Extremely hard-working and focused on her goals. Her discipline is really good and she works hard to the point of tiring out her own body and getting stressed. Even then, she still tries to stop at nothing until she achieves her goals. 
* Although she looks like someone who's afraid of nothing and tough, she's not as fearless and strong as people perceive her. She admitted that she's scared that she hasn't worked hard enough, that there are things she hasn't completed perfectly, and that she has disappointed everyone who likes her by not meeting their expectations. 
* She used to barely have any friends at all because she was afraid of getting hurt and she's on the shyer side. Although she barely had friends, she always wished that she could have a lot of friends. On her birthday every year, she would feel sad, lonely, and anxious because she wouldn't have anyone who would celebrate it with her. 
* Even though she wants to have a lot of friends since she's never had many and has always been a lone-wolf type of girl, she's definitely an introvert who enjoys staying at home.
* She's pretty good at putting up a front when she's about to cry. However there are times where it's quite easy to see she's almost going to cry. Sometimes her mood flips within seconds, such as this one time where she was laughing then heard a comment. Immediately her mood flipped and you could see her lip trembling and her eyes starting to water. However the person expanded on their comment and said it was a joke then she immediately started smiling widely again. 
* She likes putting a twist on things and making them different. For example, she enjoys singing but when doing a cover of a song, she likes putting her own spin on it to make the cover a little different. 
* She claims that she's fast-paced and impatient. I don't really see it, but I suppose she could be on the impatient side. 
* She wants to bring everyone positivity and happiness. She tries to ignore anyone who dislikes her because she wants to stay happy and hopes everyone else is happy too.
* Pressure helps motivate her 
* She can enjoy compliments just like everyone else can, but what she cares most about is criticism. Once someone criticizes her, she puts all her focus on that and tries her best to improve. She can be pretty hard on herself.
* She says she's a straightforward person; however, she's more gentle depending on who the person is. For example, she's less straightforward with some of her softer friends because she's afraid she could possibly hurt their feelings, which she doesn't want to do.
* She knows how to cut hair and has spent a lot of time cutting other friends' hair too. She enjoys doing her nails and makeup. She has dyed her hair a shade of pink before and currently has burgundy hair.
* Very non-judgmental; she can be friends with anybody and doesn't care about what they do or what they like. 
* She once said something about not being the same person you originally were after going through a rainstorm, and that she hopes people can know her as someone with more possibilities.",1589756851
ISTJ,"For the first time in my life I feel so alive and comfortable around this ISTJ guy. We have been establishing our friendship and getting to know each other in a very personal way. I shared my insecurities he shared his and i trusted him completely. To me he‚Äôs a decent human being and won‚Äôt do stupid things. I respect him for that. It might sound crazy because everything is currently in long distance and we plan to meet as soon as the pandemic is in control. 

I‚Äôm an INTJ and it takes me blood and sweat to open up and accept someone into my lonely life. I see him as a potential companion to share my life journey with.   He‚Äôs been stressed recently due to the isolation of lockdown. We normally had our video calls on Friday and Saturday nights but he completely canceled it for 2 weeks. We were in no contact for 2 weeks then he messaged me again last weekend. I told him I understood his coping mechanisms with the lockdown and I was available for him if he wanted some chit chat. We exchanged the few texts then he went completely anonymous for a week and didn‚Äôt carry on our conversation on humans and society. 

My intuition tells me that he‚Äôs just stressed out and I need to stop overthinking too much, carry on with my life and give him time until he wants to talk to me again (well that maybe 2 weeks until his country lifts the ban or longer totally depends on his mental health) I want to message to check up on him but I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll annoy him and come off as clingy. Besides I already told him that I was available to talk. Even though it‚Äôs just his coping mechanism, it still sucks he completely shuts me out. As an INTJ I have moments of shutting people out when I‚Äôm stressed but i don‚Äôt go as long as what he‚Äôs doing. That‚Äôs why...

My brain keeps analyzing that he loses interests in me, he finds another girl to invest his time in (he‚Äôs clearly having several options) and he doesn‚Äôt want to hurt me so he decides to ghost me. And yeah we have been talking for just 3 months, we‚Äôre not in a relationship yet. This scenerio is not likely to happen because ghosting isn‚Äôt his style and I trust his human decency to not do that. But what else to explain all this?

I‚Äôm stressed out as I can‚Äôt find a clear direction to step into. I‚Äôm trying to carry on my life, be the best version of myself but in the back of my mind he‚Äôs still there. It‚Äôs so stupid that I just talk to him for 3 months and all this emotions flowing through my heart suffocate me. Is he ghosting me right now, should I invest more time and effort into him?

ISTJ,"When looking at the MBTI community, it seems as if ISTJs are some sort of outcast. Not only because of the usual sensor bias but also because too many people are stuck in prejudices without any link to reality. 

That's why I want to say something. I used to be irrationally antagonistic against ISTJs just a few years ago and seriously believed that being intuitive is a superior trait, like the next evolutionary step. I think this was a totally stupid move of mine back then and as my view changed, I began to notice what precious qualities you got.

Without you, we N types would be much more exposed to wild speculations because of our deficiency in a realistic viee of things. And you follow whatever you hold deer with absolute passion and painstaking detail. This is awesome work, and I cannot stress it enough how necessary you guys are. Don't let yourself belittle by a feeling of ""being inferior"" to us airy-fairy intuitives who often struggle heavily to maintain their own lives rather than their virtual life. It is great to have you all in this community, and I hope you realize yourself that not being an N type doesn't matter at all, because you got advantages we miss radically at times. We are completing each other, and this is imo the whole point of this community.

Have an awesome time,

And that goes for anything. She could stub her toe and you'll hear ""oh my toe oh my toe"" long after I know it's stopped hurting. Not only is it distracting, but it's irritating. She'll also do it when she gets off shift ""oh I have to go do x now"" and she'll repeat it until someone says ""ok have fun doing x!"" Does seeming attention seeking repetition bother anyone else ?

After doing this for 15 years, I am burnt out and realizing the reason I got into advertising was because of branding - not logos or brands, but the 'vibe and lifestyle' the brand portrayed. 

I'm considering looking at roles in that field, however, all ISTJ career quizes say marketing roles are careers to avoid and that we're better suited in analyst/organization type roles. I sometimes think I'd still be OK in this kind of role as it's a form of organization - making sure everything stays in order, and almost a project management like base.

Little did I know that this has a lot to do with the challenge that a task presents, as well as my ability to undertake that task. I‚Äôve realized that the sweet spot where you tend to reach your flow is when your skills are fully involved in overcoming a suitable challenge.

If you‚Äôre wondering how you can attempt to enter a state of flow with whatever you‚Äôre working on, this is what has helped me.

1. Eliminate Distractions (Both Internally and Externally)
2. Avoid Multitasking
3. Use a Time-based Productivity Technique
4. Have a Clear Outcome or Goal in Mind

ISTJ,"Long story short, three years ago I got an MA from a UK university and my supervisors was an ISTJ. At the beginning our relation wasn't great (ISTJ-INTP typical clashes), but it improved a lot, and he even accepted to support a PhD application (which does not guarantee an acceptance, but it's a high probability). And then I just left. I had a crush on him, and I knew it was going to ruin our working relationship. I was also very scared of his judgement, and I could not even properly work on my project anymore. *I know I fucked up.* 

But I decided to give it another try. A few days ago I sent him an e-mail saying that I'd like to go back to Academia (I have been working) and that I intend to apply to various universities. I explained to him that I left because I had the impression that I was not cut for this field and therefore found it difficult to work on it at that time(which is true - it's a consequence of overthinking) but that I do love the field and I'd like to give it another proper try, and I of course omitted the feeling bit (that would freak him out). So, I asked him if he is okay with being my referee in these applications. I also added that I would be very happy if he'd consider (not expecting anything) potentially supervising this project, fully knowing that now the circumstances are different (he might have other PhD students to supervise) and that I have been unreliable in the past (yes, I said that as well, because it's true). 

He took longer than usual to reply, and he said he'd be happy to be my referee, and also to help me with the project proposal (which I'll use for other unis as well), but did not say neither yes nor no to potentially being my supervisor. He said that, after working on the proposal, we can DISCUSS applying to the uni he works at if I wished.  What does that DISCUSS mean? Is it a chance, or he's just trying to be nice (it's the UK after all) but is actually saying no? The thing is that you need a supervisor to apply, and he didn't say yes or no, and neither suggested a colleague as a potential supervisor for this. I'm confused.

ISTJ,"Hi I'm Derek (ENTJ). My friends and I just recently launched an MBTI based dating app called Boo, but have gotten thousands of sign ups already. After much tweaking, we finally wanted to share this with you in the hopes that this may help you find like-minded friends and loved ones.

We felt like current dating apps were really inefficient. They help you meet more people, not more of the right people. This means wasted time, money, and emotional preparation on bad dates with no chemistry. It's not just bad dates; the time and effort from swiping, messaging, arranging dates, and preparing both emotionally and physically, just for dates to continuously not work out, has led to dating fatigue and the sense that online dating is hopeless. It's also hard to tell what a person is actually like through text, only to be disappointed after meeting or the first month of dating.

What we as MBTI enthusiasts have always known is that who we are (personality type) tends to influence the kinds of people we're attracted to, and it doesn't make sense for this not to play a part in mainstream online dating.

We wanted to create a radically authentic, transparent, and empathetic dating experience where people can feel free to be themselves, because it is exactly by being yourself that the right person will come along and like and appreciate you for who you naturally are. On Boo, if someone matched with you, they‚Äôre already aware of your best and worst traits, and still decided they‚Äôd rather have you over any other type. On Boo, you‚Äôre already what each other are looking for.

As an ISTJ, you're a true bearer of duty and facts. You're honest, responsible, and uphold your promises. But at your worst, you can be stubborn, insensitive, and inflexible. You‚Äôll want someone who sees the world as you do and loves you for your best, but also understands and forgives you at your worst, and would have it no other way.

This is probably gonna sound stereotypical, but you guys are insanely good motivators without trying to be.

A life of the mind

Our personality greatly shapes who we are as individuals and influences nearly every aspect of our life. Our place on the introversion-extroversion spectrum in particular seems to have the most impact on the choices we make in life. Where we lie on this spectrum affects the friendships we make, the jobs we choose, the habits we form and the way we act in certain situations.

In 1921, the psychologist Carl Jung first introduced the terms *introvert* and *extrovert* in his book Psychological Types. Jung described introverts as individuals who are drawn to the inner world of thought and feeling and who recharge their batteries by being alone; while extroverts are drawn to the external life of activities and people, and need to recharge when they don‚Äôt socialise enough. Researchers have since discovered new traits for both types of individuals, as well as a whole new category called the *ambivert* (which lies in the middle). For this reason, an all-purpose definition for each type does not exist but most psychologists agree that introversion and extroversion are preferences for certain levels of stimulation, with introverts requiring less stimulation and extroverts requiring more.

Modern society seems to value the extroverted individual more than the introverted individual. The archetypal extrovert demonstrates personality traits that are largely favoured by society. They are gregarious, confident and quick to action. Extroverts are generally more comfortable than introverts with socialising with others and working in teams, and justifiably praised for ‚Äúputting themself out there‚Äù. The archetypal extrovert is one who is comfortable in the spotlight while the archetypal introvert prefers the light from the lamp on their desk. While it may be that most people are not indeed pure extroverts or pure introverts and lie somewhere in the middle of the spectrum, the fondness for people who exhibit extroverted traits has been demonstrated by studies which show that talkative people are judged as smarter, better-looking, and more interesting.

Introverts, on the other hand, are more likely to have poorer social and verbal skills, and in some cases these skills are severely limited because of a social anxiety disorder. Because of the make-up of their personality, in situations such as socialising in large groups or public speaking, introverts are at a greater disadvantage. Public speaking is an introvert‚Äôs nightmare but according to the DSM-4 (the diagnostic manual for mental disorders), fear of public speaking is not just an annoyance, but a disease too. It is for these reasons that in a culture that merits verbal fluency and sociability, introversion has the potential to become a second-class personality type.

In some situations, however, extroverted traits aren‚Äôt always advantageous. While increased talking is generally associated with a greater level of insight, studies reveal that there is in fact no correlation between the two. In one study, a group of students were asked to solve math questions together, and then asked to rate the intelligence and judgement of one another. The results showed that the students who spoke first and most often were consistently given higher ratings than those who were less talkative. When looking at their suggestions however, the talkative students were no better than the quiet students. In fact, in a separate exercise the quiet students were rated as more creative and analytical. Other studies show that extroverts are more sensitive to rewards. Because of this, they are more likely than introverts to take part in risky behaviour to fulfil their ambitions, and therefore more inclined to make impulsive decisions.

These studies suggest that because introverted individuals are drawn to the internal world of thoughts ‚Äì a life of the mind, they are more likely to reflect before they act. In certain situations, such as in a conflict, this predisposition to contemplate the outcomes is favourable. Indeed, a balance between reflection and action should be ultimately desired. For this reason, when a culture values the action of the warrior extrovert, it should work to remember also the power of the worrying introvert.

&gt;‚ÄúA shy man no doubt dreads the notice of strangers, but can hardly be said to be afraid of them. He may be bold as a hero in battle, and yet have no self-confidence about trifles in the presence of strangers.‚Äù  
**Charles Darwin**

The nature of warriors and worriers

Where an individual lies on the introversion-extroversion spectrum is largely determined by their temperament. Temperament is inborn and biologically based and therefore whether you are an introvert, extrovert or ambivert is determined by nature. Personality emerges from temperament and is more complex, less stable, and alterable by cultural influences and life experiences. For this reason, while an individual may possess the biological and behavioural patterns of an introvert, they have free will, and therefore possess the ability to incorporate extroverted traits into their personality.

The psychologist Jerome Kagan hypothesised that an excitable amygdala causes an individual to have an introverted temperament. The amygdala is a structure located deep in the limbic system of the brain. The limbic system is also found in animals, and it underlies many of the basic instincts that we share with animals such as appetite and fear. The amygdala recieves information from the senses and signals to the rest of the brain how to react. It is especially sensitive to threatening stimuli in the environment and triggers the flight-or-fight response. Kagan believed that individuals with a highly reactive amygdala would be more sensitive to stimuli and present physiological reactions like increased heart rate and temperature, dilated eyes and higher blood pressure.

In a study launched in 1989, Kagan and his team exposed four-month old infants to a variety stimuli such as bursting balloons and colourful dancing mobiles. They recorded their reactions and found that about 20% cried and pumped their arms and legs energetically. Kagan called these infants ‚Äúhigh-reactive‚Äù and predicted that they would grow up to be introverts. Indeed, many of these infants grew up to develop quiet, shy, serious and cautious personalities. High reactivity and specifically excitability of the amygdala may be just one of many biological causes of temperament, but investigations into physiology suggests that introverts are more sensitive to external stimuli.

Some psychologists believe that sensitivity to stimuli arose as a by-product of our survival strategy. Evolutionary biologists have found that along with humans, other animals can be divided in to two groups: those who more sensitive to stimuli and who prefer to watch their surroundings, and those who are less sensitive and prefer to act. In some species like fruit flies and house cats, 20% of its members are shy, slow to act and observant while the other 80% are bold and fast to act. ‚ÄúShy‚Äù animals forage less, conserve more energy and are more likely to survive when predators come calling. ‚ÄúBold‚Äù animals, though more likely to be eaten, take greater risks and are more likely to survive when food is scarce. For these reasons, both traits are advantageous for an animal‚Äôs survival.

An instinct for harmony

It is often the case that the bold members of our species are most valued, but the abilities of those who possess a shy predisposition should not be ignored. In Kagan‚Äôs studies, he found that when high-reactive infants grew up to be children, they tended to think and feel more deeply about their everyday experiences. These children were more likely to spend time in observation of other children and comtemplate the actions of themselves and others. Studies show that when a high-reactive child accidentally breaks another child‚Äôs toy, they feel a more intense mix of guilt and sorrow than low-reactive children.

The connection between sensitivity and conscience has been further established by further studies. In one study, a woman hands children a toy that is rigged to break when played with. Some of the children showed more signs of guilt than others, displaying behaviour such as looking away, hiding their faces and hugging themselves. It is the children who we might call high-reactive and who are likely to be introverts that felt most guilty. This is not to those who are more extroverted don‚Äôt feel emotions and lack a conscience. Instead, these studies suggest that those who have a biological disposition to be more sensitive, and therefore more likely to be introverted, seem to feel things more.

Other studies suggest that your degree of extroversion determines how many friends you have but not how good of a friend you are. In one study of 132 students, the psychologists set out to understand the link between personality traits and relationships. They found that those who had an extroverted personality found it easier to form relationships but that this trait did not correlate with how harmonious the relationships were. Instead, those who had more of the trait known as agreeableness, found in both introverts and extroverts, had more harmonious relationships. In another study, pairs of introverts and extroverts talked to each other on the phone. While the extrovert pairs chose light-hearted topics, the introvert pairs discussed problems or conflicts in their lives. And when paired with the opposite type, both introverts and extroverts appreciated the difference in conversation topics. These studies suggest that introverts are as able, and in some cases more able, to form meaningful social connections as extroverts.

These studies suggest that the shy and quiet personalities that introverts have is not a weakness. They show that introverts are likely to have an intense conscience and a need to talk about meaningful topics, traits that help them to form valuable relationships. Introverts have an instinct for harmony. In many situations, it is introverted traits like contemplating the world around you and restraining yourself to talk only when needed that are preferable. It may be that we all lie somewhere in the middle of the spectrum and that we are more able to amass traits from each type than we think. If this is the case, it will be good to remember of both the power of acting and the power of reflecting.

&gt;‚ÄúI have naturally formed the habit of restraining my thoughts. A thoughtless word hardly ever escaped my tongue or pen. Experience has taught me that silence is part of the spiritual discipline of a votary of truth. We find so many people impatient to talk. All this talking can hardly be said to be of any benefit to the world. It is so much waste of time. My shyness has been in reality my shield and buckler. It has allowed me to grow. It has helped me in my discernment of truth.‚Äù

He‚Äôs not spontaneous or adventurous‚Äîhe ALWAYS needs a plan. (Hates change)

ISTJ,"I have been into the whole mbti thing for a while now, but I am still not sure about my type. I think that I might be an ISTJ, but something about it still doesn't feel right. 

The pros 
- I am very practical when it comes to day to day matters and hate it when people are to complicated and inconvenient
- I like being organized and to know what will happen over the day, so usually I am not very spontaneous
- getting out of my familiar environment makes me uncomfortable and even anxious (but mostly because of the unknown social interactions i have to face i guess)
- i am bad at small talk and dont have this natural feeling what is right to do in social Situations some people have 
- i respect rules and have a natural tendency to stick to them. I am annoyed with people questioning them just for the sake of it


The cons
- I am not much into details. I am more likely to oversee important things because I am to inpatient to focus on them
- although I am mentally practical, I am definitely not physically. I am that kind of person that is very likely to drop things randomly, walk against doors or cause an accident. Sometimes I am just so focused on my thoughts that i forget what my body does
- the stereotypical ISTJ jobs are not for me, I want to deal with people (i am about to become a teacher)
- i dont have this hardworking and goaldriven attitude that ISTJs seem to pull of. I am quite lazy from time to time and leave projects unfinished when they loose their fascination
- I love deeptalk and pilosophical stuff, especially with my INFJ friend, we can talk for hours 


Also I thought that I might be an INTJ, but I am reluctant saying that cause I read that many peoply mistype as INTJs because they want to be ""edgy"" and a rare type..

ISTJ,"My older brother (ISTJ) and I (INFJ) haven't been talking for 4 years now. We aren't fighting, we aren't hating each other. We just don't talk. We both are introverts, so there's nothing particularly strange in that (he, however, is much much more quiet than I am).

Having said that, I can't help but to notice his passive-aggressive attitude towards me. He never addresses to me at home and seems visible uncomfortable with my presence (no, I am not imagining things. I've got 7 siblings and he only I get his exclusive treatment). 

He thinks I'm a snob (he called me this under his breath once) and he thinks I dislike him (we did talk once, and he said I treat others better than I treat him). Is he right? I don't know, but I can definitely see why he thinks that way.

My point is, I want to make peace with him. He's my brother so whether I want it or not, I can never get away from him. I want to confront him but I HONESTLY have no idea what to say to him.

It's worth realizing that the only standards that truly matter are your own. I can relate to some wanting to be someone else but i dont really want that, i want to be me and just be loved and appreciated all the more for it. I wont lie, at times I breakdown and ask why I am the way I am, it always leads to hurt, upset, disappointment, regret, etc. I realize I am who I am just the same as the reason we all are the way we are is because the world needs everyone of all backgrounds to balance things out. We're all unique in our own ways and no one is an exception. We are outstanding in our own way and no one of any type really needs anyone to tell them that. We all have the ability to be ourselves, that's the one thing each person can do that no one else can replicate perfectly. You all have that uniqueness despite that you have the same personality type as someone else, what you believe, or even if you agree with me on any of this.

ISTJ,"A few years ago I got an MA from a highly ranked University in a very theoretical discipline (contrary to stereotypes, ISTJs do very well in N stuff), and one of my professors was an ISTJ. I took a few classes with him and he also become my dissertation supervisor at the end of the year as he was interested in the topic (I was really really lucky - pretty much everyone wanted to work with him and he is also very well-known in his field). I also wanted to do a PhD and he said he'd support an application for me. And then I just disappeared for one year. 

Now a bit of background. I moved to a foreign country specifically for this MA, and despite having a similar background as an undergrad, the focus was quite different and I did struggle at the beginning, with the language and also the assignments (the assessment methods were entirely different). I know he thought I was dumb and was very condescending with me. He'd make a 'I'm not so surprised' face (you can read a lot on his face) when I told him I was not grasping some of the concepts. I am an INTP and our thinking process is usually slower compared to that of Te types, but once I understand a concept, I know everything about it. Another time I went to his office hours,  for the most part I used to email him because I did not want to bother him much - and leave him the time to answer the email when he was free, and I thought he was busy with other students, while he was actually talking to a woman who must have been either his partner or a acquaintance. When he came out of the office he said he didn't have time for me (while actually there still were 15 minutes left and I only had a very quick question), so I just left. Let's say that there have been other episodes like this. 

The breaking point (in a positive way) was in the second semester. I went to his office hours to ask for some reading recommendations and I was silently looking at the wall while he was looking for the papers (I am not good with small talk and I assumed he didn't want to speak to me either). Then for politeness he asked me about my modules and I told him the truth, that one of them was boring. He got mad and yelled at  me 'how do I dare saying that when they put lots of effort into that?'. I got a bit annoyed by his exaggerated reaction and I calmly told him that he asked me for an opinion first, and I thought he wanted an honest one. If he didn't want to hear about it, he simply should not have asked as I had not intention of saying anything if he hadn't brought up the topic. Then I left. The day after I had a lesson with him and I thought he'd still be mad at me, but then when I looked at him he said 'Good morning' and smiled at me (never happened before). From that day on, he'd always greet me with a smile in the morning (I know he didn't do this with other students, because I had analysed the hell out of him) and he was always looking at me when explaining during lectures. So, I started going to his office hours a bit more frequently and he was very friendly, would genuinely laugh at my jokes, roll his eyes when he thought  I was saying something dumb, and share more about himself - he usually never talks about his projects, and he is extremely reserved in general, but when I mentioned some of the books I was reading, he'd enthusiastically say 'Oh, I have contributed to that.' So I assumed he felt comfortable in my presence. I worked really really hard and in one of his modules I was the student who got the highest mark. 

So, he also become my supervisor and we started working on my dissertation. I suggested to have a 'let's be honest with each other' kind-of- deal, so there is no miscommunication between us (I also don't get hints, so it was better for both). We got along fairly well for the most (he even offered to lend me some of his books - despite the University having a really good library), and we have also had some heated arguments (but nothing we we'd bring up again), but in general I'd say we were fairly understanding and accepting of each other's shortcomings. But, unfortunately, along the way I must have caught some feelings, and I started exhibiting the symptoms when writing my dissertation. I was obviously terrified when I found out (INTPs don't gradually process emotions like other type, so we become aware of them months later, when they decide to suddenly stab us in the back and leave us there unconscious and agonising) and I didn't want him to find out about it, so I started to overthink everything. Some times he'd look nervous and constantly touching his face while looking at me, or we would just look at each other for a few minutes without saying anything, and I'd panic thinking he knows. Other times he'd be very comfortable, talk about his cat or other relatively personal things (he'd just light up when doing this), and even sitting sloppily on his chair with his legs wide open. I was going insane and I just could not read him anymore. Now, we never talk about very personal or private things, nor I ask as I am very reserved myself - I wish he had mentioned his partner/wife at least once: that would have broken my heart enough to accept reality and move on, but he didn't (not blaming him here - it's not his responsibility). I could not be honest with him, so I took my time to process this, in which I did not get in touch with (but I told him I would) him with the hope that this was over as soon as possible. One year was over - I was still feeling the same, so I decided to apply to a few other universities and never bring  back the topic about applying with him as a supervisor anymore. I was rejected by those unis (it was insanely competitive), but I know he wrote positive reference letters (I never understood what he really thought about me at the end, but it's probably not as bad as I feared). Now, it has almost been three years since then. I genuinely want to work with him and I want to ask him to be my supervisor again, but I am afraid he thinks I am too unreliable and would not want to take the risk to work with someone uncommitted. So, my question is: how do I approach the topic to him? Would he still want to work with me? I am terrified that he might say no, but I think I am also ready to know the truth. If he doesn't want/can't, I'll move on.

ISTJ,"I'm planning or writing a book filled with individual short stories geared specifically for ISTJs. 

Outside of the pure stories, the book will include the path to growth, developing functions, and so on. It'll have actionable advice embedded into the stories. 

Also, the advice won't be including the idea of functions. It'll just have pure situational perspectives which allow for self-awareness to happen just naturally.

In order to write this book in the best way possible for you guys, I'd appreciate if you answered the following questions: How do you learn best?  What genre of stories do you like?  What writing style suits you best in order to enjoy reading a book?",1587843460

ISTJ,"Hi! It's Lou (ESFJ) and Jess (INFP) here. We're two sisters who have recently set up a dating app and website based on Myers-Briggs personality types called So Syncd.

The app has only just become available in the app stores (iOS and Android), but we've had thousands of sign ups already.

Firstly, we wanted to let you know about it because we thought it might be of interest. We've had lots of people get in touch to say they are having some amazing conversations and they've never connected with such great people on a dating app. Most people aren't meeting up in person at the moment due to coronavirus, and of course, safety comes first, but the app usage has gone through the roof as people get to know each other better online and make meaningful connections.

Secondly, we are refining the UI/UX at the moment and we'd really appreciate any feedback (either on here or at [hello@sosyncd.com](mailto:hello@sosyncd.com)).

It's free to sign up and it only takes a couple of minutes to do so, if you know your personality type already, which you guys obviously do! You also have the option of searching for specific personality types. You just need to search for So Syncd in the App Store or Play Store or follow the link to the website below.

We hope you are safe and well during this challenging time. Jess and Lou x

ISTJ,"So many of us have been confined to our homes for some time now and but the truth is that there are only so many Zoom calls and shows on Netflix that you can watch before you‚Äôre utterly bored.

I‚Äôve realized that part of getting over boredom is to begin to get things done that give you a sense of pride or accomplishment. In other words, finding a way to progress with your goals and ambitions.

Often when we have time on our hands, we fall into patterns of behavior associated with filler activity, otherwise known as ‚Äúbusy work‚Äù. We send countless emails, browse social media, or jump from task to task. Instead it would help to let our mind wander so that we can understand exactly ‚ÄúWhat is causing our boredom.‚Äù While boredom and the constant restlessness can be frustrating, I‚Äôve realized that there are also a few benefits of it as well.

1. The mind relaxes and allows for more focus eventually
2. We start to think of how we can improve our lives
3. We begin to identify what is causing disappointment in our lives

Another thing that I want to highlight is the difference between doing and thinking. When we‚Äôre bored, we‚Äôre only thinking for the most part, but not doing things that are more aligned with our self-fulfillment.

I break a lot of this down further here - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of6wP555A2M&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of6wP555A2M&amp;feature=youtu.be)

I always research the easiest classes to take so that I can get all A's with little effort. I rush and finish tasks ASAP to enjoy free time doing whatever I want.

\- I usually step up as group leader in my classes because I find others to be incompetent and lazy.

\- I'm great at saving money and always look for the cheapest yet most effective option. I hardly spend money because I enjoy seeing my bank account increase.

\- I'm very good at planning, organizing, and managing my time. I always do things first minute and am on top of all my responsibilities. Before I even went to college, I planned an entire roadmap of the entire 120 units I need to take. I love to think about my future career.

\- I'm a decisive person. My friends often come to me for advice about which option to choose. I've made class schedules for a lot of my friends. 

\- I don't talk much unless it's revolved around my interests and am on the more reserved side.

\- Some friends have described me as intimidating and blunt (direct speaking, not rude).

\- Everyone thinks I'm very smart and often ask me to help tutor them or see my homework answers. 

\- I'm assertive, action-oriented, and an opportunist. I've won multiple scholarships, got my first job at age 16, and started working a job related to my major in my freshman year.

\- I have a bad temper and can't hold my tongue when I'm angry. I have gotten into a lot of arguments, even when I should've bitten my tongue. I've argued with a teacher, government worker, bus driver, etc. Aside from when I'm mad, I don't start drama for no reason.

\- I have a lot of confidence in myself and may even seem arrogant because I sometimes brag about my accomplishments and ability to succeed.

\- I have a tendency to always think I'm right and not accept other people's opinions. I can be judgmental about people who aren't the same as me.

\- I'm family oriented and protective over those I care about. Although I'm polite to others, I couldn't care less about anyone who isn't in my inner circle.

ISTJ,"I‚Äôve realized throughout my life that the more I subjected myself to discomfort, the more fulfilled I felt when I made it through it. This is something that you kind of have to force yourself to do though. It has never come naturally to me.

It‚Äôs not easy because every atom in your body can reject leaving your happy place in pursuit of doing something that might help you grow and become better, simply because of fear and discomfort.

But one of the things that I learned is that leaving your comfort zone and reaching your growth zone in one particular area has a few steps. They look like this:

* Comfort Zone
* Fear Zone: This is the area where most people get stuck and have a hard time making it though because your self-confidence takes a hit
* Learning Zone: This is part where your gain a better sense on whether the changes that you are making are bringing you fulfillment
* Growth Zone: Your objectives have been conquered but the work continues

Most people crumble under the stress and anxiety of discomfort but plenty of research had found that a mild amount of stress is necessary to maximize performance. Too much stress can make you crawl back into your comfort zone.

This sweet spot is called Optimal Anxiety and is what most people should aim for. I break this down further for your info here - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiWvIoJURCY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiWvIoJURCY)",1587141899

ISTJ,"I suspect my father is an ISTJ. I asked if he would take the test but he thinks it's silly, but I am 99% certain from reading about it to know he is a full fledged ISTJ. 

Compared to my mother (an ESFJ) I've always felt some distance between me and my father. My mother is very playful and cheerful and always played with me and my siblings when we were kids, she still does, in a different way now that we're older (teasing and joking around). But I don't have many fond childhood memories of my father. He worked hard in a job he hated to support us and travelled a lot and when he was home he just stayed in his corner watching tv. He was always very hard to approach. Whenever I tried he was never in the mood to play or take me and my siblings out for a walk. The only time he really opened up was when we watched movies from the 80's (like Star Wars, Back to the Future, Indiana Jones or Police Academy) or when he talked about music (he plays guitar, bass and the drums). So it was through movies and music that I was able to feel closer to him, and I still enjoy those things to this day. He has these scary emotional explosions when he and my mother argue, I try to mediate but I feel overwhelmed and intimidated by him when he is like this, as if he is a completely different person. But I know deep in my heart that he would never do anything to harm us or my mom, and he never has. My mom is usually the catalyst for their fights, since she  can be very stubborn even when she is wrong, and my father is the same so they clash. After finding out about MBTI, a lot of his behaviours and choices started to make sense. I know he loves us in his own way, he shows his affection by supporting his financially, but I want to feel closer to him. I tried talking to him about this and he got offended that I questioned his love for us, which was not all what I meant. I'm sort of at a loss here, is there a way to become closer to him without confronting him directly about this? Solving the problem in a roundabout way?

ISTJ,"I‚Äôve tried browsing through some of the older posts about this combination, but I couldn‚Äôt find what I was looking for and thought I‚Äôd crack the door here and ask myself.

Some backstory:
I am an INTP who was in a whirlwind, long term and complicated romantic relationship with an ENTP. We totally understood each other‚Äôs thought processes and would have incredibly stimulating conversations from philosophy and psychology to futurism and ancient history.

This chapter in my life has closed and I am making attempts at befriending other people and personality types that I am more unfamiliar with.

However, the kind of connection that I had with the ENTP is something that I miss deeply. 

Recently, I‚Äôve met a potential new friend who self identifies as an ISTJ and in discussing the interactions I‚Äôve had with them, discovered that an older friend of mine was also an ISTJ. I was never too close to this older one because there seemed to be somewhat of a wave difference in our expression (we‚Äôre both artists who make similar work, but are very different in the way we socialize). We respect each other and care for one another, but there‚Äôs a sense of disconnect that I recognize. They‚Äôre someone I can rely on in a situation of need, but not exactly the friend that gets into these deep, ethereal discussions.

I‚Äôm finding that to be the same dynamic with this new friend. They seem to want to engage with me, but at the same time, I find that I often question if I‚Äôm coming off as ‚Äútoo much‚Äù. I get really romantic about concepts and passionate about my interests and in an attempt to bridge the gap, I try to ask about theirs and their motivations for creating (they‚Äôre also an artist). 

It‚Äôs not easy for me the read what the dynamic is. I‚Äôve tiptoed around a bit in our discussions because I don‚Äôt want to over share or cause them discomfort for inadvertently prying too deep, but for me, friendship comes from a sense of mutual respect and it‚Äôs hard for me to develop that with someone who comes off as cautious and a little distant. I know that they‚Äôre passionate about what they do, but I haven‚Äôt yet seen that excitement expressed overtly and I wonder what that means for a friendship. 

Btw ‚Äîin person, they are completely engaged, but through text is where I‚Äôm struggling to connect and since this covid-19 situation, we haven‚Äôt been able to see each other in person.

...

What do ISTJs think of your INTP friends? 

I know that you‚Äôre very careful thinkers, but when it comes conversing with the perceiving types, does the dialectic banter get tedious or annoying? 

Do you find that your friendships develop more slowly and cautiously than other types?

How do you express that you‚Äôre interested or care in a friendship?

Thank you for taking the time to consider my questions. I‚Äôd also love to hear anything anecdotal about your perspective on INTPs in general and your best and worst experiences with them.

ISTJ,"Hello, I'm a long time(ish) lurker and I haven't posted anything on this sub before. I have tested several times as an ISTJ-A and have done quite a bit of research on cognitive functions. Granted, I am not as well versed as some people on this sub are so I would like some help in determining if it is correct or not.

Here's some information about me:

Age:

17 (Male)

Parents:

INTJ (Mother) ENFP(Father) ISFP(Brother)

Best Friend:

19 year-old ENTP (Male)

Interests:

Reading, Self Development, Athletics (did Parkour for 4 years and am now doing Tae Kwon Do / Krav Maga), Mathematics, Physics, Programming, researching anything of interest (for fun), drinking/brewing tea, fragrances, Hair care products / shaving products, survival, and anything that can optimize and improve my life for mind and body.

Key Inferences:

Yesterday I was explaining to my family on how to optimize hair growth (since we are in quarantine and I have always wanted to have a Clint Eastwood/Josey Wales Quiff) and I was spewing out so many details that my Mother said that she now gets why her family kind of resented her a bit at times (because of the know-it-all stereotype). Now, to be clear, I was in no way trying to come off as a ""know-it-all"" and that incident was really the deciding factor as to why I decided to post here. For some more background info, me and my mother's life have been pretty much identical, as far as life events go. Just in different circumstances. We both were overweight and decided to change that ourselves at roughly the same time in our lives (that being around 6th to 7th grade) and we both started taking extreme ownership of our lives and decisions following our epiphanies that we could control our selves and our outcomes in the world. She is currently a full-stack developer and I am learning how to program using GIT, Python, and Java. We both find it very easy to communicate with each other and she has been the main model for how I have wanted to operate in this world. Even from a very young age I saw the differences in the ways that my parents interacted with their environments and I decided to ""do everything how my mom did it"" in essence. Another reason as to why this has been a thought in my mind is because of how I have structured my life. I always make sure that I ""Get everything done, at the time that it needs to be done, and get it done well"". Also I currently sleep on the floor, take cold/contrast showers, do NoFap, wear minimalist shoes, use a standing desk, and eat/manage a pescotarian diet. I'm not sure if I'm just an ISTJ with highly developed Introverted Intuition, or just an INTJ. I'm fine being an ISTJ, but I would prefer to know with more accuracy my actual cognitive functions based on peer-review. I have also been told (on multiple occasions) that my resting face looks angry. I know this is a possible indicator of Introverted Intuition + Extroverted Thinking but again, I'm not positive. I also recall a video that I watched on YouTube about an In depth look at the ISTJ. It stated that the ISTJ is akin to a Sea-captain who has seen alot and with a strange combination of optimistic pessimism. I relate to that and I have also been perceived as pessomistic at times even though that's not how I actually perceive thing most of the time. I have no aversion to planning long term (with a physical planner), I am just unsure of how to configure a process that I can use on daily basis at this time. My mother is actually the person that got us into using planners and I'm consulting her as to how to best utilize them.  Likewise, I soak up information like a dry sponge. I did used to watch YouTube quite a bit but I have been transitioning to books to get a more ""holistic"" understanding of my interests.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR:

My Mom is a bonified INTJ and our life events have been very similar as far as growing up is concerned. We both are into self improvement and think similarly on many topics. I have typed several times as an ISTJ-A and I'm all about that Bruce Lee quote of implementing everything that is useful and discarding the rest. I have been told that I have an incredible ability of absorbing and  delivering esoteric information at any time. I've also been accused of going ""off topic"" during conversations and talking about things that people honestly don't care about but that I find interesting. Granted, they're usually related in some way to the conversation but delivered with so much detail that people stop listening or I get the memo that it's not needed. I've tested as an INTP once before but I'm not sure if I fit into the care free intelectual category.

Thank you for reading and any feedback is greatly appreciated. Have a wonderful day!

I'd like to know, what made you guys interested in exploring MBTI and what benefit do you personally get from it? Is it for self-discovery? Learning about others? Just interested to know a bit more about ISTJs and how ya'll think.

ISTJ,"Hi 

INFP here. :) I just wanted to ask a question about ISTJ/ ESTJ. 

Do you have a weird sense of humour? My ex and I think boyfriend mother are ISTJ I'm guessing and they both have this odd sense of humour. I've seen it before but unsure which type it is?

It's like a vengeful type of humour, like getting one over on people and thinking it's funny , like really quite vengeful and winding people up that way and thinking it's funny? Does this sound like ISTJ or another type?

Like I remember a story where either he or she said that they wore a certain perfume and their boss kindly asked them not to as they got terrible migraines so they then wore loads more of it just to piss them off! 

Is this introverted or extroverted thinking I'm seeing gone weird? Or even extroverted feeling gone weird? 

If anyone can help me out, much appreicated

ISTJ,"Hi! I‚Äôm (female, ENFP, mid-20‚Äôs) am in a 4 year long distance relationship with an ISTJ (male, mid 20‚Äôs). Would love to have ISTJ input on relationships!

I‚Äôm worried about compatibility, because it feels like we are two people on two different planes of existence. 

I can tell my ISTJ loves me so much and really puts in the effort into our relationship. I am crazy in love with his qualities and he‚Äôs one of the best people I‚Äôve ever met. At the same time, I struggle being myself with him and it feels suffocating. 

When we‚Äôre together, I feel like we bring out the extreme versions of ourselves. He becomes even more logical, quiet, dominant, and confrontational; I become even more nonsensical, clumsy, random, and submissive than I actually am. 

I‚Äôve confronted him about how his confrontation makes me feel like I can‚Äôt be myself. He‚Äôs been getting better about not being as quick to attack but sometimes it slips. 

Other concerns include the fact that we have no interest in each other‚Äôs passions regardless of both of our earnest attempts to read up on them.  

To me, the most important thing in a relationship is deep connection and understanding. I really struggle with getting that mutual connection, any understanding, or any decent conversation from ISTJ. 

He‚Äôs so low energy in everything that he does and I‚Äôm so high energy and want to do all the things. 

When we‚Äôre in a group of people, our personalities become more neutralized and we actually have chemistry. But the problem is we‚Äôre not always going to have others to naturalize us in life. 

I‚Äôm further concerned because he‚Äôs tolerant of the person that I am when I‚Äôm at my most happy and creative. I don‚Äôt think he actually likes that happy version of me, which makes me fear a life of limited happiness for us both. 

I‚Äôm worried because he has been wanting us to get married for a while now. I don‚Äôt know if we‚Äôll be able to stand each other.

Any thoughts or advice? Would be very much appreciated!",1586215294
ISTJ,"For whichever ISTJ is willing, Id appreciate some help. I‚Äôm a 30f entp, engaged to a 24m istj. We live in different countries, but I was planning on moving to his on April 1 before the virus cancelled m flight (and yes, we‚Äôve lived together prior, he‚Äôs not a stranger). I‚Äôm very direct and forward with my partner, I don‚Äôt sugarcoat my wants and needs. I‚Äôm confused because ISTJs are supposed to be responsible, yet I feel like I‚Äôm the one carrying the relationship, I feel like he doesn‚Äôt put his 50%. For example, responsibilities and drive. I worked while he was in college and he told me once he was done that he would start working so I didn‚Äôt have to anymore. He finishes, but then decides he wants a few months break before he working.. ok, fine. I start getting stressed because I‚Äôm supposed to move in 3 months and he still hasn‚Äôt applied. So I help him and he‚Äôs ok w that. I ask him if he‚Äôs applied, some days he says yes others no. I tell him looking for a job is a full time job.. he should be applying every day? I make a new resume for him, I send him job links, I even apply for him. That‚Äôs the thing.. I shouldn‚Äôt have done any of that. I should trust him enough to not just do it on his own, but WANT to. Is my ISTJ broken?

The immigration lawyers told us to write a couple pages about our relationship for my visa.. I finished that months ago and submitted it. He didn‚Äôt even start months later because I kept nagging him and he still hasn‚Äôt finished. I told him he should while we‚Äôre all on lockdown.. his response was why? Lawyers office is closed anyway. I told him.. ‚Äúwell, to be responsible and be well prepared?‚Äù 

I quit my job back in Feb because I was moving and wanted to focus on that and now with the virus, I‚Äôve applied for new positions because I know it‚Äôs gonna be a long time until I can move. I wish he had the initiative to come up with that idea himself for himself .. but he said ‚Äúwhy? I get paid an avg salary for doing nothing‚Äù. I said.. ‚Äúwell for your own personal gain? Maybe do freelance so you build a portfolio or enroll in a course to help you get ahead from other graduates?‚Äù. I told him all this free time I have because of the virus and before we get married - I see it as an opportunity to do things, try things, learn shit. He said he feels the opposite, he wants to do nothing and relax before real life begins again. He says that once I am there, he‚Äôs going to pick up the slack and ‚Äútake care of me‚Äù.. I ask what about now? He says we‚Äôre not together irl so he‚Äôs helpless.. I told him that‚Äôs just an excuse, there‚Äôs always loopholes or ‚Äúif there‚Äôs a will, there‚Äôs a way‚Äù. He said he can‚Äôt because of our time difference, his free time he wants to spend w me, not discover or follow any  interests/hobbies and if he gets a job, I would be sad because I‚Äôd never have time to talk to him. 

He said I was being controlling and I said yes because I don‚Äôt trust him enough to give it up but I wish and I WANT to not have it. If he just proves himself, I‚Äôd give it up happily but if neither of us have it.. nothing would get done and our relationship would become complacent.

We see things so differently and I feel lost. I see where he‚Äôs coming from but I just don‚Äôt agree. My Ne and his Si really clash. We love each other a lot and we want to make it work.. I just don‚Äôt know how to approach him. Maybe I‚Äôm being too direct and he need some more understanding? I just think maybe there‚Äôs something lost in translation.

My ISTJ has been strangely ... ummm... how do I say it... ‚Äúundisciplined‚Äù lately. Like he‚Äôs been very forgiving towards what we are doing, particularly what I‚Äôm ‚Äúmisconducting‚Äù.

For example he would purposely make a 8 minute drive to get to my place to do jogging every morning and I forgot to turn on the alarm, making him wait for 25 minutes or so before leaving early for work. I woke up in shock and called and apologized and he was totally okay???  He was even laughing throughout the call, asked why and he‚Äôs like he‚Äôs happy to hear me???

He‚Äôs been so lenient... that we should get more rounds around the neighborhood as my jogging mileage grows. He was strict on that but now he‚Äôs very casual with it. We just fixed on 10 rounds per day (just casually up down hill). 

And ... the bedding had been cranky and unfruitful lately, unlike the time before where we can annihilate the bedroom and he was immensely satisfied. I was a bit apologetic, awkward because it‚Äôs on my side of the problem. We tried several times. And we washed several times, wiped dry several times too. Annoying but he seems fine too??? And said he just want to cuddle me sleep.  

I admit I‚Äôm a clumsy person but he‚Äôs taking it too well? And he even said such attribute is cute?? From time to time? He sounded intoxicated tbh... and I‚Äôm worried if thats true and it wears off one day with actual rage pent up unknowingly inside ...

ISTJ,"tldr: istj stereotype is boring, teens don't like boring. teens also want to know more about their identity, but because istj is boring, they don't type as istj, and thus there aren't many posts on this subreddit that have istjs asking about the istj type.

There was a post a few days ago asking why the posts on r/istj were mostly questions from other types about ISTJs, which got me thinking.

If we look at r/intj, most of the posts are mainly intjs asking other intjs if they exhibit certain behavior. For example, a while back there was a post along the lines of ""hey fellow intjs do you walk fast?"" or something along those lines.

And then every so often there comes along someone who posts a post complaining about how all of the ""hey intjs do you do this thing"" are all just a bunch of teenagers looking for validation, and how they're mostly mistyped.

This got me thinking.

If what the second type of people are saying is correct, then we can see why r/intj is such a hotspot for such activity. If we look at the [breakdown of MBTI types worldwide](https://www.careerplanner.com/MB2/TypeInPopulation.cfm), intjs make up 2.1% of the population. Compare that to istjs, who make up 11.6% of the population. These numbers vary (in other surveys intjs are the second rarest type, but in the linked statistics they are third, while 16 personalities claims that istjs are the most common type, but the linked statistics have them at third most common), but the general trend is that istjs are common and that intjs are rare.

Being a teen would tie into the statistical breakdown of MBTI types. Teens are often seen as seeking ways to label themselves unique and different, which is what labeling oneself as an intuitive type offers, especially intjs. (16 personalities starts off by saying ""It can be lonely at the top. Being one of the rarest personality types and being among the most capable people, Architects know this all too well."" Can't get any more unique and special than that. - 16 personalities is often seen as bogus, but it's many people's first introduction to MBTI) Teens are also known for being rebellious and resisting tradition and authority.

Compare this to istjs. When people talk about istjs (which is mostly done through stereotypes), they say that istjs are traditional, boring, and robotic. Their positive traits are being dependable and hard working. Compare this to intuitive types who are stereotyped as brilliant, creative, unique, cool, amazing, etc. As a teen, sensors, and istjs in particular, are seen as boring and traditional, which is what a lot of teens hate. This causes them to mistype as intj or some other intuitive type.

Now what does this have to do with the types of posts on r/istj? If we assume all of the above is true, then we can see that there aren't many teens who identify as istj (because istjs are boring), and because teens often have a turbulent sense of identity, they want guidance, so they post on mbti subreddits to learn more about their types and thus themselves, but because there are few istj teens, r/istj doesn't get those kinds of posts

Instead, most of the posts are other types seeking (oftentimes romantic) guidance on istjs, which makes sense, as understanding your (romantic) partner is a thing that doesn't go away with age.

But then again, I've only followed r/istj and r/intj as well as r/mbti and r/mbtimemes a lot, and other mbti subreddits might suggest something different.

ISTJ,"Hello,

I was wondering if any of you here have a job that requires a lot of social interaction. If yes, how do you cope with it?

Asking because my job is increasingly requiring me to have more interactions with both a supplier (monitoring deliveries and their production) and a customer (basically, reporting what is happening with the supplier and managing expectations). I spend a lot of time in this sort of communication (including with colleagues).

I wouldn't mind to have this kind of interaction every once in a while. It's good as it gives you a full perspective of the business and creates some novelty which is appreciated from time to time. However, doing this on a daily basis (or what is going to be on a daily basis), it is starting to bother me. I don't want to spend my mornings on the phone and feel like I haven't gotten any work done (and be exhausted from all the talking).

So, if any of you work in a similar way, how do you cope with it? How does it also affect your social life? If I'm on the phone all the time, I want to be quiet/relax after work, but I still want to see some friends every once in a while (I'm already bad in catching up with friends, I'm afraid this might exacerbate the problem).",1585930024

 I would like to request for tips that work(ed) out for you personally when working with making a schedule and implementing said schedule. If you would, it would be very helpful to lay it out as your own perspective or through anecdotes, so I can imagine how and why you do it.

Do you make room for contingencies or time for relaxation, and how do you do/calculate it? How do you incorporate flexibility in your schedule? What is your rule of thumb when there are other happenings that disrupt your schedule or flow?

The Background: 
I am trying to improve in these skills, and it has been a frustration since Te is INFPs‚Äô inferior function. I could make a good and efficient plan‚Äì such as a study plan for a long exam‚Äì with all the schedule broken down into reasonable duration or days and what subjects and tasks to cover.

ISTJ,"What a challenging duo, in the best way! The thing is.. as an ENTP, it‚Äôs the best time but not so much for them. I live for challenge and change. My ISTJ.. it causes him major stress. Where I see our downfalls as opportunities or ‚Äújust life‚Äù, I happily move on but they stay stuck and see them as failures and have a hard time letting go, or if they do let go, they bring it up later again. The fact that we disagree makes me more drawn to them but they see it as a negative thing. I can be rather arrogant, opinionated, pushy.. I like to bring up controversial topics or instigate criticism for improvement whether it‚Äôs with myself, them, the relationship, or other things. This makes them very uneasy and hesitant. I almost feel like a bully sometimes? Eventually, they become resistant and lash out and become the bully even though I had no ill intentions, but they see it as a personal attack.

That‚Äôs why I think a different type would be best suited as they wouldn‚Äôt have to deal with stress as much. My ISTJ just wants a drama free life and to keep to themselves and just chill.. but that‚Äôs just not me. I need constant progression, to be constantly thinking and strumming up ideas and doing stuff that pushes me and my relationship out of the comfort zone.

Sometimes I think their life would be better off without me. I know that‚Äôs not what they want, but because I do see a lot of possibilities, it‚Äôs hard not to dismiss that one.

Does anyone have any experience or suggestions on what‚Äôs worked for them and what hasn‚Äôt? Is finding ‚Äúexternal stimuli‚Äù the only thing that works? So far, I found that it has been.

So this coworker I have an interest in has been walking with me home a few times. On the last occasion, a Friday, he asked me what I was gonna do this weekend. I thought that he had no other topic of conversation so I mocked him replying that he asked that because we have nothing else to talk about besides work so he had to think about that weird question to break the silence.

ISTJ,"Hi everyone, I have come to this subreddit to have better understanding of ISTJ guys. 

The guy I have been talking with recently is very nice. He‚Äôs logical and he doesn‚Äôt deal in emotions. He doesn‚Äôt want to have kids and he won‚Äôt date any religious girl. We have been talking over a month and we find ourselves quite aligned, and I‚Äôm INTJ btw. I‚Äôm introverted and very insecured about opening up. 

Sometimes I feel a little suffocating around him. Even though we‚Äôre not in the relationship level yet, he states pretty clear that I suit his necessary requirements for an ideal girl (no kid, non religion). He has high standards and he wants to know very much all the details about my personal life‚Äôs story to understand ‚Äúthe truth of the universe‚Äù. I feel like I‚Äôm his object to investigate and satisfy his curiosity. 

I on the other hands want to know much more about him too but he‚Äôs so hard to be broken down in pieces. I always feel like he‚Äôs that kinda hard wall. We have the same views on life, same taste of music, movies and food. We haven‚Äôt met yet just been texting 2 or 3 days a time.

ISTJ,"If not, why?

If so, how do you use it and what for?

Which of these do you relate to more?

1. I rush through jotting things down. I'm not bothered with making things look nice/I don't have time. I'd rather my planner be very simplistic and organized than cluttered with unnecessary details. It may not look nice but what is written matters more.
2. It may be time-consuming, but I put special effort into making everything look pleasing to the eye. It can sometimes get a bit cluttered with so many things going down/it looks messy but I know how to navigate everything. I plan best with an aesthetically pleasing planner/it just looks nice. It needs to look nice/I would prefer it to look nice.

For me at least, I want to make things look nicer but sometimes I get so caught up into making things look eye-appealing that its main purpose is forgotten. My planners are very ""boring"" but it still works for me. I wish my planners and stuff looked like the ones on Pinterest but it's too much work, which is also why I don't do bullet journals. I should mention that I am an ISTJ as well...

I'm curious about your methods of staying organized and formatting everything. I know ISTJs are labeled as ""the most organized type"" but everyone is different from one another. 

Also, this can be applied to things other than planners I suppose so do feel free to add other ways you stay organized.",1585548427

I‚Äôm 25, male dating an ISTJ, 32, also male.

For some reason my ISTJ starts to find my clumsiness and disorganization cute. I don‚Äôt even know why.
It‚Äôs already the seventh month we have dated.
So I‚Äôm certain it‚Äôs not pure infatuation that blinded him. And due to nature of INTP as well as my physical well-being, I can‚Äôt really comply with really strict workout routine. He used to lecture me on how I‚Äôm not putting enough efforts to achieve what body image I want to have but now he‚Äôs perfectly fine with the bit laid-back approach I do on workout routine. Like instead of a up down the slope jogging that supposed to increase the number of rounds overtime, we‚Äôve been just doing 10 rounds per day as we enjoy more time of feeling each other, chatting, hugging etc. 

I don‚Äôt know. Everything felt too good to be true.
How to tell if the ISTJ really loves me? Does watching stupid silly funny videos together count? Does sharing desserts count? He said he‚Äôs not a sweet tooth kind of person but he enjoys sharing it with Me, even buying popsicles time and time whenever he visits me and he would shove most of it to me. 

Lol he‚Äôs becoming like a father to me and I was told that it might not be a good idea when one partner becomes like a parental figure to another, even though it‚Äôs cute and romantic.

Has he been trying to tolerate me? He denied it on many occasions I asked. I‚Äôm just worried if he‚Äôs been tolerating me and one thing he will blow up. I know ISTJs have the tendency that‚Äôs why I kept asking time and time, I‚Äôll also observe too but it‚Äôs been alright...",1585500992

1. INTJ
2. ISTJ
3. INFJ

Now digging into the details:

* She likes to talk about the past
* She argues a lot (A LOT)
* She was a social butterfly in childhood, but in her teenager years, she slowly became introverted. She doesn't like to meet her family as well now (apart from very rare people). She started social distancing a while ago, and just spends her days now binging Netflix
* Self-deprecating; she is actually VERY pretty and smart, but thinks she isn't
* She doesn't know how to respond when someone praises her
* Hasn't opened up to anyone, not even her closest friends
* Admires me a lot and gives me compliments here and there
* She hasn't fallen for anyone in her life
* Her ideal type of guy should have the following qualities: Must touch her heart, have deep eyes (she has beautiful eyes and she says she wants a guy with eyes like hers), must not be dark skinned, must be mature and he shouldn't abuse/use cuss words.

\- I do everything first minute and rush through the task so I can get it over with to enjoy free time. I take shortcuts and care more about efficiency than perfect results. I'd rather spend little time just to get a B than a lot of effort to get an A. I usually do tradeoffs with friends for homework so we only need to finish half the assignment then copy the other half.

\- I have an extremeley terrible temper and have been to anger management classes. Often I get mad at the smallest things. I've gotten into many arguments, always confront people when I have an issue with them, and have ended friendships with multiple people throughout the years.

\- I hate rules and often don't listen to them. I've disobeyed teachers, talked back to authority, cheated on exams, stolen from a store, always use my phone in class, have gotten a truancy letter, and continued ditching class after a security caught me and reported me to a counselor.

\- My dream career is to be a professor because of the autonomy, freedom, and time flexibility. I want to be able to control all the decisions, make the rules, and work at any time I want. 

\- I come across as intimidating, serious, and quiet when first meeting. I talk less to people I'm less comfortable with and talk more to people who are more extroverted and easygoing even if I hardly know them.

\- I'm impatient and hate waiting for things. I used to have a hard time waiting even 2 minutes for a bus, but I'm better at waiting now. I'm often rushing because time is of an essence.

 I usually think I'm right about everything even without sufficient evidence.

\- I'm often arrogant and overestimate my abilities. I always think I score 100% on every test I take.

\- I'm usually just listening to music at home or watching Netflix, but if I had a group of friends I actually like, I would rather be busy outside doing things like karaoke, trying new restaurants, riding roller coasters, playing arcade games, going to concerts, and etc. I also like competitive video games.

\- I don't express my emotions besides anger, so I come across more cold than I actually am.

\- Some people have called me blunt, which could be another reason some people are intimidated by me. I speak in a direct way, have strong eye contact, and a resting bitch face. I don't smile much. Some people also say I walk aggressively.

\- I don't do anything to actively seek it out, but I enjoy attention. I like receiving compliments and people looking at me when I enter a classroom.

\- I find planning fun and have planned my entire course roadmap for my college classes when I'm only halfway through college.

\- I love thinking about the future and barely ever think of the past. Part of the reason I always think into the future is because I want complete control over how my future will turn out.

\- I'm responsible and have my shit together. I have all A's and am working a job related to my major (accounting).

\- I'm usually the group leader of projects because everyone else is too lazy or dumb to take charge. It's not that I want to be the leader; I simply just don't trust their leadership abilities. I'd prefer to get by doing nothing at all because I'm lazy.

\- My biggest pet peeves are who are disrespecting and having an attitude with me, people telling me what to do or giving me unsolicited advice, and wasting time.

\- People might find me boring because I don't have much of a sense of humor and mostly just stay at home.

\- People often tell me I'm confident like when I do presentations or interviews. 

\- My social skills aren't the best because sometimes I have nothing to say.

 I have a bad attention span. I'm often spacing out in class and sometimes don't pay attention to what people are saying to me.

ISTJ,"Here are some things about myself that are like and unlike a typical ISTJ:

I have habits but I'm not reluctant to make changes if I think the changes are likely beneficial. (e.g. my exercise routine, food I eatÔºåthe way I arrange my stuff, my daily environmentÔºåmy hobbies, etc.)

I have more respect for others than the average person

I respect rules but not all rules are just and necessary and I may neglect some rules depending on the likely results. 

In my opinion, the traditional way of doing things is likely to be superior if it is tried-and-tested, but I I'm not very reluctant if I see promise in a different way of doing things.

I take pride in being a productive and dependable person

I value honesty and impartiality

I can seem arrogant and overly confident in my abilities

I don't suffer from not being able to socialize due to quarantine, but I would prefer if I was still able to go to school to meet certain people more.

When it comes to art, fashion, etc. I typically judge it by how it looks

I acknowledge the fact that there are multiple ways and perspectives of doing things and seeing things, and try to determine which way is best.

I respect other people's beliefs and opinions unless the reason why seems irrational

I'm annoyed at those that use poor reasoning, and those who invade my personal space [e.g. I impulsively used my elbow to smash another persons arm when they (as a joke) spread it (the arm) on my personal desk as if to wipe their germs in my desk, even though I constantly tell them that it makes me umcomfortable]

I have above average memory, but my memories are not very detailed.

I sleep 7-9 hours a day, but when I sleep may vary depending on my schedule (e.g. when I have school the next day)

I'm a mild germaphobe. I don't share food when it can be potentially touched by others (chips is an exception). 

I dislike sports

I usually just listen instead of taking notes during class, and I sometimes don't listen and do other things if I consider listening as useless like when a teacher teaches things I already knew years ago.

When people share their judgement/opinion/ideas to me, I ask them why they think that way if I detect potential irrationality or poor reasoning in order to understand their view.

Being put up on-the-spot, and not being prepared is comfortable when it comes to tasks and large events.

I am disturbed when I make grammatical and spelling errors

I dislike people who lack independent thought, spread opinions without rationally explaining why, and those who can't see the perspective of anyone besides themselves.

I dislike people who refuse to accept that they're wrong, people who are bigots, and those who argue irrationally.

Strong sounds and lights easily disrupt my concentration

I can detect inconsistency in people's ideas/opinions/beliefs

I value results. I choose the process that is likeliest to fulfill my goal. But when judging or evaluating someone, I also analyze how they got the results and if the results were caused by very good/bad luck.

I just want someone who doesnt want to have children, who hates social constructs and conventions the same as me, that includes being extra picky with her friendships and hating crowds. I want a woman who isnt afraid of fighting hard for her dreams and who doesnt think about love as a hard, mystical experience. A team of the just the two of us, being alone together, at peace, doing whatever tf we want with our lives...

And yes, if i demand all of that is because i am more than capable to offer it as well, but the sad truth is most women are not interested in someone like me, or are taken or with the wrong person or whatever, and i am a decent human being. I am not even a ""nice guy tm"" nor an ""alpha"" or whatever. Just a human. Do i have to be superhuman to apply?

I am aware of this corona shit too lol, it is just that is have been like this for a very long time. I cant change who i am, even if i wanted. Any tips to make it happen? Altho most would say ""let it happen"", dude, be realistic. Oh, and another thing i have noticed is that if ever, the women i resonate the most have gone through very hard lives.

If you have, can you please tell **up to three** personality types (**excluding your own**) you like interacting with most and with which you prefer to spend your time with. Just the one you like the most.

**For example**:  
I am Enfp and I like XXXX, XXXX and XXXX the most 

\----&gt; you don¬¥t need to explain *why* you like them the most

Since the mbti community has 88k Members and the Enfp community alone has 42k members, I decided that I would post this post on each subreddit of each type because I want as much answers as possible. So sorry in advance if you might see this post more than once

And yes, I know that even within one personality type, the people differ, we are all individuals. But from my experience with people with different personality types I can say that, in general I liked a specific personality type more than an other.

I will be happy about receiving every comment anwering my question!! :))",1584995815
ISTJ,"This might not be the most MBTI post related ever but I figured it'd be interesting to get other ISTJ's perspective on the topic.

Personally, I've been observing a strict home stay for a week now and honestly despite what the memes about introverts say, it's pretty hard. I only went out yesterday to shop for groceries and that is all.

My gym closed and as an avid gym goer, that hit my routine hard. I found alternatives to exercise at home with bands, small weights etc, but I have yet to start.

I've also worked from home the past week and although I've executed a good amount of work, it's hard to get into it in the morning and get out of it in the evening. I like the office being a defining environment where ""work is to be done"", just like the gym is where you exercise and home is where you relax. Instead, this is all blurred into: ""do everything at home I guess"".

What is your experience?",1584883829
ISTJ,"Hi. I wanted to ask how Si builds our personality? Because of that it is an introverted function, it causes our internal world. So, can you please explain me?
I think, I am totally another person if we will compare me nowadays with me 2,5 years ago. So, people usually say that Si is very conservative, but I think Si is more like"" I have seen what I should do, and I will try to do it anyway"".But, as I understand, it happens uncomsciously, because if it was consiously, I would be less lazy and would start for to what I have to) 
So, what do you know about Si in personality? (I mean exactly ISTJ). Also I think, Si with Fi does a huge work in  making internal world unusual and individualistic",1584859206
ISTJ,"[I'll be short]
I am an intj male. And well, I have been among some istjs, as long as I remeber. I always had a super crush on them because of their hard-working spirit and well-mannered behaviour. (Thanks in advance for ignoring my typosüòÖ)
To be honest I had two screwed attempts for relationships with istjs. The first one was a 16 year old male classmate (when I was 16) and the second one was 20 year old girl in university. (And Yes I'm bi, but that doesn't mean I wasn't highly in love.)
And the only thing that I remember was arguing day and night over traditional things with cold-hearted and stone-headed people.
My first love was spoiled only on arguments with my boyfriend about homosexuality being immoral and causing HIV. (He has came out as gay recently) And the second time I fell in love was with a gorgeous classic girlfriend. and that one not even started! It was because of her rigid perceptions about boyfriend/girlfriend relationships  being immoral and humiliation for human dignity.
Actually my heart was broken badly each time and left me with the idea of ""Are most istj highly religious/traditional?"" Or It's just me, falling for the wrong people?
I hope if you agree with me or you are critical tell me your point of view in the comments.
Thanks alot!",1584849119

ISTJ,"I am an INFP female who has been talking (and flirting) with an ISTJ male coworker for the last month and a half. Unfortunately because of our different value systems I can‚Äôt see myself marrying him (there is no room for compromise on this), and therefore there is no point of dating or a relationship and I am going to tell him that tonight. 
Sadly, I am very attracted to him and based on what i‚Äôve read on every forum I could find about ISTJ attraction, I believe he definitely reciprocates. I am going the direct route and telling him as soon as I thought it was appropriate. I‚Äôm hoping he doesn‚Äôt feel like I wasted his time or led him on, it is very hard for me to act inauthentically (in classic INFP style) and act like I‚Äôm not attracted to him at work, because I definitely am. He is so grounding, and I love his company and feel so seen and appreciated by all the little things he does and remembers about me. 
I‚Äôve never been close to an ISTJ before (it‚Äôs wonderful by the way, you guys are awesome). If I know he‚Äôs going to take it better than me it‚Äôll help me hurt for just myself and not for both of us so much. If not, that‚Äôs okay too, I‚Äôd just like to know what to expect.
Am I right to expect him to shut me out or act more distant going forward working together because he knows there‚Äôs no romantic future with me? Is remaining friends completely out of the question?

TLDR: we are both attracted to each other but I can‚Äôt pursue a relationship. How can I expect him to react so it softens the blow? 

Thanks guys.",1584824748
ISTJ,"Hey! I'm an INTJ, and honestly ISTJs are one of my favorite personality types. You guys are so reliable and consistent. I really love your practicality and how down-to-earth you are. You're very organized and neat too, which I appreciate as a hyper-organized INTJ. I like that our types are similar and share our middle two functions and can connect that way, but see things from very different perspectives that can help each other to see the world in a different way. 

Two of my closest friends are ISTJs, and I feel like they can sometimes get annoyed at my tendency to have my head in the clouds in intuitive land. Neither of them are really interested or get MBTI things though, so I was curious, what do you guys think of INTJs?",1584820523
ISTJ,"A few days ago I was watching C.S. Josephs video about direct vs informative. https://youtu.be/I8fSV_9zjms

What do you think about this theory? 

I would never tell anyone to go get milk or inform them that we're out of milk. Rather I'd go get the milk myself or if it's more convenient because someone in the household is near the store I would ask them. That's what my parents teached me and I brought that politeness with me.",1584782846
ISTJ,"In short: He doesn't like me romantically.

Now, the conversation went really well. And when I say that, I mean it went so well that he hugged me (twice, on his own accord) and told me he cares about me and told me that I am very close to him.

When I told him, I really had no expectations, I was just being honest with him because I felt like guessing the meaning behind his every word or move would be unfair to him. So I just wanted him to know. I also told him I won't be distancing myself away from him, I'll just shift my perspective on how I view him since I have closure now. He agreed that we would remain friends and nothing would change from his side behaviour wise.

He also said he feels very comfortable with me so he can shed his needles (so to speak) and just be himself and show his vulnerabilities. He feels good letting me in. I said I am glad he feels that way and I would never do anything to hurt him. We also discussed his texting habits and he said that it's not me, he is just BAD at texting people back.

We discussed the fact that if at any point his feelings change with respect to being friends then I would prefer that he be upfront with me about it instead of phasing himself out of my life. I am so glad I had this conversation with him because we obviously are able to navigate a tough conversation with ease. And moreover, I feel like some unspoken barrier has been crossed now that makes the friendship stronger. I know I always have a friend in him and that he is reliable and caring. Basically, this is the next best possible outcome.

ISTJ,"So I've always typed as ISTJ on every single test I've taken. But everyone portrays ISTJs as ""never having emotions"" and ""robotic"" almost. I'm not good at dealing with my or other's emotions, but I have been described as a very emotional person. Dealing with my mental health has caused me to experience my emotions very deeply with depressive lows and euphoric highs.

I'm bad at helping others on an emotional level since I feel awkward doing so. But I'm a pretty emotionally expressive person.

ISTJ,"So working from home can be a very interesting experience. There are countless distractions and it can pretty hard to get in the headspace to actually do the work

During this time that we are all social distancing and working from home, everything that is happening in the world can make it tough to focus. I just kept finding it hard to even start the work that I was supposed to and ultimately ended up procrastinating for far too long.

So I tried using the classic Pomodoro Technique. Some of you may know this, but its principles of using quick bursts of output and regular intervals were exactly what I needed given the environment that many of us are working in.

My simple process was

* Choose a task
* Set the Pomodoro to 25 minutes
* Work on the task until the Pomodoro rings
* When the timer rings, take a short break (5 mins)
* After 4 ‚ÄúPomodoros‚Äù, take a longer break (15-30)

This was so so helpful to me and I think that this indefinite time being spent at home can actually be put to good use now.

My boyfriend and I have been together for roughly four years now and I have begun to notice more and more that he is overly affectionate and clingy. It drives me absolutely insane! He always has to be touching me in some way or another, regularly mouths ""I love you!"" to me and/or does a kissing motion with his lips regardless of who is in the room if he thinks they aren't looking, he will literally hold me all night long whenever he stays over, wants to always be beside me and expects a lot of texts on daily basis otherwise he gets upsets if I don't text him within an hour or so. This is all I can think of right now.

ISTJ,"Do your texting habits differ between friends vs people you have a crush on?

I have been trying to establish a text conversation with the ISTJ from my other posts and our in person interactions remain pretty great and keep improving however, he is just horrible at responding to my texts or even talking with me over text. I have actually indirectly called him out on how he fails to respond but with no luck.

On the flip side, with one of our colleagues who he goes to class with, he does text her and chat with her normally over text. I should mention that she is not single, she is getting engaged soon.

ISTJ,"Hello, big fan here.

My S/O ISTJ have a relative that passed away and the funeral's today. He cried when they passed and have expressed his grief. Yesterday (very last minute.. for some reason) we found out that the funeral would be held today. I've asked him several times of he'd want me to come with him (I have to work today but could make changes so that I would be able to come with him). He says that it doesn't matter, if I want I can but he says that it's not perticularly necessary. I would like to be there for him, especially if he'll need it, but if it's truly not something that he'll need I'd feel like I'm imposing on something that really doesn't have to do with me other than me being there to support him.

I know that in the moment he means what he says but one thing that makes me unsure of whether or not he might actually appreciate me coming with him after all has to do with an incident that has happened before. He works with taking care of the elderly, some times his own relatives. One day he were assigned to help with a relative that had passed away, a quite distant one but nonetheless a hard task for a relative to do, which entail seeing the body, etc.

My sister work with him and had called him to ask if he wanted her to go with him. He said no, he'd be fine. She still went to assist him. He later expressed to me that he appreciated that.

What do you guys think? Should I go? Does he know what he might feel and need beforehand? I know that he have a hard time picturing things beforehand.

I have no problem going with him, I'd actually prefer it just in case he'd have a hard time. There will be close family members there which might be support enough for him. As I said, I've asked him a couple of times and assured him that it's not a hassle nor a problem for me at all.",1584434079

ISTJ,"Jung said that Extroversion is objective and Introversion is subjective.
So that makes Si the subjective aspect of our senses. This would be what our brain tells us is pleasant/comfortable and what is unpleasant/uncomfortable.Therefore, those who lead with Si are motivated by a desire to maximize pleasant sensations and are avoident of things that risk losing these comforts. Being Introverted in nature, Si types are more leaning towards the avoident side of this spectrum. That's why i think they tend to favor establishing routines and traditions.

People say I'm pretty straightforward. They also say I look meek, innocent and serious. In spite of how I look, I'm pretty stubborn, I hate people telling me what to do, I do what I want to do. I am quite calm, I don't get angry easily. I have problems expressing my negative feelings, I often bottle up my anger and hold grudges. If someone crosses the line, I get distant instead of solving the problem. 

I love watching people, nature, animals, world in general. There is something mesmerizing about it. I find everything very artsy. I can find the beauty in almost anything and I usually have a positive and hopeful outlook.

I don't know if that will help but my dad is ISTJ, mom is ISFJ, sister is ISFP and my brother is ISTJ. Well, my brother is still 12 year old but I can sense it in him.

People think I'm socially awkward and I don't like it. I hear things like ""You're not social but at least you adapt to people around you."". I love being lonely but when it gets too long, like a weekend long, I get so sad and hopeless and desperately want school back.

Most of my friends are ENFJs and ENFPs, I have so much fun with them.

I love nostalgia and old things.

I take the lead willingly and I would very much like to save a project from dead end. It's like a challenge and it does not matter if I fail because I believe that I will do better if I keep trying. Giving up is not an option for me. I fight until the end.

I don't know since when I feel this way, but in the last few weeks I recognised that I am kind of disconnected from the world.

During my whole day, I never feel really bad, and I never feel really good. I do have fun moments with friends, and I do laugh and feel good, but on the question: 'Am I really happy?' I could not honestly say yes. I cannot pinpoint since when this is the case, because I had a very happy childhood, and nothing really bad happened to me (actually I did very well, I worked very hsrd for everything, I finished my study, got a good job... got basically everything I set my goals for), but its at least a few years like this now, slowly getting more. 

The one thing I am missing is feelings, for something. I havent said to my parents that I love them since I was a child. They are very precious to me, but as of how I am now, I could not honestly say that,because the deep feeling is not there. I have said to my (Ex-)Girlfriends that I love them, but now I am sure that it was at least not true love. 

Coming to my own feelings, I do feel a lot, but somehow not about things that are in my environment. When I am alone, watching a sad movie, I really feel the emotions, and I cry a little on joyfull or very sad scenes. Also specific music that brings up memories can invoke strong feelings in me. 

But i cannot just ""let go"" on anything that relates to me personaly. I have moments where I would love to just feel sad and cry, but it doesn't happen. The best I can give is a 'sad numbness'. 
And the fun moments seem to be superficial. 

Currently it feels like living from day to day (although I have a readmap for my next years planned) , and there is nothing I really deeply care about (altough there should be many things) .

This is something I have thought about a lot over the past few years, and especially the last few days after my mom called me. Let me explain: 

I hug family and friends when I meet them because they hug. Those who don't open their arms and lean in for any kind of hug won't get one. 
I never tell people: ""I love you"" or ""I care about you"" unless they say it first, like my mom do every single time we talk or meet. I have at least one friend who also say it almost every time. Luckily we don't meet or talk too often. Every single time someone say it it totally weirds me out. 
I understand that some have the need to say it, but I just can't get used to it. 

I can be very affectionate with a partner when it's new, but I don't need to be on top of each other all the time. But for all the practical reasons I prefer staying single and have been for six years. Less heartbreaks as well. 

Even my little one tell me they love me more often than I say it first. Now, they are at that age where sitting still is no longer an option so we are way past the holding them in my arms until they fall asleep. So a hug and/or a kiss when I drop them off in the morning and a little ritual before bedtime which includes a hug and saying ""I love you"".

ISTJ,"So I recently started a new job and I realize that people are getting negative vibes from me mainly for two reasons.

Reason 1: I come off as a ""know it all."" I like to see the big picture AND every detail in between. I want to know not just how my department works and is supposed to function, in addition to other departments. This is mostly to see how all departments are interconnected and why my job, specifically, is important. The downfall is that if I see other departments or even my manager doing something ""incorrectly"" or not according to protocol, I call them out and tell them the ""right"" way to do things. I know this makes me a micromanager. How do I let things go and just mind my own business? 

Reason 2: When someone tells me to do something, such as my manager, I will absolutely do it. But before I do, I want to know WHY we're supposed to do it (again, so I know why it's important). I am finding, however, that my asking ""why"" is coming off as combative and like I'm pushing back and not wanting to do what I am told. I know this is because of how I approach asking why. I am very direct and usually respond by saying something like, ""Okay, but why? Because we do x and y, so if condition z is already met, why is what you're telling me to do necessary?""

I guess my biggest concern is that I am coming off as stubborn and like my shit doesn't stink. As many know, ISTJs are little to no emotion and straight to the point. How can I present myself in a way that this mentality/approach comes off as a strength, rather than a weakness?",1583893767

ISTJ,"Hi ISTJs,

Can I have your advice please?

I am an ISFJ (25) and he is an ISTJ (30). A year ago, I developed a feeling to an ISTJ and felt that he likes me too so I confessed my feelings to him. He did not reply on my confession for 2 months so I tried to talk to him personally but he run away. Haha. A week after trying to personally discuss with him, he messaged me that I was just a little sister to him. 

However, due to some circumstance which kept our communication every week, my feelings got deeper. I know that I am too caring and concerned if it concerns him. I am not sure if he is aware of this but I think my friends has a little idea but are just silent about it. 

Whenever we have gatherings, I know myself that I tend to just look at him. Hehe. Probably I look attentive and interested whenever he speaks which is why he also prefers to look at me. When someone in our group is talking, he looks at that person but my eyes are still on him. 

Lately, I think his nervous and he looks at me then looks away then he's going to look at me again and I will take my eyes off him. **Am I making him uncomfortable? Will you let someone know if they make you uncomfortable?**

I am not sure if he developed feelings for me but he still acts the same before which made me conclude that he liked me before. One time while we were hanging out, our friend told me that she will introduce me with her friend who's looking for a girlfriend. He suddenly but in and said that the guy is not qualified on my number 1 list of boyfriend ( I am a little surprised that he remembered). Probably, he wants to help me find a boyfriend in accordance with my list. Haha. Then, last night he said that I should take care because I will go  in a place where I might get some sickness. Do I need to do something to make him tell me what's happening?

P.S I was very consistent sending sweet messages to him and sharing what's happening in my life. Haha. Sometimes he responds, sometimes he won't. 

Sorry for the long post guys. Really appreciate your response. :)",1583837010

9) do you like sports?

10) how much do you care about traditions sort of thing... If yes , what does it usually take for you to change it or change the way to see it?? - do you do it frequently or is it rare ?

11) Was your mind blown by the Dark Knight movie ? :D

12) Do you when you encounter an interest in something , look more into it ? Or leave it just be? ( I guess many people look more into it ..I suppose ...but perhaps it also depends on how much importance you assign to it. )

With the new year and decade, I wanted to really give my everything to all the things that I wanted to accomplish. But there were so many things that I wanted that I couldn't focus on any of them.

I tried Warren Buffett's 5/25 rule, which essentially required you to list down 25 things that you wanted to accomplish in the foreseeable future. Nothing was off the table.

Next, you have to rank your top 5 in order of importance and circle them. This is super hard because you have to decide what's most meaningful to you.

The 20 remaining items became a list of items to avoid. But the truth is that due to their lesser importance, I realized that they were only taking away my commitment to the things that mattered most to me.

This was so so helpful to me and I think that I may actually have a shot of accomplishing the things I want to now. If you're struggling with this, I really think you should give it a shot.

I have some questions though because given the context of how we met (at work), there is a risk associated with this confession.

1. I was thinking I would wait until I graduate (this May) and if nothing has happened by then I would confess my feelings. This seems to be the min risk option from the POV of keeping harmony at the workplace.
2. Alternatively, I can tell him how I feel after I have initiated/offered hanging out outside of work so that we can both see how we get along outside of a work setting.
3. And finally, I can tell him how I feel like maybe next week after I have plucked up the courage.

Which option would you suggest I follow?

Now, given the outcome that he does not feel the same way, how much do you think our dynamic would change? Would you sacrifice a friendship if a friend told you they liked you but you did not like them back?

I was talking a lot with an ENFP man. I'm an ISTJ female. We were talking a lot by texting to eachother, very rarely IRL. We are very different. My goal is to be confortable in life and just have a nice day to day life. I like to to take care of myself. Im a bit snob compared to him. He is the kind that wants to travel the world. He doesnt take care of himself a lot. 

This week he sended me a screenshot of a plane ticket and told me that he was going to travel with his ex. My first reaction was to be very jealous. We never talked about our feeling to eachother. I got pretty upset and I decided to tell him that I liked him. I got scared.

He answered that he liked me too. I got very happy fast and I shared a lot a detail of what I was thinking (I never do that) about him and other people. 

Suddenly, I got very stressed out. Like very bad. I didnt know why. Maybe the fear of commitment? The fear of unknowed? I thought maybe it was because I needed to tell my friends about what just happen. So I told them and it didnt change. After, I decided to talk to my mom. I felt a bit better, but I was still feeling a lot of stress. 

I felt like I was loosing a part of myself by trying to date that guy. It felt wrong. Like it wasnt a good idea. I wasn't confortable. 

Yesterday, he wanted to see me. So we went to a gaming bar (because we both like gaming). It was sooooo boring. I got so bored. I felt so out of place. I was just thinking of leaving. 

I felt like a dumbass, because I accepted to date him... and like 12h after it felt like a huge mistake. I wanted to run away, go to my house and sleep in my bed. I just realised that we really didnt fit together. 

After the bar, I told him i've changed my mind. We talked way too much by text and not face to face. The guy in front of me wasnt the same guy I was texting in my head. He really didnt understood my reaction. He was shocked. He didnt understand why i've change my mind so fast. 

I was just thinking that we didnt fit together. I didnt saw him in my futur. We dont have the same lifegoal.

Everything was so rush because of my jealousy. And I didnt took a step back to think about it. I feel like a dumbass and i hurted his feeling. 

For now, I just want to desappear and take care of myself. My reaction was so weird and it really didnt feel like me. I was someone else for that week.

Things initially were great, but after the honey moon phase and a bit of cohabitation, the incompatibility become much more apparent.

Now, one would think that I would be approaching this with apprehension, but I care more about the individual character than the 4 letters.

ISTJ,"Howdy folks. I am an ESTP and I have trouble identifying and explaining Si and Te to people because they‚Äôre not in my function stack. Figured this would be a good place to try and understand them better.

Here‚Äôs how I operate: My Se is constantly looking to travel to the next activity, whatever that might be (preferably something exciting and new with lots of sensory input). It focuses heavily on my actions and the actions of others. I use my secondary Ti knowledge-database to collect and store facts which weigh the likely outcomes of those actions, and, if I‚Äôm so inclined, to direct action toward a desired outcome. Tertiary Fe schmoozes the right people along the way to expedite processes and produce desired result quicker, and/or seeks to invites friends to share in the fun experience. Repressed Ni is trying to look directly ahead to gauge what myself or others should do next.

ISTJ,"This is going to be complicated...

     My mom is an INFP and my dad is an ISTJ. (I had my dad take a personality test today and he matches perfectly with ISTJ, and my mom took a personality test a while ago and INFP continues to resonate with her.) Since I found out both of their types, many of the reasons why they fight (personality-wise) have become clearer. I knew they were different, but I didn‚Äôt know they were *this* different ‚Äî they share exactly zero cognitive functions, save for introversion. My mom is more of a talker, more of a feeler, and definitely more sensitive than my dad. My dad is more of a doer, less emotionally-motivated, and can seem rough and tumble (emotionally) compared to my mom‚Äôs soft INFP outlook. These are only a few of the things that make them very different from each other, but there is one thing that I think they still share ‚Äî love. I want to help them bring out this love and let it motivate everything they do, because I can‚Äôt stand this fighting anymore and I know they can‚Äôt either.

     Things are really shaky in their relationship right now, but I feel like their relationship isn‚Äôt irreparable. Pardon my INFJ jargon, but I feel like there is room for them to grow and understand each other, but some of the trouble is, they don‚Äôt try very hard to talk things through. Oftentimes they start fighting because my dad says something slightly rash that my mom feels like disagreeing with (for example, taking me on a drive to California to get my driving hours in). My mom will then start yelling and aggressively asserting her point of view without even trying to understand his reasoning. But when that happens, my dad just starts spewing nonsense and irritating her even more. This all happens so fast that I can never see it coming, so I can‚Äôt really do anything to stop it. But, I was talking to my dad today, telling him what ticks my mom off and giving him marriage advice (I‚Äôm literally a high schooler. Idk what I‚Äôm doing, but it seems to be working), and with this direct sort of talk he really understood all the things he does wrong, and also why she does some of the things she does. But I want to get deeper than this and break down any walls they have put up in front of each other. Should I have a conversation with both of them? What will help break the walls?

    Another big difference they have is work issues. My dad, admittedly, is a workaholic. Probably more so than most ISTJ‚Äôs are. My mom has a job, too, but she is increasingly using it as an escape from us. For years my dad had to commute and we‚Äôd only see him 2 days out of the week. It had a really big strain on our family, which is probably part of the reason why we are the way we are now. My mom really resents my dad for being away so often. He also had bad reasons for being away (when he was an alcoholic he‚Äôd always want to be away from my mom because it made him angry). I don‚Äôt resent him for it anymore, but my mom does, as one might imagine. This is probably because she knew that he was trying to avoid her, which I understand. Adult relationships seem to be pretty complex. 

     Anyways, my dad isn‚Äôt commuting anymore, but he might have to soon (and all the way to Seattle) because his jobs are almost finished here in NV. I‚Äôm worried that if he does ‚Äúcommute‚Äù, that commute will turn into him renting a place and being away all the time, to stay away from my mom. That‚Äôs only if things don‚Äôt get fixed. Time is running out and I really think we should find somewhere to rent in California so he can work in the Bay Area and Sacramento and all of that. But - moving might destroy the last fibers of their relationship if things stay the same. I need to try and help them fix this before it‚Äôs too late. So, other than the obvious ‚ÄúISTJ should be more sensitive to INFP‚Äù and ‚ÄúINFP should be more direct with ISTJ‚Äù, what advice do you have to help my parents get along better so we don‚Äôt have to live like this?

ISTJ,"Hi, 

I am an INFJ who happens to find herself in a situation where I am attracted to an ISTJ coworker. We are both pursuing the same degree at our university and we work together at our part time job.

Recently our dynamic has evolved to more than workmates and borders on friendship. I have been observing his behaviour and this is what I have found so far : 

Trust: he seems to trust me a tad more than the other people around him since he will often share private news with me and wants to know my opinion on things 

Goofy/playful: our friendship started as banter where we both are ‚Äúmean‚Äù to each other. But it‚Äôs not serious at all, we are both joking. He‚Äôs very sassy and mean to me in a playful fashion and will tease me a lot. He was also in a goofy mood a few days ago and was very playful 

Curious about my life: he keeps track of things happening in my life and asks me about them. He also takes care to stay in the loop.

Physical touch: he‚Äôs very comfortable with making physical contact with me (knees/arms touching when we are sitting next to each other, casual physical interactions like touching my hand etc). Now, personally I‚Äôm not a touchy person so this is a bit unusual to me from a purely co worker POV, however I understand other people may be different. 

Is this enough information to discern he might be interested? Or is this how an ISTJ would treat a god friend?

ISTJ,"Just tryna keep things short as possible but: it's been for 7 months now where we've had this on-going limbo/ grey area relationship where theres clearly sexual/ emotional (romantic) attraction between the both of us, we both care for each other and we connect as people. 

The main reasons he doesn't want to date is he claims he doesn't feel that intangible emotional ""pull"" towards me and says while he knows we connect intellectually/ he likes me for xyz reasons, he says he needs that strong emotional pull also in order to commit. 
Essentially, he's saying if he's not 100% sure, then he doesn't want to commit as he sees dating as considering the end possibility of marriage as well- so dating is a serious thing for him. 

So essentially I've been ""waiting"" things out and ""going with the flow"" with of course this ""dating or not"" conversation popping up every so often. Before I hear any ""you should stop wasting your time"" or ""move on"", I have my very complicated reasons/ observations:

1) Being that he has had no dating experience/ experienced essentially all his firsts with me/ I question how in touch he is with the concept of dating/ his feelings. I've been trying to bring a different perspective to him but I am well aware that ISTJ's are quite adamant about what they believe to be true or not. Of course everyone is entitled to their own perspectives but I see the possibility? Even then, I'm not so sure if he fully stands by his words as there are times when he even questions ""are we dating?""- as if he's throwing around the idea/ possibility. So I wonder sometimes if he is suppressing his emotions from POTENTIALLY developing over time with his logic-based reasoning of ""I don't want date."" As an ISFP, it's hard for me to see how someone could be so certain of their future/ leave an open mind because tbh, i don't think anybody knows what will happen in the future. 
Also, for the longest time, his actions seem to contradict his words, supported by the mere fact we are still engaging in romantic activity. Additionally, we are both virgins so I think him using me for sex is the last concern. 

2) No, he's not interested in anyone else. He has a very small friend circle, and if anything, I'm probably the closest friend/most legit friend he has on campus. Also, half the time, he's too busy studying and whatnot. 

3) Realistically, I think for him to consider anyone to date, he'd probably have to know the person decently well for at least a year+. But also realistically, the chances of him making a first move are close to 0.  I know I sound biased and doubtful of his ability to make close relationships but I guess I'm trying to convince him to take all opportunities that come your way before you regret not taking them (that's my pov as an ISFP) 

Background info: we did ""technically"" date for a very short time (a week after our first romantic interactions, we decided to date) but that may have been a result of jumping the bandwagon too quickly for both of us (we spent our time together almost 24/) and I assume for an ISTJ, he wouldn't do that if he wasn't blinded by the mere excitment of something new/ that probably was overwhelming for him as someone who values his independence/ alone time. However, tying back to 1), even after he told me he wanted to take things down a notch and essentially ""stop dating"", his actions would suggest otherwise.  

Obviously we don't do certain things like we did when we were dating like PDA and etc, there's still signs here and there that suggest he regards me in a more meaningful manner than he claims. 

This is obviously a lot a lot of jumbled info to process and I don't doubt if I'm missing info. 

WITH THAT SAID: 

1) I wonder whether I should attribute all these things to immaturity/ lack of experience/ knowledge and thus wait for another year or so? Last thing I want is to ruin something that has potential/ friendship- and additionally, I don't think I'd be/ or am missing out on too many ""other dating chances"" either given my personality (ISFP)/ who I am.

If this continues for another year, I most likely will be moving on but for the time being, present, what should I do? It would be such a pitty to give up on something with potential. Maybe another reason I really value/ want to hold onto this relationship w him is because I've experienced many firsts with him as well and I've never felt this comfortable with anybody/ didn't think I'd be accepted in that way for a very long time.",1581287886

The way I understand it, being a sensor means gathering information mainly through the senses. Stability also seems to be an underlying theme of Introverted Sensing. The problem with the mbti community it seems, is that they attribute anything slightly intellectual to the intuitive functions. A lot of people think reading is an intuitive's activity. Although, I figured, reading is actually a sensor's activity. Combine stability with this and it looks to me like xSxJs are trying to re-create a ""best"" experience or, preserving that ""best"" experience. An xSxJ doesn't necessarily have to experience the event themself though. It's possible that they seek to re-create a ""best"" experience if they have read, heard, or watched about it.",1581151455

ISTJ," Hello!

I wanted to see your thoughts as to whether this guys personality sounds like an ISTJ. I meet him¬†last semester standing in line for food at my campus dining hall. He approached me and said he had seen me around and thought he would say hi. He asked me what my major was, and¬†after I told him said he had just switched to mine.¬†We talked for a few more minutes and exchanged names. Due to me being a shy/very introverted person,¬†something like that would normally bother me, but he did nothing that made me feel uncomfortable and it was not creepy in the slightest. The rest of that semester, we would say hi if we saw each other, and on one occasion we talked for a while. Fast forward to this semester, and I have seen him a few different times where we have been able to talk for extended periods.

Some main traits he has:

* He is extremely introverted... I have no idea why he even approached me that first time, but since knowing him I have never seen him have a conversation with anyone else besides me (of course I don‚Äôt see him at all times)
* He gives of classic lone wolf vibes, but is very nice once you talk with him
* Always alone
* Comes off as unapproachable¬†(he will sit in an isolated spot with his hat on and hoodie up) but once¬†I initiate, he is very nice and seems happy to talk
* Is guarded and raw at the same time
* While I am usually the one asking most of the questions, he will ask me some as well
* Remembers everything I have told him, and will bring it up in conversation
* Is oddly open with his feeling... he has told me things that I consider to be personal and I wouldn‚Äôt expect someone like him to feel comfortable with
* Sometimes there are a few seconds of silence when we are talking but it does not make me feel like he wants me to leave, it more just feels like we are both awkward
* Owns about 5 hoodies haha
* Seems to be very logically, yet at times can be in tuned with his emotions
* Has fairly strong opinions about things and is okay to voice them

ISTJ,"Well, hi fellow ISTJs. I come from another side of the dimension, the land of INTPs.

Was just wondering how do you ISTJs see us INTPs.
I know it might have been on the subreddit for ages but well, there might be updates you know. We INTPs are also like computer unit, just ... maybe on the software side, you guys are maybe on the hardware (get things done) side LOL.

Anyway, apart from that, I‚Äôm currently dating an ISTJ. It‚Äôs been five months since we are together. And ... well, not to stereotype my own MBTI but I really suck at thinking, I sometimes just went ‚Äúdo I really love him? Wait how do I justify if I don‚Äôt love him?‚Äù and go for checklist when obviously I know that‚Äôs not how love works. There‚Äôs no checklist. Can ISTJs tell if the person is seriously in love and not acting with them? 

I think you guys can ... it‚Äôs always just me thinking that maybe I didn‚Äôt love him enough but in actuality I did, a lot. Like I do say I love you and even the cheesy lines from Boys‚Äô Love even though I felt guilty for not exactly feeling every word I uttered when it happens... but I said it regularly, somehow, for some reason, it just comes out, I don‚Äôt know why. 

Anyway it‚Äôs nice to know you guys.",1580118036

ISTJs fascinate me and quite a lot. One thing I've noticed for a while now, is them dividing into like two subtypes  - idk if it's about culture, but my Asian ISTJ friends tend to be a lot more social than western(Northern European) friends, former hanging out in a 3-4 person groups almost every day compared to the latter just joining maybe once or twice a week to a bigger gathering.

I don't really want to pry into my friends' decisions too much to not make them uncomfortable - they already see me as quite intimidating/annoying when I get super curious about something -, so I hope some of you could help a bit.",1580048528

ISTJ,"  

First I was an INFJ, and felt quite like one. I am fine having grown out of being an INFJ though. Then I became an ENFP when I started liking engaging with people a whole lot more (extraverted) and became a bit reckless socially. Recently, I‚Äôve become cynical and do not trust everyone as easily as the ENFP would (with their blinding acceptance of everyone). So that might have contributed to getting a dominant sensitive function. But now I can't help but feel that anyone with good confidence and a strong sense of organization and responsibility is categorized into the ISTJ. Or that someone who is excessively bubbly when interacting with others is an ENFP. Or that someone who keeps to themselves and has a hidden world within is an INFJ. Does anyone else feel like mbti results are based off of one or another specific quality that you might possess at the time being? 

Regarding being an ISTJ now, I know they are stereotyped as not having excessive interest in life, being too repetitive and having no goals, but that is literally the opposite of me. I think what people fail to realize is that people can give their lives structure not because they are not fond of excitement and challenges, but because that is the best method for constant self-improvement.

Reading the subs of INFJ, ENFP and ISTJ, I feel like I am an amalgamation of all three. I feel like an INFJ when I am going through a sensitive or sentimental period of time or if I connect with someone deeply and form a satisfying friendship. I feel like an ENFP when I interact with people in real life and form relationships. I feel like an ISTJ when I am by myself and working on something systematically.

This took years to write, but sorry for this aimless ramble. I just wanted to let the internet know about this and was wondering what other people‚Äôs personality changes have been and if they have been as dramatic as mine or even more so. 

Tldr; how can someone go from an INFJ to an ENFP to an ISTJ? And how can I often feel all three at once? What have your mbti changes been?",1579995622

i've always preferred email or long text if there's something i want to convey to someone. anything written and professional to some degree. it's organized, i say what i need to say, there's no accidental words said in the heat of the moment, and people can sort of take it in and think before responding instead of immediately being defensive like how they would in conversation.

but recently, my brother has been making a point to say things in person, ever since some girl told him ""i can't believe you just told me all that through text"" and his friends agreed with the girl. this is just kinda weird for me and it's been on my mind a lot. i don't know if i'm the weird one or if my brother just has weird teenager friends.

ISTJ,"So there's an istj guy I've been interested in for some time. I'm an infj. The first time we actually met, he came up to me to talk. But he was visibly nervous and asked a bunch of logistical questions while smiling very hard (questions which I knew not the answer to but still tried to help with). After 6 months of being formal and friendly to each other the nature of our acquaintanceship oscillates between him staring from a distance at me/being distantly polite/saying hi very robotically/ etc. and then talking about his family/his plans and dreams/being warm/offering help/trying hard to talk to me. As for me, because I am nervous and second guess myself, I oscillate between being warm/thoughtfully inquisitive and also being serious/aloof/focusing on getting work done. He struggles with asking questions that engage my enthusiasm as they're mainly centered around logistics rather than existential or colorful, silly ones like my ENTP and ENFJ friends/colleagues. 

So.... I was just wondering (1) if this is normal??? (2) What can be done to bring him out of this bout of oscillation? (3) Is it normal that his email responses take eons and are rather short? (4) Does it mean anything that he goes out of his way to try and provide help?

Finally, seeing as I am no longer taking classes with him and because he's a lab rat... I doubt I'll see him as much. (5) How could I lure him out of the regular workplace?

Last night we went out for a casual date night to see Jumanji and eat at Steak n Shake. We were waiting for our bill and I asked him if he would mind having a relationship talk sometime this weekend. He said, ‚ÄúYeah, go ahead.‚Äù I asked if he was sure since we were sitting at the Steak n Shake in public, and he said it was fine. 

I awkwardly told him that we talk about our future together a lot but we haven‚Äôt really discussed marriage lately, and I was just wondering if there was anything holding him back or goals he wanted to accomplish first, or reservations about us. 

He told me that he has zero reservations about us and that he loves me and wants to marry me, but he doesn‚Äôt know how to do it. I wasn‚Äôt sure what he meant by that, so I asked him. He told me that he doesn‚Äôt have many friends (it‚Äôs true...neither of us does. We are each other‚Äôs best friend and both of us have childhood friends we talk to only sporadically because we live so far away and never see them). And he also doesn‚Äôt have a career (he makes money in non-traditional but legal ways, but it isn‚Äôt really a job. It is more of a good-paying hobby). He got a little teary when he talked about that, so I told him we don‚Äôt need to talk about it anymore. But he continued anyway. 

He told me that marriage wouldn‚Äôt change anything about our relationship. It wouldn‚Äôt affect his level of commitment to me in any way. I agreed and told him the same. I also told him that having a traditional wedding isn‚Äôt important to me (he had mentioned ‚Äútraditional wedding‚Äù when we talked about his lack of friends). I also told him I don‚Äôt even want to get married right away because I would like to be engaged for a year or two anyway. 

The conversation was a little bit awkward, but I expected it to be. I explained how much courage it took for me to bring it up, and he told me he wants me to always feel as though I can tell him anything. 

Overall, it was very positive. I don‚Äôt expect a ring anytime soon, but I was able to voice my opinion and explain my occasional relationship anxiety, and I feel confident that it will happen when he is ready. I won‚Äôt be rushing him or bringing it up again because I know now that it isn‚Äôt that he doesn‚Äôt want to get married but that he has to figure some things out for himself. It really was the best possible outcome! Thank you to those who gave me advice.",1579468842

I‚Äôm in no rush to actually do the deed, but I would like to get engaged. It has been consuming my thoughts lately, so I would like to bring the subject up again to see if he has a timeline or something else (like certain goals he wants to reach first, etc.) in mind.

Child care provider here, and I hate it. I‚Äôve been doing it for a decade, and I‚Äôm all the negative words ‚Äî burnt out, exhausted, bored, miserable. 

My last post I got some great feedback into things to look into, but I haven‚Äôt quite found something that seems like a decent fit yet. 

Gonna try to keep it simple this time. 

What I‚Äôm looking for in a career basically boils down to:

1. Working with info, not so much people
2. Something I can do remotely eventually 
3. No travel
4. Bachelor‚Äôs degree or less required to break into the field

A bit about me: I don‚Äôt do well at all under pressure; I work well when I have time and space to think through things. I enjoy quiet. I want to actually get to use my brain at work ‚Äî child care is utterly mind numbing ‚Äî but I also enjoy the routine of being able to do some things by rote. 

Do you guys have any suggestions for me? I‚Äôve gone through all sorts of ISTJ career lists, but they all say the same things, and I know there has got to be more jobs out there than that in such a large world. 

Thanks in advance!",1578795318

I‚Äôm an INTJ. I have an ISTJ buddy and we click so well. We have very similar philosophies, issues, and desires.

**Some random traits I have:** 

\- With regards to food I care only about how healthy &amp; nutritious it is, don't mind eating bland bitter shit as long as it's serving my purpose

\- I freak out when people look at what i'm doing (Example: i'm watching something on Youtube and my brother is getting into my room like ""wHaT ARe yOu WaTChINg?"").   
I don't want people to see what i'm doing, unless i specifically want to share something

\- I don't mind doing the dishes, cleaning and stuff like that

\- I like creating routines for myself but i don't always follow them

\- I love making documents and writing lists

ISTJ,"I‚Äôve taken the Myers-Briggs test a few times throughout my life and I‚Äôm pretty sure I get ISTJ the most. I have also been typed as ISFJ, INTJ, ISTP, and INFJ. I‚Äôm pretty positive I‚Äôm an introvert. The test I took gave a scale for the opposing traits of each category. S/N varies each time but I consistently get about 50% for both T/F and J/P. So here‚Äôs a little about me...

I am loyal to people and my promises. I care about helping solve the problems of those close to me and I always want to be helpful. Something that is very important to me is that what I do is recognized an appreciated.

I work hard to achieve my goals and put a lot of time into making sure I achieve what I want to. But an important note is that I only do this with things I deem important. I often try and look at the big picture to put everything into perspective.

This leads me to how I am very reflective about my life and how I want to become the best person possible. I often think about the reasons for life, and enjoy talking about things that are pretty philosophical, I guess. I love to challenge what people commonly believe and to make them (and myself) think in different ways. When I hear a new idea that I haven‚Äôt thought of, I talk to to people about it. But I oftentimes I do this by pretending to agree with this new idea, and seeing what reasoning the other person comes up with that will help support what I originally thought. I guess I sometimes challenge my own thoughts using other people.

I also have I desire to try new things all the time. Anything once, pretty much. I get bored easily, and I want to get different viewpoints about everything. I‚Äôm not really unpredictable, I think, but my desire to explore and experience is almost dangerous.

As far as academics go, I am better at the sciences and math, and I enjoy them more than the humanities. Learning how things make sense is cool. Yet, I am artistic, and think that art (if it has interesting meaning or talent behind it, and I decide that) is important. I play multiple instruments and take photographs. I admire people who are able to get so much meaning out of literature, and don‚Äôt understand people who can‚Äôt seem to follow simple procedures in the sciences.

This shit irritates me so much because that person has no awareness on her surroundings she treats it like in a mall and saying some unnecessary vulgar words loudly. By the time I went out the elevator she called me ""baliw"" which means ""crazy"" for no absolutely reason.

Due to my frustration I ended up reporting that prick to the school staff who in charge the school facilities including the elevator and I labeled that person ""abnormal"" which it fits her quite nicely when you think about it.

- he's so commited to studying he neve shows up during or even close to exams.

- he is consistent in beliefs and style ever since I knew him (14 years ago)

I recently conducted some research on loneliness via a survey, and the responses I got from people blew me away. 

I knew that it was a problem, but I didn‚Äôt realize how MUCH of a problem it was until the survey blew up, got over a thousand responses overnight, and people kept messaging me asking about the results. 

As promised, I‚Äôd like to share the results of the survey for everyone to benefit from. 

Note: on this post I will be sharing the ‚ÄúPersonality Type‚Äù insights from the survey. For the non-personality type insights, read my post in another sub [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeNewFriendsHere/comments/eesy16/results_from_the_survey_about_loneliness_for_a/). 

The goal with the survey was to use the data to determine how big of a problem loneliness really is, and then eventually create a program that aims to ‚Äúcure‚Äù loneliness. 

By ‚Äúcure,‚Äù I mean take someone that struggles with loneliness at 7/10 or higher and bring that down to 3/10 or lower by improving their situation or mental state. 

The survey was quite barebones, but that was intentional. It ended up giving a ton more data than I could‚Äôve predicted. 

Here are the fascinating ‚ÄúPersonality Type vs. Loneliness‚Äù insights uncovered, thanks to all of your help: 

‚ÄúDoes Personality Type affect susceptibility to high feelings of loneliness?‚Äù Yes, it does. 

Why that is, I‚Äôm not exactly sure‚Ä¶ So let me share with you the data, and together we can talk about it. 

The LEAST LONELY personality type on average is the ESTJ, with average feelings of loneliness reported at 4.86/10. 

The MOST LONELY personality type on average is the INFP, with average feelings of loneliness reported at 6.9/10. 

Note that the ESTJ &amp; INFP do not share any similar letters- and each letter compared with each other had consistently different levels of loneliness. 

E‚Äôs average feelings of loneliness is 5.54, whereas I‚Äôs have 6.26. 

S‚Äôs average feelings of loneliness is 5.49, whereas N‚Äôs have 6.27. 
T‚Äôs average feelings of loneliness is 5.74, whereas F‚Äôs have 6.12. 

J‚Äôs average feelings of loneliness is 5.87, whereas P‚Äôs have 6.01. 

This trend held true between all other personality types. For example, the INFJ was the second most lonely personality type, at 6.8 average feelings of loneliness. 

The more INFP letters you have, the more likely you are to feel lonely, and vice versa for the ESTJ letters. 

The top three least lonely personality types are ESTJ (4.86), ESFJ (5), and ESTP (5). 

The top three most lonely personality types are INFP (6.9), INFJ (6.8), and ENFJ (6.54). 

That is all for personality type- for all other insights about this project, review the full report [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeNewFriendsHere/comments/eesy16/results_from_the_survey_about_loneliness_for_a/).

 I've always been very organized, attentive and focused but in the past two months I have been noticing some changes in my routine, such as not being as punctual and motivated in relation to deadlines and classes in college as I used to be and a lot of anxiety and insecurity.
 
I suspect it has something to do with the stress I've been facing at home and a series of deceptions with my dating life, wich made me feel like I'm too wrong to be in a relationship, since I am commonly described as ""weird"", ""autistic"" or ""different from everyone else"" by pretty much every person who gets to know me on another level.
 
In addition to that, I'm procrastinating way more frequently, cannot focus when reading or studying and feel really desperate about my future and what the hell I'm going to do when I graduate (2 more years to go). All in all, I feel like my life is a mess and that I'm quite unstable. I have already signed up for therapy at another college in my city but I'll only be called next year.

ISTJ,"I was doing some hunting on the behavior of ISTJs when they‚Äôre interested in a relationship with someone and came across a website the gave some insight. Do you think this is pretty standard? My ISTJ and I have been going for a few months but recently feeling that ISTJ is being a little less consistent with dates/communication. I have been assuming this AJ because I said that I don‚Äôt mind out communication and visits being less consistent during the past month as we‚Äôve both been incredibly busy and tired. But I have past relationships baggage that makes me feel self conscious of lack of interest. I know ISTJs (especially this one) take things that people say to heart, but I‚Äôm starting to wish I hadn‚Äôt said anything...

‚ÄúDuring the time of our deliberation, we may or may not exhibit the following behaviors:

Avoiding you. This could range from full-on panic and running in the opposite direction to seeming overly busy or preoccupied when you try to talk to us.
Prolonged eye contact to suss out the vibes (and because we probably read somewhere that we‚Äôre supposed to).
Saying hi to a mutual acquaintance you‚Äôre talking to while just barely acknowledging your presence.
Cornering you for slightly scripted conversation.
Making light jokes at your expense.
Complimenting you to other people (in your absence) to see if they offer any additional information.
Generally speaking, I will dismiss any signs of interest (which I have researched on the internet) as you just being friendly and polite. I tend to be attracted to people who are friendlier than me, so this is often a logical conclusion.


We hide our interest until we have a solid plan.

Once an ISTJ decides to be in love with you, we will begin to endure the introverted agony of longing for a relationship without the awkwardness of transitions. This usually results in one of two possible outcomes:

If you catch us in a feisty mood, we will straight up tell you how we feel‚Ä¶ if only to alleviate the chaos of secret infatuation.
Our procrastination kicks in and we suffer the paralysis of analysis while hoping that you pick up on our extremely subtle cues. Cues include intentional eye contact and/or initiating small talk.
When it comes to romantic interests, I am typically in love or indifferent. Aside from you discovering my interest before I develop a game plan, the biggest threat of mortification is someone else noticing my prolonged eye contact or the fact that I found seventeen reasons to walk past you in a span of ten minutes. I become hyper-aware of who else is around and often end up sabotaging myself‚Äù",1576635966

ISTJ,"Hello! I‚Äôm a 24 y/o ENFJ type with an ISTJ bf, we‚Äôve been together officially for 7 months but have been more than friends for almost a year. The first 5 months it was long distance (we met in person by chance when I was scoping out a town for school and it just built from there) but since I‚Äôve moved out here it‚Äôs been a journey of growth and healing for me and I feel with time he opens up more. Everything is wonderful, however my own personal insecurities (personal experience and my personality type) makes the emotional stuff a little confusing at times. 

Sometimes I‚Äôm afraid to be too much, like too emotionally expressive. We had a conversation recently about how sometimes I feel like I shouldn‚Äôt express how much I care about/love him because when I do he doesn‚Äôt really say anything and I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôm making him uncomfortable. He said it‚Äôs just that I‚Äôm so powerful at expressing my feelings he‚Äôs afraid his answers will fall short or just doesn‚Äôt know what to say. For the first time he said ‚Äúyou know you‚Äôre like everything to me though, right?‚Äù And I felt really bad for saying no not really, that in his actions I know he does but sometimes I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm just reading it as him caring when maybe he doesn‚Äôt? 

As stupid as it is I accidentally told him I loved him the first month of us officially dating, and he still hasn‚Äôt said that directly to me. I just want to make sure I‚Äôm showing him I care in ways he feels affection and love, and that I‚Äôm not projecting how I would like to be loved onto him. He told me he‚Äôs uncomfortable with receiving compliments so he forgets to give people compliments, and I apologized for being overly complimentary since I usually feel like I‚Äôm missing affirmation so I try to give that to others. 

We‚Äôre going to meet his family for Christmas (out of state from here, and I‚Äôve never met them) and I just want to make sure we have a lovely time and that I don‚Äôt take anything too personally or sensitively (since he loves to tease me as is let alone around his friends or family). We‚Äôre going to start looking into finding somewhere to live together when we get back (his idea surprisingly) and while I‚Äôm probably overthinking all of this, since he‚Äôs said unless he says something is wrong it‚Äôs all good, I just want to make sure he‚Äôs as happy as I am.

ISTJ,"Hi! I'm a enfj female, 7w6 on the enneagram and I believe that the guy I'm going to talk about is a 6 and probably an istj.

I'm usually outgoing and I like to know new people but when I am romantically interested in someone I am shy, and because of that I prefer the man to take the lead.

Anyway, I don't know this guy very much. This is the biggest problem...  We've done a group project together for a class and that's all. Obviously we have talked and I think he thinks I'm nice since I was the one he laughed with the most.
He has his group of friends but I don't know any of those. How can I get to know him better? 
How can I hint at him that I'd like to talk to him more?
I've read that you guys like deep connections (I also do!)... Any tips to get there? 

Some more general questions... 
How do you see enfj females (enneagram 7)? How do you behave when you like someone? 
How do you build a genuine deep connection with a new person that you click with?

ISTJ,"I've noticed that a lot of social problems I've had over the years have been to do with the way I am. I always err on the side of silence and politeness which doesn't make me as interesting at first. It takes persistence and time for me to be comfortable enough to share the good parts of myself that people tend to like.

I've been reading a lot into self improvement over the past few months and have implemented a lot of it. I don't normally have a problem making conversation (although I still sometimes choose not to BC I lack the energy) but when talking to people I'm intimidated by whether it be they're attractive or I want them to like me I still feel like an imposter and subconsciously think they dislike me.

I saw a post recently with that old quote along the lines of ""too many ppl listen to reply instead of understand"". This is exactly how I feel. I can make conversation, but I'm too worried about making it flow and seem normal that I'm not actually wondering if I'm enjoying having these conversations. It's like I'm so worried about people pleasing, that I'm not actually thinking in I actually like them. Sometimes I forget it's a two way street.

It makes me doubt the progress I've made and whether I'm just naturally wired to want to hide away from all social interaction.

I dated an ISTJ female for 4 years and am trying to get her back. I dont want to text her and annoy her seeming desperate but also I dont want to give her too much space because I feel like im losing her. How do I get her back the right way?",1576218886
ISTJ,"Hey,

First, I want to apologize for coming here and asking for relationship advice from you guys. I know you may think it is annoying for people to come to your thread to discuss relationships. However, this is the first time I have ever posted on any type of forum, so I hope you can understand I have put a lot of thought into this issue and am not coming her unnecessarily. I would like other input without going to anyone IRL. I know a lot of my issue may just be self explanatory but I pace around in my room thinking how I do not know what to do everyday, so this has led to me finally coming to others for input.

I dated a Female ISTJ all throughout college. She is the love of my life. She is extremely loyal and gave me stability of which is desperately needed. The thing is that we are vastly different from each other, specifically in the ways that we spent our times partying in college. This led to many disputes and us thinking that we may not be right for each other. We broke up three times but that was not because we wanted to.  We had issues with communicating with each other in that we never discussed relationship problems. We just treated each other like best friends and thats why I think it was so great at times. But, when it came down to the relationship it was just confusing, and writing this is even hard because im still confused...lol. 

The basics of her problem with me was that she did not appreciate me getting so drunk, smoking cigarettes and not going to church with her. I felt that it was college so I was going to do those things while I can, and make the most of my time being young. I never wanted her to be out of my life. Although I did have issues with her as well.

After we graduated college we broke up officially a month after. She told me she thinks I have things I need to figure out. At first I agreed with her. I did not want to be with her because I felt resentment for her because she felt resentment from me. It has been about 5 months since this time and we both still keep in contact with each other. She told me she would not give up on me but she is not going to wait for me either. 

I know it may seem like we are not right for each other and that we may be too different. However, I appreciated those differences because we complemented each other well. We were very compatible and we were with each other every day. We were both loyal and never raised our voices with each other. I really feel as though I need her because of the stability and her personality is the one I want in someone I spend the rest of my life with. 

I want to be with her. I feel like my life is finally starting and im finally ready to start acting like an adult.  The absolute biggest reason she wont be with me is because she does not want to look like an ""idiot"" by her family for taking me back and giving me another chance. That as well as that I did not really have a direction in my life until recently which she does not know about yet.

Here is my issue, I do not know what to do to win her back. I cant tell her any of these things to her face because Ill seem desperate and I know that is a big turn off for her. I dont know whether I should text her every so often because I dont want to annoy her.  But  everyday that goes that we do not talk, I feel like I am losing her more and more. I do not know what to do and I feel like the obvious answer is to live my life and be happy myself and If it comes it comes but at the same time I have these moments where I say fuck that I need to go and get her back and I need to do it now. She is such a confusing individual and has her standards for everything it is so hard to figure out what the fuck to do.",1576207124

ISTJ,"Hello y'all! This is my first post on reddit. Maybe you ask yourself why am I doing this post. Well, the thing is that, I think I have been mistyped by a free test on the internet that you all have probably already taken it as well. At this point I may sound stupid if I simply believed what that test said. No, I didn't. 

First of all, I was firstly classified as a Turbulent INTJ. When I have first read the description, the strengths and weaknesses of the personality I was very intrigued by it and I also felt so good to be one of the most rare types in the world. Very childish I could say, and you can say that too.

So, it's been 1 year since I have got into MBTI and I'm pretty familiar with functions, their places, how they work because I did a lot of research when I got my first result. It seemed too good to be true. Like, I didn't think I'm worthy of that and I had questions about it continuously. I know being an INTJ is not that much of a big deal, right? But for me, at that point was.

And that certainty started to fade. All of a sudden I wasn't that sure that I am an INTJ after all. Si dominant looked very relatable and stuff and I started to think that I may have looked like an INTJ just because of the auxiliary Te and tertiary Fi, and nowadays I really think I am an ISTJ. Even though I don't like to admit that. 

It's very foolish, because everyone could be a great person no matter what type he or she is. And so guys, I would really like to hear your opinion. If you have some information, some scenarios or questions that could help me out with finding what type I really am, that could be very helpful. I'm opened to it.",1576156925
ISTJ,"I'm going through a bit of an extended shower thought period and I was just wondering if you guys relate or if it's just me.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Background\*\*

I've always found it hard to fit in. I think my tendency to play everything perfect, involving pretending to be something I'm not had something to do with it. This along with the fact I err on the side of silence. Also, I tend to get embarassed when I don't see myself as being perfect when in reality no one cares e.g with how I look in photos (I was annoyed for a couple of days bc I wasn't looking at the camera in the last group photo of high school). I avoid doing so many things bc of this so I think ppl may think I'm bland.

I'm super unsentimental. As a kid, I used to be the opposite and now I don't really celebrate anything. I like xmas but I'm just not feeling it, especially this year. I don't ask for gifts for bdays or xmas since I don't like ppl wasting their money on things that they don't know if I want. I live a very efficient life and I normally have enough money to buy what I need when I need it so gifts for me are a little pointless. Very much not an impulse buyer and will spend weeks of research to find the best deals on the stuff I do want.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Where I'm at currently\*\*

Sometimes I feel like there's something wrong with me. If I didn't see people being happy in groups and having bffs that they're inseperable from etc. then I think I would be perfectly happy on my own. I've only changed my perceptions and actions due to fomo. I'm currently feeling weird as I feel like I never really had friendships that lived up to my expectations.

I find it hard to vibe with people or be close without relating. I hung out with one of my close friends recently. Our whole friendship has been really polite smalltalk and sharing interests. I'll be honest, the whole time I never really saw her as close, merely someone to make smalltalk with until I talked to them about a personal issue. After that, I think we both acknowledged we were close and since then I just describe them as close even tho I don't feel the dynamic has changed at all. So I consider them close, but I don't feel close when I actually talk to them if that makes sense?

Normally I only feel comfortable when someone, usually an extrovert, extends me an olive branch and makes sure to include me otherwise I feel like a complete outsider and no matter how little evidence there is, I'll always feel like the ppl in the group secretly don't like me unless they've personally extended me that branch too. The majority of my friends have been made via these extroverts.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a really bad listener. I've noticed that I normally try to convey something that's on my mind and I try to sneak that in (sometimes by accidentally not paying attention to what the other person is saying).

I sometimes can't be arsed to talk to people. Even with my best friend, a lot of the time I don't want to talk to him. I'm the type of person who has the ability to reply instantly if I want to, but I choose not to mostly. I do this bc I cba to chat about mostly smalltalky stuff and I just want my alone time. I do reply to him bc I don't ignore ppl, but I definitely keep him waiting a little. It took so long for us to become best friends, so long that we stopped going to the same school. I feel like I just want close friends immediately despite knowing that I'm slow to warm to ppl. I'm so quick to discard ppl based on quick judgements, and I'm sooo judgy. I think I may be missing out on some cool ppl bc of this.

When people come vent to me, I have no idea what to do. I feel like in my head I play out scenarios like these and they seem so easy, but in reality I panic bc I feel like I have to give perfect responses so I go through a mental numbered checklist. However, I feel like the majority of my responses are trying to solve their problem for them, which I know is bad especially since I hate that too.

Ironically, all I want is someone who gets me. I'd say in all my life, I've only had one extremely good friend (INFJ) in that regard. It's complicated and looking back, since I had feelings for her, I'm not sure if we were really that close or just I was overreacting to positive signs. Regardless, I felt like I could be myself for a time and shared super dark personal secrets. That's why it killed me when things went south recently. I'm not sure if I liked her or if it was just bc she was pretty and a good listener. Maybe I'm just downplaying everything in hindsight. In fact I may be over reacting to what happened. We used to talk 24/7 for about half a year but we don't talk now as I was getting vibes like they didn't want to carry on talking so eventually I stopped making any effort. There was never any explicit fallout, but I feel like there should be equal effort. Haven't heard from her in a while now.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no energy for social interaction half the time. When I'm home I just want to be left alone. My mum doesn't seem to get it and always tries to pester me to talk to her about it since her and my sister talk about everything. She doesn't understand my need for alone time and even bigger, she doesn't get that I will only share things when I'm ready. Her constant pushing and casual dismissals of my problems/ snide remarks are why I don't share a single detail with her at all. I also really hate being bothered whilst eating. I don't get how seemingly how so much of (sober) social life revolves around eating together. I like to eat really fast and on my own and not worry about if I have something in my teeth or if I'm displaying bad table manners inadvertantly. The worst one is if someone is trying to talk to me when I have a mouthful. I honestly hate eating around people.",1576114629

he's not physically abusive, but man oh man is he so emotionally abusive... he almost always thinks he's right, he doesn't like talking about feelings, is often insensitive and impatient when I share feelings, is very aggressive in times of distress for me..

day-to-day he is calm, but even then in those times he is very distant in general... has never been close to me or intimate emotionally..

today we had an argument, and I politely asked if I could ask him a question... I prefaced it with something like, ""I've wanted to ask this for the past few weeks but don't want to put you on the spot""...

he gave me the okay to ask, so I said: ""why are you uncomfortable with talking about feelings""

and he came back on the defense some overly logical question like ""well that presupposes that theres things I won't talk about.. we can talk about anything""

and I was trying to articulate that he doesn't seem comfortable talking about feelings... and he came back with something about how I'm the reason he doesn't talk about feelings.. I don't recall what it was, but it was him trying to project onto me, that I am the reason he doesn't share feelings when we talk..

I then said ""well you've always been this way, so it's my fault at 4 years old""... and then he began to walk away.

He isn't a horrible dad, in terms of financial support he's very good... but emotionally, and being a true father figure he is just totally absent, and then tries to blame things on me...

(5) even when they are in the ""getting stuff done and telling people what to do"" mode, it doesn't bug me because the tone of voice is rarely harsh/disagreeable ... *I might not obey everything that every ISTJ orders, but the fact that they are giving me orders doesn't bother me -- I probably needed some auxiliary decisiveness and direction anyway (and I can always ignore orders that I don't like, right?)*

ISTJ,"Hi everyone,

I have a quick and simple question from a feeler type.

I admire your qualities, and understand that at times your simply have completely different motives than us. You like rules, order and control. These qualities you seem to like over harmony; specifically in the workplace. For you, its not about maintaining harmony, but more about getting the work done, and doing it in the most direct path. This tends to be chaotic but simultaneously the most pragmatic and logical way of doing things. 

Now, what I can't understand is why you go out of your way to provoke people (sometimes only mildly). In the case of mildly provoking, maybe provoking isn't be the greatest choice of words (perhaps keeping people in-check then). For example, my ISTJ boss has another ISTJ boss above her, and so they both like micromanaging each other, and their tends to be adequate communication between the two. 

Now, these two people get along quiet well, but, the higher boss decided to do a surprise visit to our workplace. Everything went fine, and all is well (because of the excellent leadership of my boss -the lower one). But she felt the need to provoke her boss, because ""technically"" he should have made us fill out paperwork and made the staff sign it before he left; even though the inspection was kinda informal. She felt the need to ring him just to stir him, and remind him of the rules (though this was more like a technicality).   

Now I know a first response is gonna be ""I was just keeping them in-check so they do their job better etc"". But, I can't help but feel the need to provoke (or keep people in check) has some underlying ""control"" element to it. 

Why?    Why?   provoke people when it's really not that important. I don't know if I speak for all feelers, but a feeler would want to maintain harmony and just be like ""well, whatever it went fine anyway"".

I'm not saying I don't approve, I just don't get it. Is it to get one up on them?, control?, or even just for the love of the rules? and I'm more referring to if there's any underlying motives that your not always aware of.

Honesty is appreciated. Thanks in advance!",1574666361

ISTJ,"Well, not ""weaknesses"" but ""common areas for improvement"", I guess. 

I just got back from a professional development course about the MBTI and I once again tested as an ISTJ. We got a booklet that lists some ""suggestions for development"" for each type. For ISTJs, those are:

*May need to pay attention to wider, future ramifications of problems in addition to current realities.

*May need to consider the human element and communicate deserved appreciation.

*May need to try fresh alternatives to avoid ruts. 

*May need to develop patience for those who communicate differently or who bypass standard operating procedures. 

I find myself already ""communicating deserved praise"" although I admit this is a learned trait. And I do indeed need to develop more patience with people who communicate differently; I find that people who talk through their problems (rather than think through them like I do) used to annoy me until I learned about different communication and problem-solving styles.

ISTJ,"Okay this is kind of a long story so I apologize in advance. I met my soulmate Septemer 20th, an ISTJ 29 yr old man. He was visiting my city for a week for business. He introduced himself to me after I finished my work at my job. He'd been drinking by himself in the corner of a cafe. And instantly when I met him, I knew I was going to marry him. I had never felt this feeling in my life, but I knew one day when I met the man I was going to marry I would know instantly. I was so giddy and nervous I acted cool and sort of brushed him off and was going to leave work with friends but instead I got a drink and sat down with him with my friends. He had to leave the next day at 7am. We end up going out with my friends but he and I ventured by ourselves and spent the entire night, kissing and talking, no sex. And I even drove him to the airport. Then the next day we made plans for me to visit the end of October. He was texting me and calling and face timing for a solid week and a half. We talked about what a strange coincidence of us meeting and this very very ""mutual feeling"" neither of us have ever felt before but were experiencing with one another. I ask if I could visit him earlier, just for a day, because I was busy with work, I had miles to use, and I wanted him bad.

Fast forward I go fly 2k miles to see him where he lives and we spend 24 hours together (met his brother, his friends, and his psuedo mom and dad). I was very happy, and he was waiting for me outside of security and I was smiling like a damned fool when I saw him. Everything was perfect, until the 3 weeks between that first trip and the second trip. He stopped calling me, seemed very busy, he had a bachelor party to  go to, he had a trip to mexico he went on. I bring it up to him why he's been distant and he opens up and basically tells me he sees everything very future oriented and he doesnt want to force me to leave the city I love and live in and dreams im working towards. Because his foundation is his hometown and he can't move. But I assure him i never had a foundation in life and I liked his city and if it came to it in the future, I would move to him. Im also mentioning I took plan b and went on birth control for him, even though both made me extremely sick. and he kNOWS this and I would tell him ""he was worth it.""

So I end up going on this trip this last weekend. I felt something was off the moment I saw him, which made me kind of silent and closed off. I can't force myself to be lovey dovey with someone who is making plans right in front of me with other people for trips that are on/around my birthday. (mind you when we first met he asked me when my birthday was, assuming he wanted to do something together? idk?) Anyways I made even better friends with his friends and family. His psuedo mom and dad invited me to their thanksgiving and gave me their phone number. The psuedo mom said she never cared for anyone he's brought around before but she really liked me.

This whole trip we were never really alone. First night and second day morning we had sex. The first night we had sex, he didnt even cuddle with me after, he was on his phone, which isn't at all what he did the first trip when I saw him, it hurt my feelings. saturday night his friends were over till 4 am and I went to bed by 1 am since time change. Then sunday morning I tried initiating sex and he kinda got up and went and took a shower. I jokingly said, ""im not leaving the bed till you fuck me"" and he was like, well I have a meeting to go to so either you can come with or stay here. So I got dressed and went with him. 

Finally that last day (Sunday) we get home and he says lets shower so I wait for him expecting were gunna take a shower together but he never comes up stairs, so i go downstairs and hes watching tv and I ask why he isnt showering and he says ""i meant I shower, then you shower."" and I said ""cant we shower together?"" and he says ""no I want to shower alone"" and I said ""the first trip I saw you, you always wanted to shower together, why not now?"" and he responds with ""I wanted to have sex that's why""

Anyways we were cuddling on the couch and starting making out and I smile and look at him after I kiss him and he physically pushes me off of him and shivers like he saw a ghost and was repulsed. I asked whats wrong and he says ""I just don't like having people close to my face, it gives me anxiety"". Which is weird since the first night we met all he did was stare into my eyes until i broke eye contact because I was so nervous. He goes up to shower, I lay down on the other couch and just try to sleep away the pain of someone being repulsed by my affection. He comes down and tries telling me I can take a shower now, so i go up stairs take a shower and just lay in his bed.  He finally comes up after maybe an hour.  I straight up ask him after 15 minutes of him laying next to me ""Am I bad at sex?"" he says ""no.""  Then I ask him again why he reacted the way he did when i kissed him, again he talks about it giving him anxiety. Then he starts going on a silent vague talk about how I'm a saint, he's a bad influence on people, he thought being surrounded by good people would make him a good person. Something that happened 1.5 years ago he used to think he was in the right but he's realizing maybe he was the bad person (mind you he broke up with his ex who wanted kids ASAP and he didnt).

Basically he ends up telling me he doesn't feel a connection with me anymore and he wanted to see through this trip if the connection was strong enough to do long distance because he needs something tangible. So I turn the lights on and I pack my bag and walk out his front door. He says I'm being illogical. I say this isn't a logical situation. He says at least let me drive you and pay for the hotel. And I said I dont need your pity. I am a grown woman. He said ""this town can be dangerous I dont want to be responsible for someone's daughter getting hurt""  and i turn to him and said ""Im not someone's dog youre repsonsible for for the fucking weekend."" i said ""Go inside, whats it to you what happens to me. Seems like a personal problem if I end up in a ditch in the morning or not. You just told me you have no feelings for me so what's it to you what happens to me.""  The entire time we are outside on the sidewalk he has his arms crossed and was looking at me with absolutely no emotion whatsoever, it made me really sad.

I sat on the side walk and cried and waited for my uber. he went back inside. I got myself a hotel. And my flight left the next day. I had posted a quote on my instagram story, which he saw. He never texted me or called me if I got anywhere safe or home okay. Nothing. radio silence

So a day later I texted him a piece of my mind. He said maybe things would be different if I lived in his city but he was really blown away by my ""snap hook"" as he put it, reaction to him rejecting me and leaving that night. I see nothing wrong in extracting myself out of that situation, no way in hell I could be in the same vicinity as him after all that. The conversation continues and he basically said ""I wasn‚Äôt repulsed at all. I have very high anxiety and depression and a huge problem with closeness in my face and it freaked me out."" and then he had to go into a meeting and that he'd talk later. I don't hear from him for a day so I ask him when are we going to finish the conversation and he says ""Do you want an explanation? I summed up my feelings about everything last night I‚Äôm sorry if I hurt you but this is bad bad energy and I want this to be done with. I don‚Äôt think we are compatible and that‚Äôs ok. I want the best for you and never wanted to cause you a problem. I‚Äôm sorry"" 

so I said this ""last night you said wed talk later bc you were busy. bad energy? i think ignoring someone is bad energy. the only bad thing is how you treated me and didn‚Äôt care. All that bad energy is from you. Funny you talk about wanting to be a better person, well this was your chance and you‚Äôre still treating me like Im some 2 dollar prostitute. I have a right to my emotional reaction for an emotional situation.  I‚Äôm allowed to be hurt by your rude behavior. I may be nice but I‚Äôm not dumb. Treat me like crap once I‚Äôm not rolling over for more. And you wouldn‚Äôt know if we were compatible or not because we‚Äôve spent less than 20 conscious hours actually one on one alone together.  you dont know me at all. good luck to the next ‚Äúfriend‚Äù of the many ‚Äúfriends‚Äù you bring around your friends and family. I hope the dumb bitch doesn‚Äôt fall for the same ‚Äúim a cowboy gentleman, I never felt such a strong connection, dumb kissey‚Äù bs i did. actions have consequences, \[insert ISTJ name here\]. Especially ones of the heart. You cant just expect to break something emotionally and to bury it like it‚Äôs dead. Thats not how emotions work. You should really learn to be more respectful and mindful of a woman‚Äôs body, mind, emotion, femme, and soul after you violate it‚Äôs peace and integrity. Instead of being selfish and only thinking of yourself. Learn some goddamn empathy if you ever plan on ‚Äúhelping‚Äù people in the future. it makes me sad that people like you exist in this world. all talk. no heart. goodbye""  Mind you I mentioned the helping people part because i asked where he saw himself in 10 years and he said helping people get on their feet in life. He also posted about some mini fundraiser he did recently raising money for families for thanksgiving. but money doesn't help people. At least not to the extent empathy, respect and being a decent human being does.

I then blocked him because I don't need to hear anymore sociopathic responses. I know he is not a sociopath, I've dated one of those before. I said these venomous things because he treated me like nothing after I flew out twice to see him with my own money and on my time. He never cared to know me. I never got to know him. He didn't give me a chance. I was closed off to love for almost 3 years before I met him. He made me believe again. And now I'm in disbelief, again.

I just cant help but hold these strong feelings for him. I truly believe he is my soulmate, even now. I just think either he needs to work on becoming a better person and working through his internal issues and then maybe in the future something could happen. or maybe he's my soulmate and I'm not his because this is a cruel world we live in. I'm so heartbroken, I cried more and mourned more about this than my three year relationship with my ex. I only knew this man for a month. What do I do? Does he really feel nothing? Within 8 hours? How does someone completely change and shut it off like that? Are his feelings really gone? or are they just be suppressed? Will he come crawling back after he realizes what he's lost? I'm sad, the first day I met him, I felt like that was the real him he showed me. I felt safe, comfortable, and warm. But it's like Jekyll and Hyde. What's going on?! I feel like I was hit by an ISTJ tornado.

TL;DR I met my soulmate ISTJ, started off long distance but mutual very strong connection, saw him twice. Last day of trip he decides to tell me he doesn't feel strong enough connection for long distance with me after he started talking about having anxiety and depression etc. Is he suppressing feelings for me because of his internal issues?",1573149012

ISTJ,"Hello,

I think I have come to the most likely conclusion that I am an ISTJ, also I‚Äôd like to discuss the topic of intuition bias and why I thought I was ENTJ/INTJ.

ISTJ functions.

‚Ä¢ Lead : Dom : Si

I have a habit in work for saying ‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt go their‚Äù ‚ÄúDo yee not have one of X for that?‚Äù ‚ÄúI remember in the last job we did X and had Y‚Äù ‚ÄúDid you ever use those attachments for X?‚Äù

And being a walking encyclopaedia for different procedures and ways of doing things, 
Things like that‚Äôs are relative to my past experiences. 

And I also have an ability to get better and better the more I practice this may seem like common sense or silly but you would astounded working in hospitality the last 3 years how many people just can‚Äôt get something or need help and constant supervision every shift.

I really need to get stuck in and do something once I‚Äôve been trained I will remember it for a very long time. I work in hospitality and you have to be very organised and it helps me a lot because I can notice things that are out of place or that should be done to a certain standard every time.

‚Ä¢ Auxilary : Te

I think in the external world, Everything is relative to what is going on infront of me and not based on an internal framework like in the case of Ti, this can cause me to be seen as ‚Äúopinionated‚Äù sometimes because Te strong types the STJs and NTJs need things done a certain way STJs for efficiency, NTJs to meet their long term vision. My Te comes out more in work and takes a back seat at home, In contrast too ESTJs and ENTJs that are in constant Te mode because it‚Äôs their dominant function so they need to be constantly organising, on the move and gaming something.

‚Ä¢Fi : Teritary 

I have a strong sense of what‚Äôs right and wrong, I also place an importance on my inner values and how others perceive me and my guidance system in life like who I am and what I want to be, this is where we get our duty core from.

‚Ä¢ Ne: Inferior 

The weakest function, I can sometimes get stumped ‚Äúbridging the gap‚Äù this is why I struggled with abstract maths in school because I wasn‚Äôt able too skip all the steps like my probably ‚ÄúNT‚Äù teacher was and the other students good at more advanced maths, I always needed to do it step by step and ask a lot of questions. I‚Äôm skeptical for the future and I plan against it. 

I need to be told something as it is, and I will tell others how it is dont speak with metaphors or hidden meanings, I‚Äôm not great at intuition and I‚Äôm also bad at reading others intentions, sometimes I can be too skeptical. 

When I‚Äôm really stressed the Ne turns bad and the ‚ÄúNe‚Äù ‚Äúgrip‚Äù makes me paranoid about the future and too many possibilities. 

‚Ä¢ The Intuitive Bias ‚Ä¢

Their is a thing called the Intuitive bias where Sensors who are more in touch and control with their intuition mistype as Intuitives, this also can happen in a lot of introverted sensors as they are less outgoing and may turn to somewhat ‚Äúintuitive‚Äù hobbies like movies, video games, fictional reading causing them to be more open too ‚Äúout their‚Äù media and opinions. 

You have to look past the stereotypes, Intuitives can be concrete and we can have gut feelings but it‚Äôs your primary mode of operation you need to worry about what are you like under stress, in work, by yourself with others. 

I would hazard a guess as too why the Sensing subs are so quiet is because being a Intuitive is somewhat romanticised and nobody wants to be seen as  conservative or lacking vision but I would put money on it that half of INTJ, ENTJ, INTP and ENTP are actually S‚Äôs mistyped.

‚Ä¢ J/P bias ‚Ä¢

I also think their might be a judging bias whereas P types that don‚Äôt want to be seen as ‚ÄúLazy‚Äù or ‚Äúunorganised‚Äù want to pick J based answers. J/P isn‚Äôt more concerned with your external all the time as in that person is so clean and organised they must be a judger, not so much it‚Äôs about cognition and not action a lot of the time.

J comes more from anxiety and P comes from confidence, to explain J is we need to have a plan, I‚Äôm not going without knowing all the details, ‚Äúwe need to talk about this first‚Äù , ‚Äúwe need a contingency in case anything goes wrong‚Äù, J is more pessimistic and realistic in cognition.  - ‚ÄúI hate when theirs no clear plan and too much unplanned change‚Äù

P is confidence that you will be able to take on what ever comes your way, ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt need a plan‚Äù, live in the moment , ‚Äúcross that bridge when we come to it‚Äù this leads P to be seen as carefree and unorganised. 
- ‚ÄúI welcome change and planning is for suckers‚Äù",1572646484

ISTJ,"**Here‚Äôs what I mean by that:** You appreciate and respect ‚Äúhard and fast‚Äù rules, and believe that they exist for good reason. You do not seem to like when ‚Äúsoft‚Äù constraints are placed on you.

**Here‚Äôs my rationale:** 33(M) INFJ who has been dating 33(F) ISTJ for ten years, and we got married last month (!). She hates breaking the rules, as in, she would sit at an empty traffic light at midnight for 20 minutes before thinking about just going through. 

Since we‚Äôve gotten engaged and married, I‚Äôve attempted to discuss some constraints that might lead to health and happiness in the future: Things like saving more money, drinking a bit less, not going out to eat as much, etc. The conversations go well when we have them. There is a bit of back and forth negotiation, but they‚Äôre civil and we come to reasonable compromise.

Weeks or months down the line, however, she seems to return to previous habits, claiming that ‚Äúshe forgot‚Äù or arguing her way out of it some other way (often finding rules-lawery loopholes in what was said). I don‚Äôt think she forgot, as she‚Äôs very intelligent and has a very good memory for this type of thing. I just think she doesn‚Äôt like self-imposed constraints, or at least doesn‚Äôt take them seriously. They‚Äôre not ‚Äúreal‚Äù rules, after all.

**Why I'm raising this now:** She‚Äôs a traveling consultant and she‚Äôs always been a bit of a tom boy. What this amounts to is that she is often hanging out with a guy or two at late dinners and drinks. Some of the relationships I find a bit disconcerting, as in, I can tell some of the guys are interested in being more than friends (based on meeting them a couple of times‚Ä¶ and as an INFJ I‚Äôm good at reading the situation). 

I‚Äôd like to discuss some reasonable boundaries with her, such as ‚Äúby all means be friends and get friendly dinners, but no late night one-on-one drinking, limit the flirty texting, etc.‚Äù. Knowing her though, she say ‚Äúfine, fine, fine‚Äù but then return to normal behavior a couple of weeks later.

To be clear, I trust that she won‚Äôt be physically unfaithful, but I don‚Äôt always think she understands emotional infidelity - or thinks about it the same way that I do. I feel that these late night 1:1 sessions are a bit disrespectful as they will slowly erode what makes our relationship special. I think that she thinks, ‚Äúchill out, OP, they‚Äôre just friends‚Äù.

If you‚Äôve made it this far, I‚Äôd really appreciate your insight on this: How can reasonable constraints and boundaries be imposed and respected without me looking like a wet blanket or controlling?",1571927466
ISTJ,"I‚Äôm the INFP( 20yrs male) my friends the ISTJ (soon 21yrs male). I‚Äôve been friends with him since high school, we‚Äôve hung out a lot of times after we graduated until he got a job where he works almost the whole day so we just play online games together when he doesn‚Äôt work, since he‚Äôs told me he‚Äôs tired on his days off with occasional eating out or hanging out. Before my current situation we did have a few bumps where I would kinda get emotional and ask him straight out something and he would answer honestly and it always sorted out very quickly within 30 mins with one time him saying I seem to have a miserable life and he wanted to help me unwind by saying we should go visit other places which we never did but I thought it was nice of him to suggest and felt he opened a bit with me.

Recently I blew up on him over text (this whole thing was over text) cause I saw he was playing a game and changed his status to offline so I wouldn‚Äôt see that he was playing to which I assumed the worst. I was stressed about school and family and ended up saying some pretty self-deprecating things about myself and bring up my past to which 30 mins go by and I apologized to him, telling him I was just scarred and my heart was beating so fast to which he responded ‚Äúchill‚Äù and, after I calmed down I asked him if we could hang out sometime so he could openly hear me out assuming we were still good and he responded yeah. Though he hadn‚Äôt been responding to me so I just kept apologizing to him and telling him I‚Äôll try to keep my emotions in check and being direct more for 2 days until the last message few messages I sent saying I‚Äôll leave him alone which was for three days. 

After the threes days which is today I asked if he would forgive me and I was sorry for blowing up on him and if I could make it up to him he then replied yeah that he felt overwhelmed and I immediately replied saying sorry again that I would work on it and hoped we could play we never did so I waited many hours then messaged him if he still need space cause I was trying to be frank though I appreciated him forgiving me (no reply)

Through the situation I did search up what I should do and tried applying it which majority said to give time, be direct, don‚Äôt be emotionally heavy but much of it was relationship advice between a couple which we are not. I‚Äôd appreciate help since I‚Äôve been trying to see it from his perspective by asking him directly but he just won‚Äôt answer and since I‚Äôm a INFP I‚Äôm trying very hard to not get my emotions involved.

I was hit with how emotionally dense I am last night when I asked my boyfriend (INTP) something subjective.  In way of answer, he basically led me into a discussion that made me uncomfortable and then looped back around to explain to me how and why it answered my question and proved his point.

If anything resonates with you after reading through this, shout it out because I'm quite lost as to what direction I want to take this big change in, but I want to take it soon.

Unlike my previous relationships, this one seems slow paced and I am aware that ISTJs take time to open up. This is what I have noticed so far: 

\- She doesn‚Äôt seem as affectionate as I am, so it‚Äôs difficult for me to make moves, because I don‚Äôt want to make her feel uncomfortable. The most intimate thing that I have done so far is kiss on the cheek. I always hug her at the end of our outing.

\- She is conservative with her money. It is not a deal breaker as she always thanks me, but I sometimes wonder if she is ever going to pick up the bill? 

\- She is very career-focused, so sometimes it takes time for her to text back. I am usually good with texting back on time even when I am busy.

\- She sometimes ignores some of my comments. I am pretty detail-oriented, so I always comment/answer to all of her messages. 

\- I always have to initiate to see her. I would ask if she is free this weekend and she normally gives me a thumbs up or down. I know ISTJs like to stick to their schedules, so I feel thankful that she makes time for us. I usually see her once a week.

Despite all the struggles that I am going through, I cannot stop thinking of her and it's driving me nuts! Earlier this week, she told me she wants to meet my friends because I talk about them a lot. This to me feels like she is interested in me and willing to take things seriously.

ISTJ,"He's a smart dude who works in Microsoft, and he's only 23. Very calm and collected, follows plans until he accomplishes what he sets to do. Has many friends and a good social life. His biggest weakness is relationships, but definitely shows a side where he wants affection and just someone to walk through life with sometimes. 


His biggest weakness? Emotional conflict and dealing with others' emotions. Usually this might not be that big of a deal, but he's had very little dating experience both physically and emotionally, and he's realizing that he needs to grow up if he ever wants to land a girlfriend and be less lonely. He's not good at conflict deescalation and will end up absorbing all the negativity and wonder where it went wrong and what he could have done differently. It's like it's an impulse for him to fix it all and reason it all out. 


Problem? A large percentage of the population experiences emotions that are both fleeting and don't make much sense sometimes, even to the people experiencing them. He has a hard time grasping this and will go haywire trying to analyze the situation and fix out all the kinks. He has to let that go if he doesn't want to lose his mind while dating someone.

ISTJ,"I been testing doing multitasking for years just to test if it can be a new suitable method to make my life a little bit easier. Based of my observation multitasking is not the best when comes to handling serious, big and important tasks like working on a job, school project and etc. That causes lost of concentration, distraction and it decrease efficiency so the good old one task at a time is the best way to do so. 

Multitasking can be good for doing basic and simple task like writing while listening to music or a podcast. This is where I use that method in my daily routine it may be increase my productivity to get the job done a little more faster. Just gonna keep practicing it.


In my conclusion from all the years of trying to multitask:

Doing atleast 2-3 basic task at the same time as long each one of them doesn't require a lot of concentration and energy

I‚Äôve grown to like him but I‚Äôve cut him off a few times because his actions really don‚Äôt match his words imo. He‚Äôs taken me on very nice dates etc. however I feel like I‚Äôm constantly the one who has to start a conversation with him. If I text him, he‚Äôll respond soon after. And when I call him, he always picks up and we talk for hours. I don‚Äôt mind initiating (as an ENFJ) but as a woman, it does make me feel like I‚Äôm in the masculine role. We‚Äôve been having very frequent calls recently - on Friday after a 1hr15min phone call (which consisted of him telling me how he‚Äôll never find another girl like me etc)  he said ‚ÄúI appreciate you calling me, I‚Äôll make sure to call you in 1-2 days‚Äù it‚Äôs now been almost a week and I‚Äôm confused as to why I haven‚Äôt heard from him.

I‚Äôm trying to give him space so I don‚Äôt text him to bother him but just wondering what this sudden silence means? About a week back I did for the first time overtly flirt by telling him I enjoyed spending time with him and then this happens. Prior to that I would banter and all but not really flirt(from my pov). We have not gone on a date but have regular one on one time talking before class. However he regularly views my Snapchat which is not private despite not texting me or following me on Snapchat!

ISTJ,"I know that it's not ideal to be asking for career advice in a forum, but I'm not losing anything by trying. Also, I'm almost completely sure about being ISTJ.

At the moment I'm in my second semester of a Natural Sciences and Mathematics College and I'm really struggling with my vocation. Since the last year of high school I've been experiencing serious doubts about what career path to choose, and when I finally decided to follow the Astrophysics path I wasn't accepted (my grade on the standardized test was too low), so I entered in the career I mentioned earlier with the hope of moving to the one I want after 2 years.

Well, long story short, I currently am full of doubt as to whether I should continue this route. My marks aren't very good. Nevertheless, I think that the vocation problem is not directly caused by my marks, but that they just summed up to my prevailing doubts. I mean, I know it looks like I'm facing my first obstacle and I just don't want to make my way through it, and maybe it is like that, but I don't think it is. I just don't want to do Astrophysics or any other academic career, I really don't like the idea of working in academia and all of that.

During my ""study"" (just reading a lot of forums, etc.) of MBTI type I've read several times of careers like accounting being almost like the ideal ISTJ career, but I'm not sure if I should go that way. In theory, I think that accounting matches my personality very well (low creativity and love for routine, order and stability), but it's a big change from the ""basic sciences route"". Also, there's no accounting major in my university, so I don't have the option of just taking courses and eventually moving to an accounting program. I would have to change to other university and start from zero (or almost from zero).

Should I go with the safe route of accounting? Is it really so perfect a match with ISTJs? Or maybe you can recommend me some other career. I know that every ISTJ isn't the same, but I would really appreciate your opinions.

I then asked to talk to him the next day, and when I told him face to face, he still thought it was bullshit.  I then proceeded to send him a very direct message which basically said something like:""I like you, you absolute dumbass"".  And I *think* he got the message after that.

A few hours after seeing that message, he sent me a message saying that he read the confession I sent him *for the first time* ( it was very long).  And he said he felt like it ""deserved a proper reply"", and would get back to me after we finish our exams.

ISTJ,"I have an ISTJ parent with whom I absolutely do NOT get along. She's definitely an unhealthy type (given her age, I think her _fear_ of new things etc. is beyond rational - also she's living an extremely socially/experience-isolated life full of biases which is not helping) and she goes through her INFJ demon a lot (I think my behaviour kinda triggers it) - basically getting incredibly hostile if you do something she adviced you (er, ordered) not to do and it fails. I get to listen about it for yeeears afterwards.

The problem is that as a result of this I have to hide and _lie_ about things I am/was onto which feels unauthentic and really uncomfortable to me, esp. cuz she seems to know I am lying anyway if I don't act it out flawlessly, so it's in a way pointless (basically I am ""risk"" prone from SiNe PoV but I _need_ to learn from experience, and her views are skewed - she bases her advices on ""what all could go wrong and therefore I shouldn't even try"" - and mind you, it's not objectively risky things - even talking about aiming to make a bussines is somehow wrong from her PoV as she values the 5-8 thing). 

I am past my 20s btw and basically an adult but the judgement I receive make me doubt how much I want to be ""friendly"" / in-touch with her. Also sorry, I don't know my type, although based of this scenario and my lengthy ramblings someone suggested NeSi, ENFP.

I am kind of curious about my options here because - keep in mind - she's definitely an unhealthy ISTJ, she can be extremely damaging to her close surrounding (in this case me and her EN(T)P partner who seems kinda drained from her too), but afaik she's not damaging to herself (she seems alright the way she is). My family is pretty damn small and I don't exactly want to cut her off as I do need some ""links"" for stability too but at the same time she's extremely damaging to my mental health.

Reasoning with her is pretty much impossible (she is not interested in hearing the opposite side of the story) but given how incompatible we are maybe there's something that's escaping my attention? I already tried to assert myself but that's like talking to a wall, she can even go as far as threaten me with scenarios that she will do if I do this and that (scenarios that have zero impact on her).

ISTJ,"I am a good listener and have a very calm energy that seems to invite people to emotionally vomit on me often. I feel like friends, family, and acquaintances are unloading all of these unnecessary details on me when we have a conversation because they know I will listen. I work in a field where I listen to people all day. Even though I set boundaries, it still seems to happen with everyone around me. 

I take the stance that if someone is talking a lot in conservation or detailed with their stories then they must have some type of internal need to communicate at that moment. Therefore I am quiet and just ask them follow up details to engage. I don't interject about my day or how I relate to that conversation, and I never unload my emotional baggage on people. When I do start to talk and I am interrupted I will just let it go. However, lately that is getting harder to do. Every time I am interrupted, or I walk away from a conversation feeling like someone just vomited their life all over me I feel this sort of yucky rage. 

I don't want to fight for a conversation to be two sided. I feel like people are constantly taking from my bucket of energy and not giving anything in return.

As soon as a guy (potential love interest) displays what I consider to be clingy behavior, before you‚Äôve even gone on an actual date, I‚Äôm *out of there*, or at the very least slow way down and get kind of distant to force him him cool his jets.

I‚Äôm talking about them wanting to talk to you too often via texting or talking on the phone, or snap you a lot, or interact frequently and quickly   On social media etc. always wanting to know what you‚Äôre up to, and if you post on social media they immediately contact you and want to know why you are not responding.

I think most people would consider this a ‚Äúyellow flag‚Äù but I feel like it‚Äôs a big honking Red one that has flashing lights and makes noises.

She likes to organize things, if there's need for prints she collecs the money. Sits the other classroom's side, our career (Management) is pretty much girls and few boys. She appears to avoid social interaction with others, the group around her is quite sociable and only talks to them if there's work to do, in spare time and recess she's just on the phone or writting things.

Last class we had our team (2 girls incluiding her and another guy) assigned to made an exposition. We tend to group  near my seat, they got near where I was and I proceed to I ask her if she memorize her assigned concepts and she begin to talk fast on how she was struggling, and I freaked out because I had this image of her being super quiet and calm. I offered my help to explain the concepts and she accepted (I'm worthy c:).

The rest of the class she was pretty colaborative with me, asking me things all the time, etc. After we exposure she sat near to me while other teams exposed and I started to freak out even more, why? She was being friendly towards me, I expected that from everybody else but not her.

At the end of the class (which was our last one) our teacher assigned us homework team, I was telling her I would do my part, her the other, etc. At departure time she overextended her talk and started to telling me things from far. At the end of the day she offered herself to do it alone (the other 2 did nothing lol) and I accepted just because of her kindness. I need to clarify I'm an ENTP but far from the stereotype. Yes, I used to be that smartass asshole everybody knows about, but now i'm different, more relaxed and learned to be patient, went from a cold ass to a pretty sociable one. My heart melted with that girl.

During my architecture degree in university, I always struggled coming up with design ideas. I tend to research further and read more  books to find the answer, yet I‚Äôve always felt like I‚Äôm nowhere near it. I think I‚Äôve always end up overthinking instead of producing work. 

At work, the overthinking still continues on lol, I don‚Äôt know when to stop designing or if it is good enough but thankfully so far my boss basically made that decision for me. I realize that I‚Äôm not experienced yet and I‚Äôm still learning.

When i saw her i think i should date her cause she looks cute and very nice to other people. We always hangout together with other co worker, because i'm not that brave i never made any move on her, at best i only help her and listen to her story or rant everyday.
After we get close enough and we start hangout more often she start to shed some of her past and it's kinda sad how she always mistreated, or being bullied even by her own siblings and her parent doesn't care about her. And she is malnourished to the point she has a petite and frail body despite her age. Right now she is on her own because she want to be indpendent from her family and find a good man to care for her she has almost 20 ex boyfriend because she kinda need a ""man's love"" ( i don't know what that mean)
Suddenly my mind switch from i want to bang this girl to i need to protect this girl, and just like that my crush for her suddenly gone and since then i've become a very good friend toward her, she always being belittled by the senior co worker so most of the time i tried to help her sort her problem.

ISTJ,"I am an emotional ENFP female with ADD (I know... I'm very scary) beside that I come from a family who's not afraid of raising their voices when upset. Bottomline is that I have been working on containing my emotions, among other practical things. I'm extremely aware of my shortcomings and I've been working on changing my ways since I can remember. A big part of my upbringing consisted of analysing our fights and feelings together until we all we're on the same page and felt good about things again.

That process is very important to me when it comes to having close relationships. I don't expect others to be good at it nor do I demand it but it matters to me that someone at least want to try and that we over time evolve and improve.

I'm in a relationship with an ISTJ male, whom I love and respect so much. I hate to affect him in any negative way and I strive to make this relationship as comfortable and satisfying for him as possible. It's the best one I've ever had and he is amazing. 

But when it comes to conflict we handle things completely differently and we respond in completely different ways. I want us to understand each other and learn from the fight so that it might not come up again. He feels like it's all criticism and can't help but to become defensive and/or shut down. Especially when I get emotional, something that he does not have  respect for and can not bring himself to be empathetic. It's understandable, I wish I wouldn't get so loud and 'a lot'. 

The ""not be empathetic"" part applies whether or not I'm able to be collected and concise. His own feelings becomes the focus and gets in the way of us understanding each other. Everytime that I try to express a concern of mine it turns into a discussion because of the fact that he always feel like he hasn't been mean nor have had bad intentions, which I never suggest that he had/has been, therefore he very rarely feel like my concern is valid. Whenever I've been emotional he again doesn't feel like he's done anything since I, in his mind, have done something worse. No matter what was said. My words doesn't mean much, it's my actions. To me it's the opposite.

I constantly work on these things that I know is very draining for him because I hear him and understand. I give him space, I try my best to give him time when he wants to move on and/or shut down. I'm also able to take critisism as long as it's somewhat logical and not just butthurtness or bitterness. I want it so that I know how to make him happy, not to the point of losing myself as a person of course. But he's not able to give that back to me in any sense.

I take it as a lack of mutual respect and understanding. He's not able to see 'me' for what I am and mean without projecting himself and his way of being. I've tried to show him, to explain in so many ways but it doesn't stick. I know that he wants to but he just have a really hard time hearing me out without feeling like he has to protect himself. Therefore we just end up having a discussion which turn in to these heavy fights. In the end I've cried a whole lot and he's bitter/empty. The more we fight the more I want to get through to him and be close, for him it's the opposite he creates distance and want it. It becomes a matter of him vs me and I hate that (as much as he hates my bad temper), it honestly breaks my heart in so many ways because my intentions always are to fix something so that we'll have a better chance in the long run. It gets very hard to work on controlling my temper when I'm not met with the same mindset. I know that he tries hard and that he wants to do ""good"" but some times his version of that doesn't fit with my needs vice versa. The difference is that I see him for him, I love every part of it and I know what I should do to make him happier. But he doesn't when it comes to him being defensive.

My question is: Can I make him see my side of things? How do I get through to him so that he won't become defensive and am able to understand that my intentions are not to attack him? Because no matter how calm I'm able to be I just don't seem to make him see me nor empathize and respect our differences.

I truly wish that I would be better at keeping things short and cute, I know how much a lot of you hate long outdrawn texts. I hope some of you manage to get through it though... heh.",1567426989

Social anxiety is something I've slowly taken care of and fix.

But after years and years of being alone all of the time, I'm loosing the habit and the method in order to make friends / find a romantic partner.

I'm only 22 and in college. Solitude is turning into isolation and isolation is more dangerous than I expected it to be.

ISTJ," 

Okay, so my fiance (let's call him Axel, ISTJ) is feeling really threatened by a friend of mine (let's call her Moon, INFJ). both she and my INTJ friend have made jokes/comments about her and i being lesbians etc  and Moon told me that she mentioned to her therapist (jokingly) that while Axel was good for me, he ""got in her way"" of dating me, etc. though with the frequency of said jokes, part of me feels like it‚Äôs not a joke at all. 

it's no secret between her and i that there is some kind of attraction between us on some level, for various reasons, though we've decided that we're (obviously) better off friends.   

&amp;#x200B;

Moon is 17 and I'm 23 (which makes this super yikes and I‚Äôm kinda ashamed that this is even a thing in my life), though she's mature for her age in most circumstances. Even if she were 18 and Axel weren‚Äôt present in my life, I would not necessarily be comfortable being in a romantic situation where I would have so much potential power over her due to the age gap. However, due to the strong sense of connection we have, I‚Äôve felt when we talk alone in person (ie over the past few days, as she's visiting) that if I were not with Axel I would be with her (which is making me gag to think about).

The reason is this: she's the same personality type as me and we are able to vibe a lot emotionally, in ways that i find difficult/impossible with other people. we both make each other feel sane and understood, which is huge for us both emotionally. I have a love/hate relationship with coming to terms with the fact that i may be bisexual, and sometimes my curiosity and desire to know what certain things are like are stronger than others. When I‚Äôm with Moon I don‚Äôt have to filter what I‚Äôm saying for an audience, and I‚Äôm not afraid of being misunderstood. We speak the same emotional language, and until she came down here, I didn‚Äôt realize how much I‚Äôd been missing that kind of connection. Moon and I see things the same way a lot, and get excited about the same things, and the appeal of that, coupled with the sexuality thing, is difficult for me to ignore.  


  
this is where Axel comes in. I want to have that kind of emotional connection with him, but i have a really hard time talking about or even thinking of talking about the kinds of things i talk about with Moon (it just doesn't enter my mind much) with him. I think this is because i'm afraid of not being understood, not being engaged in conversation, of being dismissed, and/or being belittled. 

Axel wants me to be myself around him and i want to have that deep, open connection we used to have before i went to college but i have to constantly fight the feeling like if i say something he won't understand or he'll argue with me or be upset about something -- which is a holdover from family relationships and (possibly) the fact that he can be very unaware of how his reactions affect me -- and the fact that how he means for a thing to come across doesn't come across that way. 

but he is trying.  he told me how threatened he felt by Moon even though he knows he wouldn't lose me to her; he does not want to interact with her (or INTJ friend) in person because he knows he'd react negatively to any comments like the above made in his presence (like me and Moon being lesbians/INTJ being wendy's wingman to get with me, etc) He doesn't want to bar me from seeing my friends, but it's difficult for him not to feel upset about all this, and he wants to avoid an outcome in which he tells Moon to leave me alone, because he knows how much i value her friendship. He doesn't want to be that guy, which is nice.

  
He and I both want to work on our communication/emotional availability. It‚Äôs just really taxing and I feel like we‚Äôll never get there. I can‚Äôt force john to be something he‚Äôs not, and with the research I‚Äôve done online about our personality types (he‚Äôs ISTJ, I‚Äôm INFJ), we‚Äôre total opposites in this regard and that‚Äôs unlikely to change. I might have to just deal with the fact that certain kinds of emotional satisfaction will have to come from elsewhere, as much as that hurts and as much as I hate it (because he wants to be there for me. He wants to be my rock and resource, and it kills me to feel that he can‚Äôt be that for me).   

Anyway. That‚Äôs about it. This sucks and I hate it, but I love everyone involved so much. I need some guidance on how to establish the kind of connection with Axel that I crave (or at least make progress toward it). He is, to clarify, supportive of whatever sexuality I might be, but is not comfortable with any kind of experimentation/open relationship, and nor necessarily am I. He's been cheated on in the past and even if we were to both agree on it I feel like that would cause to much of an emotional rift between us and I can't do that to him.",1566401951
ISTJ,"I have an ISTJ boss who is an editor. In the past, editors usually make changes to the text themselves unless they need clarification on what the writer is trying to say. However, a complaint all of us have of this editor is that he will write passive aggressive comments or questions instead. For example, I wrote a sentence about sleep walking and used the phrase ""buttered cigarettes."" He wrote, ""this makes is sound like it's sold in stores, please rephrase."" Another editor would have understood what was going on and probably just edited it himself by changing the sentence to something like ""the patient will often eat cigarettes that they have buttered in their sleep"" or something like that. He does this to all the staff and he has told me that he thinks I'm very smart so I don't think this is personal, but I'd also like to understand what he's possibly thinking when he does this.

Is he a) not wanting to make any assumptions and paranoid that he will write the wrong thing b) trying to teach us by making us answer and re-write rather than just fixing it himself c) trying to be respectful by not touching the copy itself and giving us an opportunity to fix? d) some other reason (please elaborate if so).

ISTJ,"I'm an INTP (Male)person.I've known i was an INTP since I was in secondary school. My dilemma is that I want to choose a person,who I can best give my attention with for life.I know that marrying the wrong partner can be exhausting.

Backstory,I had an ISTJ ex-GF, we broke up because she went abroad. My Ex and I recently had a chat, something in me wants her to be my partner for life because we connect.I know that we compliment each other .From my understanding ISTJ can be very detail-oriented which can drive INTPs crazy but can help in tons of ways. Conversations can hit dead end with ISTJ but we learned to show intimacy to each other by opening up.

My current gf is an ISFJ.As the saying goes ""Behind every successful man is an ISFJ that took care of that man"" ISFJ gf is super caring..no problem what so ever.I had good personal growth with ISFJ .  I learned how to deal with her quirks but sometimes life with ISFJ can be very ""bland"" but bland is sometimes okay..sometimes it's not..Nonetheless ISFJ Gf is very caring which is a big plus.

We talked about things that happened and I told him some facts, which I know ISTJ's like. What bothers me is that he doesn't iniciate a lot of things, I feel it's always me making the first move...i keep doubting myself and feeling dumb. He's away now for a bit so I'm stuck waiting to see if he'll text or want to meet when he gets back. My emotional self is stuck on trying to analize everything and feeling too much.


So I have few questions:
1. How to tell if an ISTJ is 'really' into you? 
2. How to express my own feelings towards an ISTJ?
3. Is it common for an ISTJ to always wait for the other side to make a first move? 
4. How do you behave when you like someone, do you go for it (send texts, invite people out...) or do you retreat and wait more often?

ISTJ,"mildly drunk post. Key word on mildly, please don't judge me too harsh senpais.

I absolutely love ISTJ's. I think it's the most ideal partner. It's so amazing to gain their trust and respect because it's just so hard! They have such keen eye to detect red flags within people even now im a little bit anxious if they will see one within me. But I still love you. In fact, I find ISTJ's so amazing I even married one haha. It upsets me to see that when ISTJ's get categorised as ""boring"" and ""robots"" and other baseless statements, and it upsets me even more because even many ISTJ's themselves will agree with those statements! It's not that you're boring, it's just you're one of the LEAST phoney personalities, and phoney people are usually considered more interesting due to risky and/or loud and exagerated behaviours.  Mostly, ISTJ's are very punctual, dedicated, know what they want, and their Te functions helps them achieve many things and unlike, ehem, many of us, they actually put things to action. I'm the opposite of that and sometimes I'm just in awe, thinking my husband is some kind of superhero or something. He brushes it off like it's nothing, not taking the compliments ( and i noticed many ISTJs do that, as they consider punctuality and duty something easy and what everyone can and should do) but not only it's fascinating to me, it's hella attractive. I noticed many ISTJs also have a hobby that they are borderline obsessed with, (Lets say video games, hunting, pc, traveling and etc. Doesn't matter exactly which) and when you talk with them about their hobby, it's like talking with the most sparkly eyed happy child haha. for example me and other Ne function personalities, we just simply can't settle on a hobby. Our ""hobby"" is considering what hobbies to have lol.

I love how ISTJ's appreciate your integrity and if they respect you and love you, they will do ANYTHING for you, even if (in my case) you are very VERY annoying and messy. Best part? I can see how happy it makes them to perform actions for their loved ones. I sometimes don't even need help, but ask my husband simple tasks anyway because I know he takes pleasure from it. When ISTJ loves you, they believe in showing you with their actions instead of just words. Um, hello? Dream lover personality trait right here. In this world, there is only two ISTJs im very close with, my husband and one of my friends, and these are the ONLY 2 people I can be relaxed and secure with, knowing that we don't have to mindlessly chit chat, be obnoxious/phoney or do risky things to have fun and appreciate each other. Although I do get annoyed when they brush me off once I act more r/iamverysmart and rebelious haha. Ah, anyways, If only you could see your personality from my eyes. As dumb as I sound, for me, you are a superhero. I both need you in my life and I admire you. Please if you have confidence issues, remember my feelings and know that there are MANY like me and we NEED you and admire you, only if some of you would open up more, it's so damn hard to truly gain your friendship and know what you're really feeling half of the time haha.

I recently became interested in MBTI and Cognitive Functions. I used to always test as an INTP, but through research I've discovered that I am definitely an ISTJ.

&amp;#x200B;

This has hit me rather hard. There are vanity reasons of course, but I won't go into that.

I guess I have Intuitive envy. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like a robot, trapped by my programming, unable to think outside of it. I've always yearned to create. I don't mean simply draw, play music or write. These involve learning a skill and 'copying'.  I mean actually create something from within and display it. Ex-Nihlo. Originality. Creating something beautiful that has never existed before. 

&amp;#x200B;

But am I truly capable of that as an Si-dom? Am I reliant only on my past experiences and what is actual to mould into something new? 

&amp;#x200B;

This is the thought that plagued my mind last night.

If reality were a simulation, I would simply be part of that simulation. Constructed by it, controlled by it, formed by it. I would not have an essence outside of it. Perhaps that would be all of humanity. But to me, the Intuitives would be the exception. They have something other. 'The spark of the divine'.  Not fully constrained by this reality.

&amp;#x200B;

I yearn for discovery of what is new and beyond our understanding. However, it seems this is not something my type is usually involved in.

I've always been trapped within my own mind. But I believe that's just introversion. Now I feel truly trapped by the limitations of my mind.

Your 'responsible person' role becomes sth ppl take u for granted for, I'm talking more about close relationships since they hit the core.. In a work setting I feel this could be stopped due to laws. 

The fact we don't show emotions gets used... I've had experiences with close ppl who'd fake emotions just to win an argument and I was perceived as the bad guy by others around (all ppl I stood up for in many ways).. When infact I was the victim of assult.. (sometimes even physical)

Or all in all they build an expectation that you're logical responsible and don't feel much anyway so even if you're the victim, it doesn't matter.. It just plays against u? 

Do you recognize these aspects? 

It seems like I don't know how to deal with it, perhaps I'm too immature or my vision is limited or just too dim.. 

I've been through undesirable situations recently where even though I've invested money and time for ppl in my circle to guarantee their well being (job wise, school wise, health wise, financially etc)... I found out the hard way that I shouldn't have.. 

Perhaps my circle is just bad, but it's frequent enough to tell me the problem might be me...

My SO really does care about my health, but here‚Äôs the thing: if I tell him I‚Äôm not feeling great, he gets stressed out and then actually takes it out on me and makes things worse for me. In a way, it seems like he blames me for how I‚Äôm feeling. Like, ‚ÄúWhy did you let yourself get sick? You should have prevented that!‚Äù 

So I stopped telling him whenever I was feeling sick. But then yesterday he saw me taking my medication, so I had to tell him I haven‚Äôt been feeling great. He was very upset (mad) that I hadn‚Äôt told him I wasn‚Äôt feeling good. Basically, it seems as though I have no choice but to either lie to him about how I‚Äôm feeling or just let him get stressed out about it and take it out on me. 

This scares me for the future. I love him, but I don‚Äôt know if he is capable of caring for me if my lupus gets worse and I actually need something from him. The worst thing I can imagine is that I‚Äôm fighting for my life and my partner is taking his stress out on me. It may never get to that point, but if it does, I‚Äôm not sure i want him by my side. 

Finally, my questions: have you had to take care of another person before? How did you react to that? What part of your personality makes you a good/bad caretaker?",1563767540
ISTJ,"So yeah, for reference I‚Äôm an 18 y/o ISFJ and he‚Äôs a 20 y/o ISTJ (I think... I‚Äôve tried typing him myself). We met about a month ago since we‚Äôre both on the team for a religious retreat that‚Äôs happening next weekend. I‚Äôve gotten to know him as we‚Äôve planned this and we seem to think the same way and have similar interests.

A couple nights ago, we were at a religious event together and our two friends had to leave, so it was just the two of us for about an hour. It was slightly awkward at first (being two introverts after all) but he was standing at his keyboard and was showing me cool songs he knows how to play. Then we just spent an hour showing each other music we really like and joking around.

I think we‚Äôd get along really well, but I‚Äôm not sure how or if I should ask him out. I don‚Äôt have as much time left to work up to it as I would‚Äôve liked since the retreat is next weekend and we‚Äôre going to stop having team meetings after that. We haven‚Äôt had much one-on-one interaction aside from that evening, so I don‚Äôt want to seem too forward by asking him out. Especially since SJs are pretty traditionalist, I feel like we‚Äôd both feel like the guy should ask the girl out. 

Also, I‚Äôm worried about what we should do on a date (if he says yes). I can be quiet when I‚Äôm still getting to know someone and I don‚Äôt want it to be super awkward. He doesn‚Äôt seem to be very talkative either.

ISTJ,"Whether friend or coworker, the INF* CAN be an irritant.  Sometimes they are helpful, others not so much.  So how do you let them know when they aren't being helpful?  I'm here to help with that.

INF* is asking how you're doing or is just ""checking in"" more than once.  This person either believes you may be having an issue and is trying to give you a chance to talk, OR is trying to engage you because they have something they want to talk about.  

ISTJ typical response.  ""I'm fine"" followed with a slight nod.  Intended or not we tend to see this as a red flag.  Why?  Cause if the INF* does this, something is probably wrong.  It's too short, sweet, and impersonal and this does not register as a genuine human response to us.  In fact if we do that, you're probably on our sh*t list (not necessarily though).  

As an INFP, it's really more about the tone of voice.  If the tone of voice does not seem authentic to me, I won't ""feel"" like you're being honest with me.  Not sure precisely on the INFJ, but I think it would be similar.  /u/TK4442 may be able to offer more perspective from INFJ side.

How to fix?

Slightly life the tone of your voice to just above your normal range.  Not much.  Too much and it'll seem inauthentic.  

Say:  ""Doing pretty good today, thanks.  Just got tons of work"" and offer a slight smile but then go back to focus on your task.

If the INF* continues to speak, when you get a chance say something like:

""Sorry I'm pretty busy.  Hate to be rude, but I really need to focus on this.""

By doing this, you're acknowledging to us that your recognize your abrupt rudeness, but the urgency of your work takes precedence.  This registers as a much more authentic reply.  

Unfortunately this may only end up being a delay tactic as we may continue to try.  If you have an INF* who simply won't take the hint, do the following:

""I'm sorry I just really prefer not to socialize at work.  Just a personality thing.  I'm not trying to be rude, I don't dislike you.  I merely prefer to be left to myself.""

On the last point, tone of voice is important.  Make a special effort to sound genuine.  We will (most likely) get the message and stop and it'll create the least amount of future problems.  

Special note, the above will NOT work with some of the other types.  ENFPs may even take your lack of interest as a challenge.",1563557556

ISTJ,"Greetings Reddit,
Here I am attempting my first post. 

Through being an ISTJ, it has become clear to me that we are usually workhorses, on some personal quest to fulfil some greater purpose. 

This has worked reasonably for me in the past, as I failed to develop emotions, didn't have time for anyone, and worked myself into the ground üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

After being cheated on and lied to by an ENFJ, I have found myself to be floundering around in some sort of disorientation, not knowing what my purpose is, or should be. Taking it hard would be an understatement. 

This lack of purpose, seems to sit very poorly for me, where it makes me feel less worthy and has destroyed my self confidence, as usually I take pride in what I do. The trouble is, I need to believe in the cause. 

Any one else had any experiences like this, when that 'purpose' is removed?
Issues with self confidence? 
Believing in thyself?
Where to from here?

ISTJ,"The job I currently do involves riding around in a truck, calling customers up to let them know I'm coming to remove junk from their houses. My boss bids these jobs on a best-case basis, as if the trash / sheetrock / couches would simply jump from its position into the truck, on its own accord. He also times these jobs on a similar assumption. 

When we had only the one truck and slower business (5-10K in weekly revenue), it didn't matter so much that we couldn't remove debris exactly within the designated time due to the house layout, employee health, sheer number of small items, etc. We could manage all of that and still get to the next job on time. Now that we're trying to rake in 15-20K in revenue every week, it seems like there's never enough time to do everything properly, and it's getting to me a *loooot*. Moreover, my boss likes to manage by the seat of his pants: he often dumps more work onto the day's schedule at the last second, constantly underbids job sizes (i.e: a demolition that was supposed to fill three trucks actually fills six of them), all while expecting his ground crews to operate at 100% efficiency, 100% of the time, six days a week. As a crew chief, I know that's bullshit.

Needless to say, the last six months of revenue growth have been wearing on my nerves, patience, and liver. I've never snapped at a customer, but I find myself becoming more and more angry and terse with my coworkers without meaning to be, and right now I just feel like all my brakes are starting to go out.

ISTJ,"INFJ female here, needing a little insight with my ISTJ husband of 4 years. 

I am very happily married and absolutely love his many positive qualities. He's even-natured, a wonderful father, a caring spouse, has a great sense of humor, is a hard worker who excels at his job... I could go on and on. He is a really wonderful person to have as a life partner. 

My one issue in my relationship with him (seriously, his one frustrating trait) is that he's not one to take initiative. Not with sex or anything else. He just leaves nearly every decision of our life together up to me and it's like pulling teeth trying to get an opinion or preference out of him. I know he has an opinion though, because he's very independent. But it's like he's not willing to initiate something or put his opinion out there in case it's criticized or I'm otherwise unhappy with what he's suggested. Like the notion of my rejection of him (that I wouldn't be pleased with the restaurant he chooses or where we go on a road trip or what we do in bed, or with his suggestion for how we approach disciplining our daughter or managing our money) is just unbearable. I know his mom was very critical and overbearing, so maybe it's just in response to that. I see myself as a reasonably supportive spouse, however,  who would be fine with any number of approaches (as long as I have a clear *why*), so this is so puzzling to me.  He's also very easygoing and maybe isn't as keen on the *why's* as I am, so it could be possible that he's stepped back so as not to have to hash things out- maybe he just can't be bothered, I don't know.

Is this a trait ISTJ's tend to deal with? I thought I'd rule out the influence of personality before looking into other explanations for what's going on

I realized that AFAIK, I haven't woken up ""naturally"" since I started using an alarm about a decade ago in high school. I still remember how hard it was to adjust to waking up to an alarm, but ever since then, it's just become my routine. I also don't even wake up at the same time everyday. Sometimes I have my alarm set early like 0700 if I have to get up for something, but then even on days when I don't have anything that MUST be done at a certain time, I realize I set an alarm for say 1000 or 1100. 

I'm thinking it's because I have some sort of anxiety about sleeping the entire day away. I used to basically become nocturnal on the weekend during the school year. Essentially playing games or hanging with friends until the early hours in the morning and then not waking up until 1500 or 1600. 

For example, tomorrow I'm off from work and most friends are working their normal 9-5. I don't really have any cleaning/chores etc that MUST be done, yet I can't bring myself to go to sleep without setting that alarm.

I could maybe understand it moreso if I was one of those people that have to have their day scheduled out to the minute, but I am not like that. I have a general routine for stuff, but I don't plan my day out or what time this or that must be done etc.  It just seems to only happen with the alarm to wake up.

ISTJ,"I've typed as ISFJ for years now, but for a variety of reasons I've started to question that typing and wonder if I might be an ISTJ instead.

I'm a woman, and part of me feels like I'm just a feminine-leaning ISTJ instead of an ISFJ. As I've come to learn more about cognitive functions, I really question whether I have Fe at all. I just don't relate to much of what I read about Fe. People who know me in person have said that I come off as cold and aloof. I always just chalked that up to shyness/awkwardness, but now I'm wondering if it's lack of Fe.

I also took this [cognitive function test](https://www.idrlabs.com/cognitive-function/test.php) and my top two functions were Si and Te. (My top four were Si Te Ni Fe, in that order, which is a nonexistent MBTI type lol. But Si and Te were by far the two most prominent functions.) The more I read about Te, the more I think I relate to that much more than Fe and that I'm an ISTJ instead of an ISFJ. When I've taken tests that broke down your scores for each letter, my I and J were extremely strong, S a little weaker, and T/J a near-even split. 

My one irl friend who knows MBTI typed me as INTJ and was shocked when she learned that I was a feeler. I have a few online friends who are well-versed in MBTI and don't think I'm an ISFJ either. And yet I consistently score ISFJ on every test I take (though, again, with a very weak F/T split.)

I'm curious if any of you (particularly the women here) have typed as ISFJ then realized you were actually ISTJ. Or just if any of you have any insights or readings that might help me figure this out. What, to you, are the main differences between ISFJ and ISTJ? What are ISTJ children like? What are ISTJ's like in relationships? Honestly I don't know much about ISTJ's, so it's blowing my mind a little bit to think I might be one, haha.

She doesn‚Äôt really share her emotions really, and isn‚Äôt very lovey-dovey. I had talked with her about it and she says she does feel those things, but that it‚Äôs mostly an internal thing for her.

She matches the idea of an ISTJ fairly well, as her dominant fuction (Si) is apparent in the way of bodily sensations. She needs a freezing cold room, not a lot of noise, does not like spicy food, and loved soft textures like blankets and jersey knit sheets. 

She is also very unconservative, despite the way she was raised, but is very stubborn to her ideals that she holds (socially liberal) as an ISTJ would. 

She is also kind of blunt in her language, and likes to think out loud in a way.

As a true ISTJ, I find myself overanalyzing and introspecting more than usual about myself and life in general and I find it difficult to share it with others which makes me feel a bit alienated from my friends/closed ones. As a result of which I found this sub and after following it for a few months, I can say that I feel my thoughts, processes, beliefs and practices are not as unusual as I thought they were.

Have you ever had experiences with friends or romantic interests whining around that you‚Äôre always working and don‚Äôt have time for them?

It‚Äôs been a pretty consistent narrative in all stages of my working life and I‚Äôm *soooo* tired of hearing it.

I only work a 40hr job, yes it‚Äôs an overnight shift and that can be difficult, but I have time.

The reality is is that they refuse to plan ahead, or simply don‚Äôt care enough to remember my off days.

So friend-wise I end up not getting invited to things when I AM OFF and free and would love to hangout(and get to feel super *excluded* which is fun), then Friends get irritated with me when I can‚Äôt grab brunch at the drop of a hat.

And then dating-wise guys get super emotional and act like the world is coming to an end if I don‚Äôt have time the next couple of days, or don‚Äôt want to leave straight from their place to go to work. It‚Äôs really unattractive.

ISTJ,"I can't believe I'm writing this, but I'm struggling with how to properly behave around this ISTJ woman I work with. Yes, did crush on her hard. About half a year ago I had worked up the courage to ask her to hang out; which seems about one and a half times the effort it takes for an average person to ask someone out on an actual date. She politely declined and I took that as her not being interested. I've since decided not to push it further. I would visit with her fairly regularly and we would talk. I don't think I've ever had more fun talking with someone. We have similar opinions and taste in movies and humor. Our conversations are very natural and that's rare for me. BUT... There are perplexing and confusing things about her behavior towards me. Like I've said, I've kinda given up on any romantic prospects, but I've tried to build a friendshipy where we are more comfortable and relaxed with each other. I would initiate conversations with her and she would be friendly and happy to talk, but it seemed I would do all the initiating. She will not approach me. I've seen her approach other co-workers for friendly conversations (ones I know share very little in common with her even), but not me. It makes me feel insecure about myself. What if she's secretly annoyed by me. Or what if I'm not very approachable. IDK. Sometimes it feels like she's very apathetic about me. Until I resolve to mind my own business and let her be. Then she'll start making comments to me in passing. Nothing substantial. Just small, friendly office banter. Normally no more than ten seconds and then she walks off. Next thing you know, I'm visiting her over my break. If only I knew what was really going on in her head. In many ways, I'm very prideful, so this is actually very costly for me to do socially. Yet, I find myself a fool at the first sign of affinity. What do you think is best? Should I just recluse myself and mind my business; maybe smile and greet when we cross paths?

ISTJ,"Hey friends, INTP f here been dating ISTJ for 1.5 years, 
we &lt;3 each other and think on a very similar wavelength.


That being said, we can both be shit at sharing emotions. 
I, after painful training  and therapy in my past, forced myself to get comfortable being vulnerable and having hard conversations and express *feelings* without lashing out Fe. So I like emotionally checking in with the emotionally aloof ISTJ to verbally make sure he's happy etc.


Anyway, he is complete ass at sharing emotions lol, I am his first girlfriend (we're 21 and 23) so I understand he has no experience sharing how he's feeling, but is there anything I can say or do that would make him feel more comfortable? Just for reference, we never fight. The most we fight is both of us getting a little annoyed about something dumb and then 5 minutes later we're fine


He's gotten much better since we began dating because I set the stage that the floor is always open for discussion and if anythings bothering him I wont get offended or upset, and i've held true to that, so he knows he can talk to me. Im very clear that I want direct communication so there's no guessing in our relationship


He shows he loves me by doing small things for me that make my life easier, and I love trying to do things for him to reciprocate as well as verbally telling him I appreciate everything he does for me.

ISTJ,"Hi there! I was wondering if anyone could give me some insights to how to tell if an ISTJ is to the very least, interested in someone? I've been friends with this ISTJ for awhile, though it did take him quite some time to warm up to me, which didn't really bother me at all. I'm an ENFP, with a lot of IXXX friends, so I guess I'm rather used to giving people time to open up? However I don't really know that many ISTJs, hence I am not that sure of how to detect subtle cues, etc. I guess in short, I am not quite sure of how to detect whether or not an ISTJ is ""interested"" in me.  


Like I was saying, the person took quite awhile to warm up to me. He started off as being very awkward around me, often giving me a few words as an answer to my questions, or at times just staring and nodding. Fast forward to our current situation, he is able to laugh freely around me and make jokes that at times only we would understand. I realised that he does not quite like socialising (oh wow huge realisation here!), but once we did have to participate in a social event together. Sadly enough we were split into different groups, but when the event required us to break out from our groups and just mingle around, I realised that he went straight to me. I don't know if this means anything. Me being me, I went around and made small talk with other people, and I'd always go back to him and he'd seem ""happy"" to see me, but completely disinterested in mingling with anyone else, other than me and 1/2 of our mutual friends (who were all guys). 

&amp;#x200B;

Due to our schedules we don't talk that much, we live pretty different lives, etc. However when we do talk, we'd talk for about 1-3 hours? Which even to me is rather long. He'd share a bit more about himself, joke around and stuff, the thing is I don't know if he's just being ""friendly,"" or if I should expect anything more. He did hinted that he is not particularly looking for a relationship right now, but I don't really think that he completely opposes the idea. In all honesty, I have liked him for quite awhile, I admire him for how determined and focus he is. In the end I'd be bumped if he is not interested, but I guess being friends is better than being strangers!! :)

Almost 2 months ago we secured a traditional lender.  We did so before property shopping.  Take a wild guess which one of us decided to be prepared ahead of time.

Anyway, we start shopping and we find a condo.  We prepare and send the lender all documentation required in a timely and efficient manner.  The condo has an HOA and the property is in a flood zone.  HOA has no master flood policy.  We inform lender of this well over a month before closing date.  We are assured that it's no problem as long as we have a flood insurance policy for ourselves.  Great, we buy one.

On Tuesday, the lender backs out for the stated reason, no master flood plan.  Won't listen, won't do anything, act like they did nothing wrong.  We're both incensed, frustrated, irritated, etc.  Now we're scambling to see if we can secure funding because we both really want this condo.

ISTJ,"Hey everyone, INFJ here. Was recently broken up with by my ISTJ, now ex, boyfriend, but I'm having some troubles processing some of what he said and I was hoping to get a bit of insight. 

&amp;#x200B;

The reason I was told for the breakup was that 1) he didn't feel he could love me and 2) he had this gut feeling that things wouldn't work even if we tried. We both also kind of felt that things were becoming a bit more friendship like than boyfriend/girlfriend like (to me, that was just something that came with time but wasn't a problem). However, he also agreed to really enjoy spending time with me, doing various activities, and having conversations. He agreed that we are compatible in a lot of ways, especially in our ability to empathize with each other's frustrations and pains when it comes to family trauma. He also said that he wants to be more like me (communicate better, connect with others), and I too felt that he inspired me in wanting to always be learning. So essentially, he agreed we both can grow from each other. And ultimately, he'd like to try and be friends (at least at the time that we spoke)  


So this information leaves me pretty confused. I feel like there's something else going on. There was a huge emphasis during our breakup about how I deserve better and that he hasn't been giving me enough. I know that could be brushed off as typically breakup language, but on top of that he also said a lot about being insecure in his ability to communicate and that it's 'hard being a human' and making connections (and he agreed that therapy is something that may be needed here). So together, that kind of made me think that this is more about him feeling like he's not enough. And that maybe this is more about him not being ready to commit to me at this time based on these things, but not about our relationship as it is.   


Now, I'm a bit divided here. I can accept that someone doesn't want to be in a relationship with me. It happens, it hurts, but life goes on. On the other hand, I really really just want to help him with whatever he's going through. As partners or as friends. I want him to learn to love himself and to learn more about what he wants and to be happy. I just don't want him to make all these discoveries only to recognize that I'd moved on (if that happened) and feel regret, because I honestly feel that outside of this we have quite a healthy relationship. I'm concerned about this being taken as me trying to stay together or as me trying to give myself false hope. And I also don't want to be disrespectful and have him feel that I don't believe his feelings when I'm trying to suggest this option for moving forwards. 

&amp;#x200B;

Would be really happy to get any advice on how to navigate this situation and how to best communicate my intentions.

ISTJ,"So, I'm an ISFJ. I've been recently observing my use of Si, in particular, its memorising capability.

I discovered that when memorising stuff, I tend to make connections with things I already know. But in a weirdly feeling way. For example, if I want to memorise this chemical reaction :

Cu + dilute HNO3 -------&gt; Cu(NO3)2  + NO + water

(unbalanced)

Basic principles of chemical reactions allow me to know that Cu(NO3)2 and water will be formed. But its hard for me to remember that **NO would be a byproduct** (for it can be any nitrogen oxide). So I try to make some connection to remember that. 

There's a brand of bottled water that adds trace amounts of copper (for a mineral taste, I guess) and I don't like the taste of it. In other words, I feel negatively about it. The word ""NO"" is a negative in the english language. Do you see the connection here? It does seem far fetched but it helps me remember things much easier.

 Basically what I do is **I connect the way I feel about certain things to the matter at hand**, in order to remember it. My question to the ISTJs is, do you guys use Si similarly or do you prefer to rely on logic instead of personal feelings to make connections? I'm curious because ISTJs have great thinking-feeling balance. Sorry if it was gibberish, it was quite hard to put into words.",1560518774
ISTJ,"Hey guys, just wondering whether you are also prioritizing yourself over basically everything else (selfish), have difficulties in finding the right partner (Super picky), always wanting to win in everything (ambitious af, hating to lose) you participate and trying to steer things to the way you want them to be (Manipulative)?  
I also care really hard what others think about me (Love getting credit for something) and I overthink every situation I'm in.",1560441853
ISTJ,"I'll try to describe myself without bias as much as possible.

I'm a 19 year old male. I'm a person who may seem cold at first, but is actually quite sensitive. I tend to think a lot about what other people think of me, the way I look, the way I do things. I'm generally very self-aware. This results in a lot of anxiety, but I do not have a disorder.

**My family:**

ESTJ mother - very caring, somewhat blunt, selfless, has many other traits that are very similar to mine.

ESFJ dad - way too altruistic for my taste, often ends up as a doormat for others to step on.

ENTJ brother - very controlling, stubborn, not very good at feelings.

Both of my parents are very hardworking, whereas me and my brother are a bit on the lazy side(possibly due to the fact that our parents took care of everything, even the smallest details).

Overall, my family is full of ""model citizens"", reliable, consistent, punctual. I did not have any past traumas and my family has always been great to me. My biggest problem with them is that, if they have strong beliefs about something, it's really hard to persuade them.

**School experience:**

Ever since elementary school I have always been one of the best students.

I particularly excel at subjects that either require me to memorize and link things together (history, chemistry) or ones that allow you to express your opinion (literature, languages, philosophy). Patterns are easy for me to understand.

On the other hand, math and physics have always been boring to me. It always felt like they were too vague or very specific, which I did not enjoy.

My memory is phenomenal.

Also, I've always been very athletic. Team sports that involve a ball have always been my bread and butter.

Teachers have always liked me due to my consistency, reliability. I would be given important assignments or projects because they knew that I‚Äôd be the guy who‚Äôd 100% do it and not let them down. I, on the other hand, would gasp a little and think ‚Äúnot this shit again‚Äù, but I would still accept politely because they relied on me.

In group projects I‚Äôm either the guy who does all the work on his own because others are fucking usuless or the person who assigns workloads to everyone and still has to correct 70% of what his group did.

**Friendships:**

In terms of friendships, the most popular people gravitated towards me despite me just being a ""normal"" kid. The aura around me has always been friendly and I‚Äôm quite approachable (even if my neutral facial expression makes you think otherwise).

I‚Äôve already mentioned that the popular kids were the ones who liked me. Normally, I‚Äôm kind of quiet and reserved, but I can talk like a machine if someone sparks my interest, which would often happen with those people. They probably liked me because I could match their energy.

I think my main friends changed like this: ENTJ &gt; ENTP &gt; ESTP &gt; INFJ. The newest one is mysterious, quiet, reserved. But overall very ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. I manage to make him talk despite his very introverted nature and he seems to enjoy my company as well. I have never had a dispute with him, both of us tend to avoid conflict and we simply discuss the differences between our views. Unsurprisingly, most of values are roughly the same.

I‚Äôm definitely not the type to get very drunk and be the soul of the party. I join in when everyone‚Äôs dancing, talk with people who are away from the action and ask them to join everyone, but parties don‚Äôt interest me much. I neither smoke, nor drink, which the popular folks are doing, which makes me feel a little like a misfit.

My ideal hangouts: going for coffee, going to a restaurant, going to the beach, going for a hike, doing sports together, especially team oriented ones, going for a walk together.

I prefer having a wider variety of people to hangout than just one good friend. It feels limiting to have only one or two.

I had this period of time, when I simply did not have any close friends for a few years in high school. I had a ton of acquaintances, but nobody with a genuine connection, which probably resulted in me becoming slightly more introverted, but I‚Äôm still not sure whether I‚Äôm an outgoing introvert or a somewhat reserved extrovert. Overall, I can talk both with very extroverted people and very introverted people, it often feels like I‚Äôm somewhere in the middle. Though, if I had to ever repeat the period of ‚Äúno close friends‚Äù, I‚Äôd probably go insane.

**Personality traits:**

I am a very clean and tidy person. I can‚Äôt seem to be able to focus if things are not where they belong. Dealing with messy people usually results in conflict.

I tend to take things to heart and overanalyze everything that is said. I‚Äôm a sensitive person.

If I don‚Äôt hold myself back, I can come off as a little blunt. I inadvertently offend people sometimes.

My type of humour is based on sarcasm, roasts and witty jokes.

I value people who honor commitments, are punctual, reliable, consistent. I tend to keep myself committed to an activity even if I had a change of heart.

I prefer it if things go according to plan, I like organizing stuff and get a little upset if something very unexpected happens.

I like trying new things, but I‚Äôm not sure how to explain this. I still prefer to be somewhat familiar with the subject at hand.

I tend to delve into existential questions a little too deep and get sad sometimes.

I'm extremely aware of my surroundings and it seems like I'm scanning for information all the time.

I don‚Äôt have strong opinions about religion, politics, sexuality or other similar topics. Most people think X or Y about them, but I just don‚Äôt really care.

I need external validation from other people just to make sure whether I'm doing well, look good and etc. Sometimes I become too needy.

I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm empathetic. I know when to listen and when to give advice, solutions to people, but I hate people who complain about anything and everything, especially if there‚Äôs a clear solution to their problems.

I bottle up my feelings for a long time and sometimes they explode after something minor, when I no longer can stand something and had to put up with it for a long time.

I dislike people who tend to behave very risky, have no sense of what is safe and unsafe to do. Extreme activities are not for me.

I think a lot about what others think of me, which results in unnecessary anxiety that I can‚Äôt seem to shake off.

I'm overly perfectionistic and get into the mindset ""it's either going to be perfect or I'd rather it didn't exist to begin with"".

I'm tolerant to others even if they aren't what I deem to be ""acceptable"" or even if they contradict me. Though, I‚Äôm still judging them inside my head a lot.

I enjoy helping, teaching others, but not too much.

**My current hobbies:**

Sports: biking, running, going to the gym, beach activities, playing team sports in general.

I like watching anime. Movies and TV shows as well.

Fashion. I like clothes, matching things together. I would not call myself a ""fashionista"", because I find those kind of people cringey and a little goofy looking.

I play the ukulele and sing, I‚Äôm above average at it, but not great.

**My views on the past, present and future:**

The past either makes me feel nostalgic for the good times or haunts me, reminds me of the bad things that happened and can happen in the future. I tend to draw inspiration from the past and think that if X happened, it can happen again. The present is here to kind of progress to the future, which I think will be better if I stay consistent and do things properly. It also scares me, because I think of a lot of things that could go wrong in the future.

**My thoughts on creativity, curiosity, procrastination:**

I'd say I'm more of a realist and I never really try doing things that I think are pointless and not possible to accomplish. So, I probably don't have more ideas than I can make come true. 

Though, I have a vision of what I want to accomplish in let's say 10-15 years or so. Mostly major things, such as graduating university, getting a job, pursuing my career and then maybe starting a business, running a caffe or opening a minimalist clothing shop. I'd like to fill business niches that are currently open where I live. I'm planning on studying marketing/communication.

If I find something interesting on the internet, I tend to research it a lot until I'm satisfied. For example, I've been obsessed with MBTI for 4 months and spend a few hours daily researching it. It happens with interesting TV shows or topics.

I'd say I'm not really the type to invent something completely new, but rather improve something that already exists and make it seem innovative.

I tend to procrastinate things a lot, but I will always turn in everything on time. My sense of duty is not a natural thing for me, but something like a social standard, expectation that I need to fulfill.",1560373938

ISTJ,"I didn't give details before because I didn't want my question tainted.  Some times people get focused on the details that they ignore the actual question.

Facts:  Married 28 years to an ISTJ.  He walked out on me 2.5 months ago.  We have 3 teenagers.
Teen 1:  INTJ, loner will spend time with him occasionally.
Teen 2:  INFJ - has door slammed him
Teen 3:  Haven't typed yet - only talks to him for money.

I am INTJ with mental illness which is why he left.  He says it's because I'm ""crazy"".  He has a valid reason for leaving.  I am okay with it.  In the past few years I finally found a dr who took me seriously.  Got on one med which stabilized me which helped A LOT but I still had issues every few months.  I knew I was depressed but didn't want to take any more pills (stupid).

After my husband left I knew I'd be depressed so I started taking the pills.  In a few days I felt like a completely different person.  My kids have told my husband this.  My husband has said the ONLY reason he would consider reconciling was because of the new med.  He said he would not come back if he knew nothing would change.  He's not wrong on this.  Nothing would change without treating the depression.  He's angry (he never gets angry) and said he just needed time.  He misses the kids but will not come back for them.  They ""might"" motivate him to try again...maybe.

Truly I'm not well enough to reconcile either.  I need time myself to work on my issues now that I can.  I want to know if you, an ISTJ would walk away permanently in this situation?  He has every right to and I wouldn't blame him one bit.  I was just wondering..",1560260645

ISTJ,"My older sister (ISTJ) has always had walls with me.

Where the confidence breach came was that I said my sister thought X. (I was more concerned with the relationship with the nephew - thinking about his actions.) My sister called me last Sunday, using my full name, and left a message but hasn't responded to calls or emails since. She has never given the silent treatment, but she has now, so it scares me. I don't fully understand emotionally because my natural tendency is to connect everyone I love, but I know that she sees Mom as someone she doesn't tell things to. She does not have friends outside of her immediate family, and her husband advises secrecy above most things as well and is not an advocate of her having outside relationships, even with me. There was an incident 15 years ago where I told a mutual friend that his dad had been in the hospital (I thought they could visit him), and there was a huge thing about me being a blabbermouth and me not being trustworthy - but I have about most things. What is the best way to fix things? I had talked to her earlier this year about trusting me more, so this is just terrible.

ISTJ,"One of my best friends is an ISTJ and I absolutely love her! She is so determined at work and has a strong set of values. 

We are quite close. We've been friends for over 5 years and she stood up in my wedding. But she has this habit of ghosting for months at a time. The last time it happened was maybe a few months after we met. I figured she just didn't want to pursue the friendship, but then I found out that her bf was being abusive. She didn't come to me or the other close friend in our friend group of three until after the fact. 

Now she's been ghosting again. I figure that if she needs space, she needs space, and I don't want to pressure her. But it's strange because she will be the one to reach out saying she wants to get together (online via Skype because she lives far away). I'll give her my availability but then she wont return the text. This has happened 3 or 4 times, several months apart, in the past year.

Sometimes I get the vibe that she doesn't want to chat if things are going poorly in her life. I'm a bit concerned because in all the time I've known her, she's never mentioned other friends that she talks to or hangs out with, even at work. So if my friend and I are the friends she's closet to, and she rarely talks to us, her level of social support is concerning. 

She's been dating a new bf for years, but in a lot of ways minimizes that relationship, almost as if she's hiding it. (We didn't meet him for years. No pictures of them together online or relationship status change.)

She used to catch up with us online at least once every 1-3 months regularly. All of the sudden in the past year, everything changed.

Is this just something characteristic of ISTJs or is this something different? What does this mean? Is there anything I should do or that you, as an ISTJ, would appreciate from a friend? I'd like to be supportive without being pushy or interrogative.  

Thank you in advance for your insight and perspective. As an aside, I think you guys rock! :)",1560028524

ISTJ,"* I attempt to never create mistakes or problems in the first place, that way I need not waste time cleaning up after myself.
* This is not my choice, but I really noticed this in school especially: I learn better by having made a bad mistake. It is then burnt into my mind and saved much faster than never having made the mistake.
* I am not against violence in entertainment, but I much rather play puzzle and logic games, than for instance shooters: The Legend of Zelda, Professor Layton, Ace Attorney (or in films: Inception is my favourite, due to different layers of reality)
* After noticing how problems are created solely due to how I react to things, I change my character:

I used to be very impatient; By coincidence there was one month were I had to wait for things all the time, so I thaught myself patience.

I used to be clumsier (Hand knocks a glass from a table accidentally and breaks it), so I taught myself to be more aware of my surroundings and careful of my movements.

* I am ""Sherlock Holmes organized"": Some lines of thought as to why some things are in certain places can be seen,  but some things appear out of place to people who aren't used to my room:

There is a hairdryer near my bed to keep warm, when its' cold. 

Individual unprocessed notes of things I must remember are found on my table, which I eventually write down into my phone and then throw the papers away.

Useful things that may be used in somewhat easily available situations can be found on my desk (David Mitchell calls it the man drawer): Skrewdrivers, Handkerchieves, Torch, said hairdryer, leftover medicines from earlier sicknesses, a cardboard fan, plasters, pen and notepad, micro-sd-card-adapter, sd-card and usb-stick etc.

Lots and lots of stress.  He talked about about wanting to run away.  He hated his life and was drinking heavily.

For 2 months he started planning to leave me.  This was a HIGHLY emotional decision.  He stated that I was ""crazy"" and that was why he wanted to divorce me.  Said all the stress wasn't the job it was me.  In his defense I was mildly depressed and didn't want to take any more pissed.

ISTJ,"I'm an ISTJ who enjoys structured design. This means I like organizing things, achieving a clear objective and working on projects where ""good"" is matter of fact instead of subjective.

As an example I've been doing product photography in-house for a few years now. Product photography is much more about engineering an image than it is about capturing a ""look"". I would be terrible at wedding, fashion or documentary photography because that's all about capturing emotion from real people. I prefer dealing with objects instead of people. I can make very good photos of objects but not people.

I have also worked on aspects of UI design. I have not been the web developer but I have advised on what colors to use to create certain pattens, etc. All of my design approach is template based. I've also done very simple geometric logos. These aren't exceptionally unique. They're solid but nothing people would pay a lot of money for. They are generic.

However my current job is likely coming to an end. And I'm debating what I should re-tool for. To be honest I feel like I'm not really a part of either world. All the ISTJ jobs typically listed are engineer/scientist/financial auditor. These jobs don't have any visual design aspect. On the other hand I will never be stand alone artist who draws a painting or illustration. No one will buy my work in a gallery. Also I'm introverted to the point that the free-lance salesmanship aspect of any design profession would probably preclude me from getting jobs.

ISTJ,"""What would you do"" questions:

\---

Ex 1) 

If someone tells me ""Hey, grab that cup."" I will without thinking about it.

My husband would, however, question ""why"" before ever picking the glass up. 

With simple things, I just do what I'm told basically. I can see it being somewhat ""passive,"" but I also see it as being helpful? Or wanting to get other's needs met. I basically run with the information I'm given and, in this case, assume the person must want the glass. 

Whereas my husband asks for as much info as possible. ""Why do I need to pick it up? Who is it for? Do you need this particular glass?"" And so on. 

\---

Ex 2)

My husband asked me what I would do if zombies came in the restaurant. I told him I would find a weapon and try to leave the area. 

When I asked my husband the same question he said ""how many zombies are here? can I leave the room? do I have access to the kitchen? etc."" before detailing what he would do. 

\---

Ex 3)

I asked my husband how he would build a house. He said, ""How many people are living there? Where will it be located?"" etc. before going into the details of what he would do. It's like he needed info to be able to start. When I told him ""you aren't given any of that info on this,"" he said, ""then I'm just going to build a house that I would want."" 

&amp;#x200B;

I wouldn't know where to start with building a home lol hire someone. 

\---

Ex 3a)

When I then had him tell me how he would build a house that was nice, but not something he would live in, he basically crafted a house that took away the special features he likes (real fireplace for an electric, huge master bed for a standard, etc). He said ""if I can't live in it, then that means I would have to sell it. So I'd have to make it more cookie cutter because those sell.""

I'm wondering if my husband is actually displaying Te here in that he's trying to be as effective as possible through learning as much about the situation as possible? Not sure what I'm technically doing. 

In Ex 3, I'm wondering if he is searching for the Si details with his Te, but because he can't find them, he is using his Fi values? Am I misreading this? In Ex 3a, I'm seeing that he recognizes how his desires are diff than the masses and how to adjust them. I saw this as an Fi-Te axis thing. He didn't have much qualms about doing this/any sadness in doing this, so I would assume his Te is higher than Fi on the axis.

Recently, I got to know an ISFJ through a mutual friend. This ISFJ and I had been texting for some weeks. Circumstances at the time (said mutual friend's explicit ""matchmaking efforts"") led me to believe that this ISFJ was also interested in me. Hence, we started texting. 

Soon after, I asked her out on a date which I thought went really well. I reflected on it a lot and decided that I wanted to pursue her proper. We continued texting and I asked her out a second time. Only this time, silence. I went two days without a reply which was uncharacteristic of how she's been interacting with me prior to this. 

Then, our mutual friend suddenly informed me that I should give up pursuing the ISFJ because she's met someone else whom she has better chemistry with. 

In that moment, I experienced the ugliest concoction of feelings. Confusion, disappointment, indignation, anger. 

Given time, I can handle the rejection itself. It's part and parcel of the dating scene. But the *way* she rejected me, I take *great offense* to that because it violated several of my core values - honesty, decency, and clarity in communication. I pride myself on having a good bullshit radar so I felt like a massive fool when I was blindsided by her behaviour. 

Seeing how distraught I was, our mutual friend asked the ISFJ for her perspective on the matter and the ISFJ said that she thought she was just making a new friend in me and that she had no idea at all of the romantic context of our interactions.

I call bullshit on that.

It was explicit from the get go that we were introduced to each other as a matchmaking effort by our mutual friend. 

And then she flipped her excuse for ghosting me to ""I wanted to let her down gently"".

How in the fuck is ghosting someone a gentle way to let them down? First she lied, and then she came up with this cowardly, selfish, conflict-avoidant schpiel, thinking that I will buy it.  

She apologised in the end. BUT it wasn't directly to me. She apologised through our mutual friend. And that pissed me off even more because even after all that, she still didn't have the decency to interact directly with me. 

Typing all this out is getting me worked up again.

Anyway, we've stopped speaking to each other since. 

However, our mutual friend sometimes arranges group gatherings (for a larger group outside of us) and there is a chance I might run into the ISFJ in one of these gatherings. 

I'd be tempted to call her out on her behaviour if I see her but I want to hear how other ISTJs here have handled similar situations where someone crossed your values. I want to challenge myself to see things from her perspective (she ghosted me because she wanted to let me down gently i.e. she had good intentions) but it's *so difficult.*

How do you guys process your hurt and anger and how do you achieve an inner state of peace? Because as validated as I feel in my hurt, I also recognise that it isn't healthy in the long run. And I don't want to let this experience colour my decision to be vulnerable with new people when building relationships.",1559294362
ISTJ,"Out of curiosity, how often and how much time do you spend playing video games?

I had to delete my nhl game yesterday because I was spending way too much time in GM mode trying to plan for and optimize an expansion team (trying to create a team with avg age less than 23 that was competitive for the cup, and do it within 3 or 4 seasons of expansion).

Personally I find that I get sucked into games that I can turn into organizational challenges way too easily. Competition based games like rocket league are another go to, but don't suck me in for hours at a time, so I'm able to play them without losing my entire day.",1559262435
ISTJ,"Hey guys,

So I've always been a reserved person around new people and sometimes even friends. But now that I'm working full-time, I need to grow up and learn to talk to a variety of people. I care about making connections, but I'm pretty bad at it and I'm not very emotionally aware of myself and others. That's low Fi for you. I wouldn't care so much about learning how to better socialize if it wasn't affecting my career, but it is. I'm an engineer in a semiconductor company, and I have trouble getting along with people my age and people who are older than me. I don't find we have anything to relate to.

So how do other ISTJs interact with new people? What functions do you use? What do you talk about? What's your strategy? How do you keep a convo from becoming dry? This has definitely been giving me anxiety...",1559205230
ISTJ,"To quote my therapist. 

Hello,

I am scared of solitude turning into isolation. I am recently discovered as ISTJ and as time goes by, I am putting more and more value to my happy alone time. For a long time, I thought that something was wrong with me. I felt like I was totally different to other people. Social anxiety didn't help. I went to see a therapist and I was able to learn that I am fine, I do have an introverted character trait. 
I like people and there are times where I wished I had friends but the majority of the time, I am perfectly fine by myself. 
This above quote is something that struck me. My therapist told me that I should definitely try to make friends and go out with people my age, even for 20 minutes. Happy solitude today might turn into isolation later on. I've thus wanted to make friends and I even have now a penpal, although it that was me, I would prefer to stay by myself. I don't hate people, just to be clear. I am perfectly fine socializing in a working environment for example. But, I prefer to stay by myself. 

I am only 22 and in college. I would like to get to know the experience of people in their late 20s or 30s and above and I would like to know what does this quote means to you. Do you find it true that if I keep it to myself today, I might suffer years from now? Or do you find that you stayed happy by yourself even as time goes by?

Thanks for reading and have a nice day",1559197418

ISTJ,"Hi, I hope from this thread you can give me some opinions about a guy that Im currently in love with. I will try to give some details about it, so that you can have a clear picture about the situation that I'm  currently dealing with.

So, I am an ENFP gay men and I know this person for some months already. And today I have found out that he's really is an ISTJ (which I already guessed). The problem here is that I still not really sure whether he's  gay or not because it seems to me like he gave some mixed signals about it. I know this person from a really close female friend of mine who's working on the same company (different divison) with him. It turns out that he's actually a cousin of another friend of mine. So he told my female friend that he knows from his cousin that I'm gay and he's okay with that. 
At first we dont really have conversation at all cuz at first I'm not really sure about my attraction towards this person, altho we follow each other on Intsagram and I have his number from my friend. But three of us (me, him and my friend) do meet up sometimes. 
He drove to my city (I live in the big city while they live on smaller town nearby) on weekends. Until one day he decided to drive alone and stay at my place for the weekend. 
Since then our conversation become more intense from text messages, and many times it leads to past midnight, while like most ISTJ does, he have a really strict schedule and normally he goes to sleep around 8-9 PM. And he did drive to my place again the next weekend hes available.
During chats, as usual, I used to be the one that come up with topics (he does this sometimes, and most of the time its about something interesting happening in his work or family), and also the small talks in between (like what he ate or planning to), and somehow as an ISTJ he do respond and our conversation continues from that, altho he never (as I can remember) ask me back about those kinda 'small-talk' stuffs. Hes not really into traveling but he does support my plans (by saing okay, we will someday/later) when I said I hope we could go to this or that place someday.
Apart from that, he do always reply my messages everytime hes able to, even in beetween his busy work schedule.
Of all the things that we already talk about, I never bring up conversation about sexual or relationship, as I am afraid that he will start to distancing himself from me if he does know that I am right now have a feeling for him.  As I am also afraid that he's not responding  the way that I hope he would be, because somehow I am still enjoying the feeling that I have for him.
So last week we fly off to another city and spend the weekend together, and even after our endless conversation that passed the bed time and start early in the morning (without any sexual things involed), I'm still not sure whether he's gay or not (if he does, I know it without a doubt that he's also into me). 
Things that makes me doubt are, he was born and raised in a very traditional familiy and values, so even if he does gay, he might be still denying himself as it contradicting the tradition he grow up with. It seems to me that he never been in any romatic relationships before, so this kinda affection might be an alien for him cuz he never have something to compare to. He only have small number of male friends (most of them are female), so I do think of a possibility where he thinks that this kinda male-to-male endless conversation is normal. 

Thank you for reading this lengthy story of mine, I hope I could hear some thoughts from your perspective.

ISTJ,"Anyone who has ever seen me work has praised me for my organization and planning skills.  Yet I can't seem to apply that in my personal life unless I have something to structure my life around.  Anyone relate?

Right now, I'm between jobs.  I figured ""Cool, I'll actually have time to work on projects/go to the gym/read/etc.""  Nope.  Time has essentially ceased to have value so I can't even be bothered to keep track of it.  It's like I can't function unless I have something/someone to be accountable to.  My partner was having a rough couple of weeks at work and was putting in longer hours so I offered to make them dinner and run errands for them.  While I was prompted to offer as a gesture of support, I was more selfishly excited by the prospect of having a purpose and being able to structure my time around that.  Sure enough, this helped me build a routine.  Then my partner's hours went back to normal and I went back into ""schlub mode.""  

I'm currently experimenting with a ""point system"" where I have to earn a certain number of points per day and can do so by completing certain goals.  Too early to tell if it'll stick, but it's looking alright so far except I don't have any real incentives for meeting my daily goal or any penalty for not.

ISTJ,"I usually don't have anyone with me. While I prefer to have a companion on a joinery from point A to point B, the lack of one doesn't really bother anymore.

I'm perfectly comfortable handling myself and my luggage. While flying, I sometimes feel it is nice being a solo traveler since I don't have to wait for my partner to follow-up. Going through security is usually a breeze because I know and follow the rules. After that it's just the hassle of finding a lonely enough area where there are usually no kids and putting in headphones and whipping or a book.

On flights too, I make my suave as comfortable as possible pretty quickly and then either fiddle with my phone or watch a movie. Really never feel like conversing as traveling is tiresome in itself.

ISTJ,"INTJ here, I need some advice on how to mend a work relationship with an ISTJ.

Over a year ago, a manager assigned my ISTJ coworker to provide training for a position in the same department. Prior to this, my coworker and I had a very good relationship. We would often spend close to a half an hour after work just talking and enjoying each others company. Once tasked with this, my coworker would avoid scheduling any training or time to sit with me. She would provide only the most minimal of information and then criticize my lack of understanding of materials that had not been provided to me and of which I was not yet granted access to. I attribute this behavior primarily to the very poor relationship that she has with the manager that tasked her with training me and perhaps a worry that I could be an future replacement for her position. 

To summarize, management stepped in on their own accord to provide me training. There was some disciplinary action that was taken against her because of her refusal to follow the request of management and because of her behavior. They did not grant her the raise that she was expecting for that year. Since then, I have been promoted to the same position and am at the same level as her. She believes that it is my fault that she did not get the raise that she hoped for and refuses to work with or even talk to me despite the fact that we are the only 2 individuals within this department/team and this lack of communication is at the expense of the quality of the work that we do.

I have tried talking with her about this (a year ago) and she seemed to dismiss even the possibility that I was not intentionally trying to hurt her career, but the conversation did end with us agreeing to ""start over"". That does not seem to be what has happened. Instead, it seems that she has made efforts to make my job more challenging and to push her responsibilities onto myself. Unfortunately for the both of us, this has only resulted in me working that much harder and being recognized even more by management. I have only worked at this company for 3 years and she has been there for at least 15... I DONT want her position! It would be too much to take on for a single person. This is why management wanted to expand this department.

How do I get her to start seeing us a teammates instead of competitors? Or am I being hopelessly idealistic in thinking that this could ever improve?",1558655127

\-I would rather have fun than work

\-I feel as though I have lost sight of my goals

\-My tolerance for boredom has gone down significantly

\-I used to be a queen at avoiding drama, but now I have become a drama queen. I troll the fuck out of people, and I want in on all the latest gossip.

ISTJ,"Hii, reason I posted here was because this was one type I considered to be when looking into cognitive functions, if i posted in the wrong place or I'm not supposed to, please let me know. Anyways I will try to be as descriptive as possible, so I certainly do hope this doesn't go to waste. Anyways to introduce myself, I'm a 19 year old guy who seems to be your average dude (or at least I think so?). Everyone views me as Cool-headed, calm, hardworking and just behind the scenes. I'm also seen as mild-mannered and relaxed at all times, mostly because Its just who I am. I try my best to be honest and blunt about things, because genuinely I don't like beating around the bush with most things in life. Don't waste my time and I won't waste yours. I'm not as controlling as I used to be, but I still desire to be a clean person with everything in place. 

In terms of personal issues, I have plenty. I tend to be seen as incredibly no-nonsense and clean-cut when it comes to solving problems. I usually go out of my way to advise others on what to do, and if they don't listen, I can't help but to think what's on your mind that you aren't doing anything about it. I struggle with expressing my own emotions frequently, because I tend to try to focus on being logical above all else. But in the end I end up depressed and sulking over my own thoughts and feelings. 

In a way, I kinda think logically and far into the future, to the point of depressing myself. I always ask ""will this be here forever with the next 10+ years?"" ""Will I live long enough to see everything go well?"" ""Am I losing time in finding a purpose in life??"" These questions come into mind often. Not to mention I am not the most creative person there is...like at all. I find it a flaw to brainstorm multiple things and all of them being useless or not in depth. What I look for is depth and purpose in life. I don't like trying out new things that are unecessary. I don't really see the past as a big thing in my life at all. I see it as a lesson and if it was something good, a nice part of my life I can be proud of. But I'm always looking foward and ahead, because drowning in the past will only slow me down. Its easy for me to get over things, and I can sometimes not place an importance on small details.

I'll be honest, I sometimes do like hands-on work. Mostly because I'm in control of it and I know I am capable of getting things done. One of my biggest fears is not having enough experience and knowledge to continue my goals of being a Police Officer or being appointed in a position of authority. I dont have financial aid nor do I have much help or support. So I really I want to learn anything that involves my goals. I rarely ever deviate from anything useful or revelant to my interests. 

I'm not a materialistic person, I don't really value money, status, rank, or anything of the sort. I value simply having a purpose to life and finding out what I am meant for. I don't really care about society or people at all if I'm sincere. I mostly care about myself and those very close that I love. I think I'm an introvert because most of the time I genuinely don't like being around people and it can drain me. I especially hate being polite and having manners because it's all bullshit. I like things to be straightforward, not to have to pretend to be someone I dont like. 

If this helps, most people that come across in my life has always considered me a bit cruel when it comes to being blunt about things (even though I feel like I'm not blunt enough). My sibling thinks that certain characters that he sees in movies/games that relate to being calm and collected is me lol. My ex who I am close with now considers me to be someone who doesn't spare anyone's feelings, and can be short tempered when things don't go the way I want them to. I'm considered fair and kind-hearted, but cross me and I make no qualms about cutting you off from my life. I try not to let hatred become a motivation, but merely having common sense and being down to earth. 

I tend to notice I never feel anything genuine with people, or at least sympathize with anyone. Not sure if that has to do with anything. I don't really care about having a bunch of friends, I only care about having a close group of people, and beyond that are merely distant. Even though I'm super introspective and self-aware, I can't help but to feel conflicted with my personal feelings compared to what is logically the best thing for me and others. I assume that's normal for my age, but I feel the more I wait and do nothing, the less of a chance I have to do something significant. I want to have that drive that I will stop at nothing to accomplish w.e purpose or goal is in store for me. Everyone has a place in life, but I want to make sure I'm fulfilling mines and forging it myself. 

Good luck typing me ig. I just had a certain thought to it all, and I don't think I'm an INTJ, mostly because I feel like the stereotype kinda ruined my perception of it all. I don't enjoy being a smart-ass, because honestly I'm just someone with common sense and a rational mind, I'm not a genius. But the only types I've come to see a bit with me is ISTJ, ISFP, INTJ, ISTP, and the really improbable but still a possibility is INTP or INFJ. You guys determine that based on w.e proof you have. I'd just like to know why you believe it. Ask me things to clarify if you are unsure about what I meant on something.

MY PERSONAL OBSERVATION:
If there is one thing I struggle with knowing, is whether I'm a sensor or intuitive. I've had this struggle for a while because I value both. While I'm not very good at being creative or dreaming up completely different worlds, I am very interested at understanding subjects that are practical and can be impactful in my surroundings. I'm known for being physically clumsy at times, but I nevertheless am known for being on my feet and understanding what's going on around me and beyond the curtain. 

I struggle also with knowing whether I use Te or Ti because both seem to apply to what I use. I am not a controlling person at all, but I do like things to go according to how I want it. I definitely believe I'm a Fi user over Fe because Fi describes exactly how i feel on the inside, though I struggle with emotions in general. If I understood these functions a bit better, I might make a better observation, but I'm going with my guts with this.",1558017271

Both my boyfriends mother and ex-gf are ISTJs, and they both are‚Ä¶kinda weird‚Ä¶

We recently moved, and his mother is trying find out where we live in the weirdest ways. For example, ‚Äúlet me come over and bring you guys food‚Äù, or straight up just asking where we live. We know she‚Äôs not asking genuinely, because she has a history of showing up at our house, driving by to look and see what we‚Äôre doing through our windows or if we‚Äôre even there. Very unsettling. 

His ex-gf (short relationship like 3 months) has been frequently trying to add us on social media. She also drove by our new house to see what we were up to by looking through our windows (never stopped, just drove by, caught her doing it). We once were at a party, she was there, and she lingered near us just watching us‚Ä¶she even tried to attempt to talk to my boyfriend that night by saying something to him as we were walking away.

Whenever there is an interpersonal issue that needs resolving, they either ghost you, drag things out, or give unclear replies instead of doing the decent thing of addressing the problem head on so that you can have the appropriate information to decide on what to do next.

Their reasoning: They don't want to deliver bad news / don't want to hurt your feelings. 

On the surface, it seems like they have your interest at heart. But their reason for not wanting to address the issue at hand is a fucking selfish one - they don't want to feel your unhappiness. *It's their own feelings they're trying to protect, not yours.* They would rather prolong your hurt by leaving you in limbo than to straight up give you the information that you need.

They avoid avoid avoid and procrastinate, hoping that hell will eventually freeze over. They think that if they avoid the festering mess that they created, it'll go away on its own.

ISTJ,"For the confused this post is directed to my tech geeks.  If that isn‚Äôt you that‚Äôs fine.

Sensor as a Service (SaaS) and Intuition as a Service (NaaS) could be viewed as analogous to relational vs non-relational databases.  Both are useful but operate in very different ways. 

SaaS would be relational.  The excel spreadsheet type.  Defined fields, defined columns, defined rows.  Neat, functional, easily queried.

NaaS would be non-relational.  Takes any kind of data whether parameters exist or not.  Less focusing on parsing, higher focus on through put and where the data should go.

In practice this isn‚Äôt a perfect analogy but I use this because it helps me better define in a small way how sensor works vs my iNtuition.  Both has to process data but how when and why make a big difference on how it‚Äôs done.  

In this way, the person using NaaS is less concerned about a category, description, or other that neatly fits in a column.  It‚Äôs more like a json data dump.  The info is there, we know it, but the context is built in so to speak.  We can have mixed data in same information brackets.  We don‚Äôt necessarily need to understand the entire contents of the data but rather ensure the right format for whoever is going to use it.

Wait did I just say intuitives will tell people things that the intuitive themselves don‚Äôt really understand?  Yes and it happens all the time.  Accuracy of data isn‚Äôt a central focus of NaaS.  Rather it‚Äôs contextual based on the type of data.  In practice a NaaS user may use incorrect description fields from the data dump but at the same time give accurate information on context.  Example:  ‚ÄúThe dove is flying‚Äù.  The NaaS user incorrectly identifies the bird type but based on context is referring to bird.  In practice it makes us look foolish.  Like we don‚Äôt understand what we are talking about.  While true in some cases it‚Äôs important to remember that the NaaS user is designed to work under a far less categorized filing system.  This is also what drives the creativity we tend to show.  We can mix and match data that doesn‚Äôt seem to correlate in a more generalized way.  

If you‚Äôre scratching your head and wondering how the fuck do we even function, you aren‚Äôt alone.  I have times I‚Äôll ask myself ‚Äúhow am I even alive‚Äù.  But it works.  And it also explains why we tend to look like idiots to sensors.  We are working with a completely different storage and access management software type.",1557325457

ISTJ,"Tl;dr I need help figuring out how to approach my ISTJ boyfriend about serious relationship issues.

This was inspired by another post in which a fellow redditor suggested having a relationship check-in discussion. I (INFP) really need to approach my ISTJ boyfriend with some issues and want the talk to be as effective as possible. I would appreciate any feedback or suggestions as this talk needs to happen soon. 

A little background: I (45f) have been with my boyfriend (38m) for 3.5 years. I was married for 18 years and had a few ‚Äúserious‚Äù relationships after my divorce before meeting him. This is his first serious relationship (which I saw as a red flag initially, but he was able to explain it.). Before me, he spent many years ‚Äúin his shell‚Äù. Then he was completely focused on making money in his unconventional career. Then he was moving around a lot and didn‚Äôt want to get involved in a relationship when he knew he would be moving. Anyway, he doesn‚Äôt seem to be lacking in relationship skills. He was raised in what seems to be a functional, normal family. 

Our issues: I have a career (teacher) and make decent money but have kids and have always lived paycheck to paycheck. He has money (from previous ventures) but hasn‚Äôt worked in 5+ years. I don‚Äôt know how much money he has, but it seems as though he is financially well-off. I try not to pry because we do not share finances. He moved in with me. We should have discussed it in more detail, but we settled on him paying me slightly less than half of my rent each month. I assumed he would help with other things, such as food. He used to give me money for groceries, but that has stopped. My life has improved financially since he‚Äôs lived with us, but I find that I resent the fact that I cook seven nights a week now and my grocery bill has gone up quite a bit since he moved in. It‚Äôs hard for me to ask him for money because it feels like I‚Äôm being greedy since I don‚Äôt necessarily NEED it. 

Next issue: he stays up all night and sleeps most of the day. Okay, cool. It bothers me a little bit, especially on weekends when I‚Äôm home and can‚Äôt make noise until after he gets up at noon, but whatever. What bothers me most is that he no longer helps me out much at all around the house. When we lived apart, he would often keep his house clean and would always do the dishes if I cooked. This doesn‚Äôt happen now that we live together. In fact, I often come home after working all day and do his dishes, while he sits on the couch watching sports. He often reminds of the things I need to do (vacuum, wash the dog) rather than do them himself. I feel like I have gained another child rather than a partner. 

So here‚Äôs my plan for the discussion: I was thinking of giving him advance notice of the talk ‚ÄúHey, I was thinking we could sit down tomorrow night and discuss a few things, evaluate how the relationship is going, etc.‚Äù I don‚Äôt really want to spring it on him. However, when I‚Äôve done that in the past, he has wanted to discuss things immediately. What do you think? Should I just be ready with a list? 

How do ISTJ‚Äôs react to ‚Äúrules‚Äù being in place for things like discussions? Whenever we have discussed things before, he has never heard me out completely. He always interrupts me and then turns it back on me and won‚Äôt let me talk until I agree that whatever the issue is, it is my fault. I would like to have a rule that the other person can‚Äôt talk until the speaking person is done. 

How should I handle emotions? I tend to cry when I‚Äôm having a serious discussion, and I worry that he won‚Äôt take me seriously. ‚ÄúOh, there goes athenalv again, being all weak and emotional. Maybe it‚Äôs that time of the month. I‚Äôm sure she doesn‚Äôt mean what she is saying.‚Äù Would it better if I can somehow keep them bottled up? 

I need him to know that our relationship is really on the line and that I‚Äôm starting to resent it and him. We have to fix this soon, or it will end, and I don‚Äôt think that is what I want. I just need him to make some changes (and tell me what changes I need to make as well). I don‚Äôt want to end up talking in circles and accomplishing nothing. All of our other serious talks have ended with me agreeing that he‚Äôs right, not getting my point across, and shouldering all the responsibility for the issues in our relationship. 

So, ISTJ‚Äôs, how would you like to be approached with issues such as the ones I need to raise? I want to really accomplish something with this talk. I want it to strike a chord with him.",1556858642

ISTJ,"After years of ignoring MBTI and 'personality type' theories and things like that I finally decided to do some reading on it. I knew that I was fairly introverted and not great at expressing emotion - and just got on with life... I am a change management professional at a large corporate with a small number of direct reports, so not dissatisfied at all career wise and I've always had a good (but small) group of close friends. 

Firstly I'm kicking myself for not reading up on MBTI earlier as it's scarily accurate and a real lightbulb moment. 

If I'm being honest ISTJ rings the most true. Obviously there's never a perfect fit and I can empathise with elements of INTJ and ISTP perhaps but I just keep coming back to ISTJ. Although I _thought/think_ I am relatively good at reading people's reactions to things and not being the blunt/rude stereotype that seems to exist, I can't deny it is extremely accurate in many ways.

Anyway, upon finding their type, was anyone slightly depressed at how grim the outlook is for ISTJs from a relationship perspective? Not that it's a huge shock - I mean all the writeups saying 'you've probably not had a huge amount of romantic relationships', 'you're not great at expressing emotion or picking up on partner's emotional needs' is something I sensed anyway.

I guess it's having it confirmed in writing and that it's effectively hard wired in to you that's depressing me. I got out of a six year relationship about a year ago and am just starting to explore again. 

It kind of feels like ISTJs sure once they get _in_ a relationship are extremely committed and dutiful and provide great support, we're not exactly appealing to most other types at the outset. I.e. fairly reserved, not great at flirting, small talk and playful physical contact. 

I like to think I'm very easy to converse with, engaged and attentive - but I know it probably still comes off slightly 'stiff'.

ISTJ,"(He is either ISTJ or INFP so I'll post this on both)

We were in a relationship and things were great. Then, he had to go on a trip for three months. So far, we have been apart for two months.

**The problem:**

We have been growing apart and feeling distant. He expressed a desire to end our relationship because of this. However, he keeps saying things like **""There are a lot of things I like about us- I am really attracted to you, we have fun together, \[he listed all the great things\]. But for some reason... something has been missing, we somehow seem to be lacking a close connection, and are growing apart instead of growing closer. So I don't think we are a good fit together.""**

This is completely strange to me because he seems to be attributing us growing apart to a problem with our relationship. Why is it so confusing and unexpected that we are distant? It's obvious that it is 100% due to us being apart for two months.

If he just said ""look we have a great relationship but the long distance is too much for me to handle"" that would be different. But he isn't attributing this to the long distance. He is saying we aren't a good fit in the first place.

In my mind, I see it as something special got ruined due to distance. And that's a sad thing. But he doesn't feel sad because he doesn't see it as something great being ruined. He thinks it wasn't great in the first place because he is blaming the current problem on our relationship instead of the distance.

It just seems really unfair for him to attribute this 'growing apart' to us not having a good relationship. Our relationship is perfectly fine, this only happened because of being apart.",1556465581

This is about when we do socialize.  She wants to talk to me about the things she is working on and how her efforts are going.  I‚Äôm realizing this is her way of telling me what‚Äôs important to her and letting me in on that.  I used to see it as inundating me with mundane details because I did not understand why she felt all these things were important.  Thing about the INFP is that it‚Äôs the person and their internal feelings that are important, not details and planning of things.  I now realize this is her way of interpreting that.  So instead of thinking of it as mundane details I now think of it as her expressing how she is feeling.  Accordingly instead of shifting the conversation away I simply let her guide it.

As a result I‚Äôm beginning to understand her language patterns that denote her mood.  This is highly relevant to me because again, INFP.  In turn she has made efforts to understand my verbosity at times.  I would imagine it‚Äôs just as weird to her as her communication style is to me.  I mentioned it previously but it is having an effect on my direct communication skills.  Definitely a bonus.

We still have hiccups.  I‚Äôll get a few steps ahead in my head and she isn‚Äôt on the same page and we can‚Äôt figure each other out.  I stop, tell her ‚Äúhang on, let me reprocess this‚Äù and she realizes too so she gives me a minute.  This resets the conversation and almost instantly clears up any confusion.  I also find that we think very much alike, just go about it differently.  It‚Äôs solving for that difference is what makes all the difference.

ISTJ,"Hi, I‚Äôm an Entp f. I was in a very serious relationship with an ISTJ m for two years, about 4 year ago. We‚Äôve stayed in touch over the years, and he‚Äôs always wanted to get back together. He thought that we were soulmates and intended for us to grow old together. We broke up because I felt that we were too inherently compatible at the age of 19, and I needed time to find and work on myself before being in a relationship. I had very low self esteem, and thought he deserved better. After all this time, we‚Äôve gone on trips and dates on and off. He‚Äôs been there for me during rough patches when I ended up in two other toxic relationships. I realize that he‚Äôs the best thing I‚Äôve ever had, and that maybe we really are soulmates. I needed that time to understand myself and resolve my inner conflicts. Recently, we spent the night together after all this time had passed. We‚Äôd been going out on late night drives and mini dates for the past few months. All was going well, until we had sex. He said he felt embarrassed that he finished so quickly, and maybe I pushed too hard to talk about work related things when he wasn‚Äôt in the mood for it but was instead looking for peace and relaxation. Right after sex, he said he couldn‚Äôt stay the night because he hasnt been able to sleep and abruptly left. That triggered me emotionally, as he‚Äôs never been the type of guy to have sex with me and leave. I called him out on it, and he left the house. After years of calling me and pursuing me to get back together, he‚Äôs been ignoring all of my texts and calls for the past week. I‚Äôm so confused. We both were looking for this reconnection to happen when we were both ready, and now he‚Äôs not talking to me. He also said that work has been extremely stressful for him, and me bringing up his other ambitions might have stressed him out. He also said that he has been very in his head and hearing voices recently (?), and that he wants to see a therapist because he hasn‚Äôt been himself. A long time ago (when we first started dating), he told me that if he ‚Äúever became a monster, go far away from me‚Äù.

I‚Äôm an ENFJ and I‚Äôve become really fond of you guys over recent years. My 61 year old dad is an ISTJ and earlier tonight, his mum (my grandma) passed away, at the age of 94. It wasn‚Äôt unexpected by any means, but they were very close, so I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs really hitting him hard. 

I‚Äôm wondering what you suggest I do to help him. He‚Äôs notoriously good at just keeping on and doing things no matter the circumstances, but I want to make sure he has space to grieve and feels supported by me and my mum. He‚Äôs not very good at asking for help and generally just does things himself. He also has a massive week planned with things he can‚Äôt (and doesn‚Äôt want to) get out of, so I imagine it will be a difficult week for him mentally and emotionally. 

So far, my mum and I have offered to organise everything for the funeral and wake so that all he has to do is deal with the legal documents and solicitor. Is there anything else you can think of that would support him while he grieves? How can I help him?",1555938837

ISTJ,"Apparently I am now an ISTJ. In the past I scored INTJ. Terrible incurable tragedies have happened to me since INTJ days  and my personality and life has changed greatly. 

What surprised me about getting ISTJ on the myers briggs was (1) i am not detail oriented i'm more of a big picture person. i get frustrated when people dwell on details and dont complete the larger task at hand and also i simply dont have the memory or cognitive capacity to remember details (2) i often break rules in the workplace because i find them to be counterproductive, pointless, stupid, illogical, etc etc etc. my job has tons of idiotic rules that make life more difficult and less productive. 

An example of #2. I was called to jury duty and i filled out the survey. one question said 'would you say someone was guilty if you disagreed with the law'. i answered 'no' since if i disagree with the law then i wont say someone is guilty. i am strict about rules but they have to be rules that i believe in and support. if i dont like a rule im not the sort who will stick to it simply because its a rule. a rule at my job is no gloves while at the cash register. i often break this rule and have been called out by higher ups about it so i try to be more sneaky now. i refuse to follow such a stupid rule like not wearing gloves. its disgusting and unhygienic &amp; dangerous for me since i have autoimmune disease. i dont care if it looks ""bad"" to customers since i should come first considering the situation. 

i greatly identify with ISTJ people like ned stark and stannis baratheon in GoT. i always get taken advantage of. i seriously detest and loathe people in a general sense. i think people become ISTJ because they have nothing else to offer. they are born untalented and worthless and so they must compensate by being gritty and hardworking. every ISTJ that pops up seems weak or destined to failure..i really hate that. i am eager about not being an ISTJ / person who is taken advantage of in the future. i also loathe and detest sweet talkers.

ISTJ,"You see the same posts here every other day:

*‚ÄúI‚Äôm OBSESSED with an ISTJ and I NEED to know if they like me based on X, Y, and Z scenarios.‚Äù*

After seeing this so often I started to try and piece together why this is exactly. I know analyzing oneself isn‚Äôt always easy, so perhaps this is more for the people who come with these ISTJ questions.

I think the quiet stoicism is something that‚Äôs attractive to many people, primarily for the following:

1.) mystery. We all like something we can‚Äôt quite understand.

2.) a mental ‚Äúvacation.‚Äù I know as an INFJ I‚Äôm picking up on everyone‚Äôs psychic garbage all day, it‚Äôs nice to speak to ISTJs because they aren‚Äôt putting baggage out into the world.

3.) what I call the ‚Äúcat effect.‚Äù The cat effect is seen in that one cat who hates everyone (maybe not even hate, but indifference). They won‚Äôt give you affection or love or even the occasional meow. When that cat shows you any sort of love, it‚Äôs very special. It‚Äôs even more special when they give *you and solely you* that love.

Maybe this is something we all know, but on every single one of these posts people become ‚Äúobsessive‚Äù about the ISTJ, because *they can‚Äôt read them.* Sure they might be straightforward, but I‚Äôve seen several posts on this subreddit that also say *‚ÄúI just stare at someone I like and never speak to them.‚Äù* This creates a pathway for people to obsess. Whereas many types you could say *‚Äúoh they haven‚Äôt initiated much of anything, they‚Äôre professional, and they‚Äôre stoic - chances are they don‚Äôt have any interest.‚Äù* Contrastingly, those aware of MBTI know ISTJs might not show it actively, which leaves the door open.

Open metaphorical relationship door +  lack of communication between both parties = obsessing over an ISTJ.

ISTJ,"Hi guys,
can you please give me relationship advice or clarification? hehe. This is too long but please be patient in reading (you can also skip some part if you want). Hope you could help me with this. Thank you very much for you reply. :)
I am the quiet and shy-type ESFJ (sometimes ISFJ), who has an ISTJ colleague and church mate. We met in December 2018 as I am a new hire in the Company he is also in. He is so quiet, kind and gentle so I didn't have any hard time approaching him. Then now, I realized that I am starting to like him but I do not know if he feels the same way towards me. I know, we only knew each other for two months and I don't want to rush things. But it makes me crazy if he has a thing for me or not. I've been hurt before and thought that my crush felt the same thing that I feel but I was wrong. So now, I don't want to jump into any conclusion if he won't say that he has feelings for me.
Looking back, it all started when he connected me to his internet to find my way home. We are in a group and he offered me to connect with his net so I won't get lost. We constantly see each other as we have bible study and church service both once per week. During those times, there were moments when he's discussing and when I look him straight to the eyes, he looks down and look at me again. Having no sense of direction, I use to asked him if I can go with him and he says yes all the time that I ask him so we started to knew that we both like dogs and nature. After some time, there was one moment when he was discussing but his just looking straight to my eyes while smiling, that went for how many seconds (note I was also looking into his eyes and they're beautiful. hehe). Also, one moment I accidentally leaned on his shoulders because of my shyness, he didn't move away, He only looked as if he lost his strength when I did that to him. After that, he said that he will drop me to my home several times. When I go with him, I tried to offer paying for the fare but he's not allowing me.
Another action that made me think includes:(1) we both attended a colleague's birthday dinner. We came late together with 3 colleagues and when I got there. He called my name and waived just at me. After the dinner, he initiated the conversation, are you going to watch with them? I said yes. then he started to open our activity related to nature that he organized. He didn't remove his eyes on me the whole time that he was talking. I did the same thing to show that I am interested to him. He said that it's his first time to do that and that he is excited and other stuff. I said that I will prepare food but he said that we can buy if it will be a hassle for me. He's also asking me if there is a place that I want to go to. I said none and asked him in return if he has. He said none as well and we kept on talking while going home. The next day, out of nowhere, he's saying that he wants to buy ring and will propose. I am not sure if he is seeing anyone but according to his the people close to him. He's not seeing anyone. The looking into each other's eye went on every bible study as he usually sit across me. (2) In work, I always ask him work related questions and he always answers me. Also, there was one moment where he plotted in excel so I could get what he is explaining. I think this made me like him even more. (3) One moment, I said that I like theme parks and I'm into extreme rides. He started to tell his experience and said that he's trying. We even stopped near my place to continue his story and before saying goodbye, he said that he will tell me if there's a sale. (3) we were teammates for 2 weeks (the best days of my work), we talked a lot of things, God, Family, testimonies, animals, and random stuff. I actually initiated the conversation, I opened myself up then ask him questions. He told me his plan and said not to tell anyone about it. He's so gentle to me and looks happy with our conversation. He even told stories and showed his pictures of the countries he already visited. One time, he paid for my juice and said that its just a small amount. So the next day, I also ask him what he want and I will pay for it. He smiled but said that he doesn't want anything. He looked so happy at that time. We usually tell stories when going to and from the client. He's really participating and one time when we pass a theme park. He pointed it to me and said that it's beautiful there. I asked him if what places he visited here. He said that he's not going out that much before. I am a bit surprised of how much he loves to go out now. (3) I wasn't feeling so well so one time so I closed my eyes for a few minutes. He asked me if I'm okay but he's a bit panicking. I said my head hurts then he started to get all his medicines and asking me if I want. While going home, I was so quiet so he initiated the conversation but I can't respond so well so he said that I should sleep. After some time I opened my eyes and saw him looking at me. Then he started to say that he's checking if I am sleeping with startled reaction. Don't know why he's startled but he's very cute at that time. In the CG that day, I only embraced the cat and didn't participate in any conversation then he came and showed me pictures of cats which I like. he gave his phone then he left me. After that, he came to me again and brought me food then goes away again. He's panicking and looked worried at that time. (4) there were instances where he's always talking to the person beside me but he's not talking to me. Once, I got scratch from the cat and while he's talking to the person beside me. He asked me, did you get wounds? I said no, just a scratch. We've been chatting constantly, but I always initiate it. there are time when hes so slow in responding and now he's a bit okay. (5) After the two weeks and I will be assigned in a far away place, he said that I will be missed. To show that, I am into him. I thanked him and said that that being with him was the best days of my work even though the client is stressful. I didn't know that we'll meet that night in a church activity. Our churchmates, including me and him, had a coffee after. He's suggesting drinks to me and suggested the drinks that I like. When the drinks came he's asking me if the drink was okay for me. He also, opens doors and sometimes car doors for me. Sometimes he even closed it for me. (5) there are times during the 2-weeks where we discussed work looking into each other' eyes. He don't looked in other direction for minutes just looking at me. Our hands touches during those moments. and one time he I felt his shoulder touched mine while showing me how to navigate our tool using my laptop. (6) I invited him to taking pictures of nature, since he's a great photographer. I am the model, so he took shots of me and said that he will send it to me. He also taught me how to take pictures. When I was holding his camera and trying to click. he placed his hands in mine and taught me the right way of clicking. He already sent the pictures to me and said that hopefully there's a beautiful shot. I asked him, if he enjoyed and he said yes. He asked me in return, I said I was very happy. and to my surprise he said that we should always do that. We used to chat but it happens when I initiate it. I said good night to him and he reciprocates it. I am not sure If I am bothering him with this. I used to follow what he says and take extra caution in what he likes and show him that I am listening to him so I know the food that he likes. :) (4) he got sick so I sent him his likes (dogs and prayer) he said sorry for late reply. I told him to get well and ask him to take medicine and don't get stress and relax. I showed him how concerned I am in the chatbox. It seemed that he's responding to me and said that he's taking meds. He also told me to relax and hoped that my client is not stressful.Last week, we're chatmates for the whole week due to our Friday event. But last Friday, He instructed me to take a picture of me and another guy. (because we are three colleagues there). While in the platform, he told me to take care since I am bit dizzy. I am touchy, so talk to him closely and touch his elbows, shoulders at times. Got no reaction that he doesn't want anyway.
Guys, do you think he likes me, or just he's just being kind and view me as a little sister? Do you think he knows that I like him? How can I make him feel that I like him?

ISTJ,"Just a heads up, this is likely to be a long post. Also, I apologize for any grammar, formatting or spelling errors, I'm on my phone at the moment. A very long story short, boyfriend lost his mom about 1.5 years ago, his sister 4 months ago, and his dad -might- have some kind of throat cancer. Big emphasis on the 'might'; and I could use some suggestions on helping him handle this.


With that out of the way, here's the long version, with some back story. He and I have been together for about 4.5 years now. About a year and a half ago his mom passed away very suddenly. We live across the street from his parents, so we were there, and I tried to resuscitate her for a good 20 minutes before paramedics arrived, which he unfortunately saw. I tried to keep him from watching them work on her.

 The whole experience was truly awful for him. He had lived a fairly sheltered life, both parents together, grew up in the same house, never witnessed anything or experienced anything too terribly traumatic, other than one incident when he was about 10. He was also EXTREMELY close with his mom. His dad was hospitalized for a suspected heart attack the day after (ended up just being stress mostly), and wasnt released until the morning of the service.

Anyways, a little over a year later, one of his sisters, who had struggled with alcohol and drugs, used the whole thing as a reason to really go off the deep end. We all tried to help her. She ended up passing away just this last December. Then, just a couple months after, in February, my mom was diagnosed with a very aggressive brain cancer, had brain surgery and all that, and he has seemed to be struggling a bit with it (he kind of sees my mom as a second mom in a way, especially after his mom passed.) We have talked a lot about it and he has told me that overall he is handling it well, but it is difficult at times. 

And now, his dad is going to be having a biopsy of a spot the doctors found on his throat, that plus his general symptoms almost perfectly match throat cancer. Of course this is all incredibly preliminary, he could just have irritation in his throat and be perfectly fine, and I've done my best to get him thinking about that instead of the alternative. He is taking it all really hard. The stress from the last, well, there's been more than this going on with family health as well, so for the last 3 or 4 years, and the high stress of the last few months especially are really getting to him. 

ISTJs, what helps you in times of high stress or crisis?

In doing so I am having to be even more honest with myself on how I feel and what I want to say as well as how I should say it.  

For the first time there is a real sense of warmth and reciprocation happening.  She is seeing the effort I‚Äôm putting in and is responding more cordially and ‚Äúwarm‚Äù from my perspective.  It‚Äôs not perfect, I still allow for mistranslation issues but it is far superior to what we had before.

She is beginning to use a little positive reinforcement that I naturally relate to which is immensely appreciated.

ISTJ,"I feel like I should preface this by saying my boyfriend thinks he‚Äôs an INTJ, but he also hasn‚Äôt read into type theory, doesn‚Äôt know anything about jungian cognitive functions, and thinks mbti is the astrology of the psych world (he has a PhD in developmental psychology). 

We‚Äôve been together for ~2.5yrs and best friends that entire time (plus a bit before). We‚Äôve lived together for nearly 2 years. Lately he seems to be increasingly more distant and irritated by me. I can‚Äôt ask if something is wrong or check in with the relationship because that just makes him more irritable and doesn‚Äôt provide any answers. We are normally a very jokey couple but we keep going through these bouts of disinterest or something where what usually makes him laugh just results in his indifference/cold demeanor, and the bouts seem to be increasingly longer + more frequent. I feel like he holds disdain for me during these times. I should mention that he would never be verbally or physically abusive and doesn‚Äôt seem to do this with malevolent intent. 

I used to think maybe he just maxes out on socialization or compassion or something so I give him his space, but now I‚Äôm starting to think that he‚Äôs getting sick of this relationship. He‚Äôs not all that in tune with his emotions, hates thinking about/discussing them, so it makes it difficult to troubleshoot. 

I also know, however, that even when he IS aware of something that bothers him, he does not vocalize it and instead stews and builds resentment. This is driving me insane and I don‚Äôt know how to proceed - any advice?",1555003348

ISTJ,"fairly new relationship. for the first 2 months he didnt want to be apart from me. quality time is his love language. his enthusiasm, texts and phone calls got more distant and infrequent since 2 days ago. i think he might be stressed from other things but i cant help but take it personally... maybe he is losing interest? is this indicative of anything? how do i go about supporting my partner without seeming too imvasive or overbearing?",1554909906
ISTJ,"So many of the ISTJ posts here are not directly relevant to ISTJ functions: so I‚Äôd like to take the time to apologize in advance, and thank all of you for consistently answering the questions we have.

Short story: my boss is an ISTJ, I am an INTJ. We have a significant age difference, and we have both established (recently) that we are attracted to one another. I spent the night with him (nothing sexual, but we did touch) a week or so back, and I came over to do it again, and we had the reality check conversation.

In summation: his reputation. Dating someone younger than you (*especially* an employee) can make the older party be perceived as creepy or manipulative. Given this, he told me we can‚Äôt move forward. 

Here‚Äôs where it starts to get confusing: I agreed with him on every point. I would like to one day pursue a relationship with him, though not now (I haven‚Äôt expressed this though, he‚Äôs really independent and I don‚Äôt want him to feel pressured). But I asked if we could continue as we have been (hanging out after work, occasionally going to each other‚Äôs homes and drinking, playing card games, etc), and he said ‚Äúwell I wouldn‚Äôt want you to do that if you were in a relationship.‚Äù So I told him ‚Äúif your concern is with your image, then wouldn‚Äôt it benefit you for me to be in a relationship?‚Äù At this point he just sort of stared off, and said ‚Äúprobably.‚Äù

Then he texted me saying he was thinking about other solutions to our situation, but he hadn‚Äôt come up with anything. Whereas I thought his solution was simply not dating.

Here are some additional facts if they help:
We‚Äôve been ‚Äúflirting‚Äù for 6-7 months now (I say flirting in parenthesis because we are both extremely shy. Mostly I just notice him staring at me and sarcastically poking fun at me often). We have stayed after work many times until 3-5am just talking. He‚Äôs opened up about a lot of personal things, some of which he‚Äôs expressed he‚Äôd never told anyone. He said at one point I was so smart that if he‚Äôd met me 15 years ago he would‚Äôve run and hid. He has never dated anyone before.

Again, I‚Äôm looking for clarity here because I don‚Äôt want him to feel smothered. He said he‚Äôs never dated because his independence is his number one priority. I have a lot of respect for that and I don‚Äôt want to threaten it. Thank you!",1554865585
ISTJ,"3 days ago I made [this thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/ISTJ/comments/baal6w/infp_here_have_3_questions_for_you/) as a culmination of research about the ISTJ.  This research began as a desire to better relate to my wife.

I am now communicating directly about what I want if I want something.  I‚Äôm now actively listening to what she says regardless of whether I find the topic interesting.  I‚Äôm doing my best to format my answers in the least frustrating way possible for her.  It‚Äôs helping.

What I‚Äôm getting confused on now is when I directly state something I expect to be done, she quickly wants to squash the subject.  She will use the excuse that we will talk later because she is busy with something.  Understandable since she is busy but that doesn‚Äôt stop her when it‚Äôs a subject she wants to talk about.

ISTJ,"So, I have been in a relationship for nine years with an ISTJ. We have been married for seven of those years. At first, things were amazing. She is beautiful and highly intelligent and could converse about anything and everything. She was (and still is) quiet and shy sometimes, but it has been great to watch her grow and follow me on adventures (yeah, that sounds weird to say ""follow,"" but she isn't very spontaneous, so I make the plans, typically).


However, the last year and a half things have gotten rocky. To the point where if we're home together, an entire evening can pass in uncomfortable silence. She considers watching TV or playing video games to be complete time-wasters, so I can't even get her to sit on the couch with me and join in either activity. We'll make and eat dinner together, clean up, then go to our separate corners. She typically sits on the laptop and reads... stuff, or does the same with her phone. 


It is almost as if we need outside, or third-party, interaction to do anything together anymore. However, if we go to dinner, we'll say a few words during the meal, but pass mostly in silence. If we go to a family member's home for an event, she is typically off in a corner with her phone. So much so that family members have been recently commenting, ""Is she okay? Everything alright?""  And I don't rightly know.


A few weeks ago, we were supposed to go on a group trip with friends. At the last minute, she told me she didn't want to go (ended up being for the best as another family member had a major surgery that week). 


So, ISTJs... I need some insight.  What am I doing wrong?",1554670849

ISTJ,"Folks, I‚Äôve nowhere else to go seeking for this advice. I‚Äôm reaching out to you all ISTJs here for help! I‚Äôm an ENFP female (I tested as ENFJ too) head over heels on my ISTJ male superior at work. I love the way he is calm and composed, pleasant, approachable, smiling and very knowledgeable. He speaks his guards off only with a handful of people, else one won‚Äôt even get a ‚Äúgood morning‚Äù back. He loves to spend time by and with himself and his phone during breaks and in his commute to work. 

I joined him 9 months ago and I‚Äôm sure that I‚Äôve impressed him at work coz he gave me a couple of awards for good work. Never appreciated verbally himself but he spends at least an hour a month just with me to discuss work (and that will be full of laughter). I always joke around him in a group and he equally pulls my leg and have a lot of fun teasing me. I make fun of his choice of shirts and he takes them all with a smile. I don‚Äôt know if he does these things only with me coz I usually don‚Äôt see him talking to many women in this way. When I asked him if he was an ISTJ, he said yes and said explicitly that he likes to spend time alone given a chance than talk to people. 

Fun part. The last 9 months, we have had hundreds of eye contacts. A lot of passing looks, one time we looked at each other sitting in front of each other in a meeting room along with other people for continuously 4 seconds without batting eye lids until someone in the room spoke to break it and once we made 4 eye contacts within 1 minute across where we were standing when we both were busy talking to someone else beside us. I used to use office messenger to chat with him sometimes and our conversations are usually short. He tends to ask for my opinions (like, what do u have in mind to plan this?) and usually does what I said, he may just be reassuring himself. 

I‚Äôve never hinted my feelings apart from those intentional eye contacts - I‚Äôve been caught red handed looking at him many times and I‚Äôve caught him looking thrice or so. I finally mustered some courage to text him two days ago to remind him of a video shoot and told him to wear something nice. He texted for 20 mins though they were short responses. The next day he wore something and asked me ‚Äúdoes this work for u?‚Äù. I was pleasantly surprised. We had a lot of fun shooting that video, just the two of us. And sometimes, when we get some 1-1 accidentally in the building somewhere, he will always keep browsing his phone while he is talking to me. I feel disrespected but I let it go. 

Just when I was feeling accomplished that I‚Äôve got him to take me into his fort, I encountered this yesterday evening. I was standing by the elevator to go down and grab lunch, he also appeared to come out of the door and join the elevator but he scooted back into the office before even he opened the door. I‚Äôm sure he saw me standing near the elevator. It felt as if he avoided that 1-1 time completely with me and I felt shattered by it, it hurt my ego a lot as to what mistake did I do now, that he didn‚Äôt want to share elevator with me. 

This hurt me guys. I‚Äôve spent so much time in getting him comfortable with me. I‚Äôve never encroached his space - Though I take the same train as him, I would be so careful, I don‚Äôt even go near him in the train respecting his space. I don‚Äôt know why I would deserve this ‚Äúsorry-I-cant-spend-time-with-you‚Äù. Now that I‚Äôve feelings for him, it is hard. How can I deal with this from here on? Please give me your advice!

* Organize my desk and backpack, but not very detail oriented.
* Can work on my car, but don't enjoy it.

ISTJ,"Hello all, this is a 2-3 mo relationship. I appreciate many things about his personality and he's quite attractive (which he refuses to believe when I tell him!!). However, I feel that I'm not really visible to him a lot of the time. When he talks, he likes to tell me about events at work, and people from work, and things like that and I feel like an audience. It doesn't feel like a conversation. I can't participate other than nod or make a small comment. With other people, it doesn't go that way. Conversation is more interactive, we talk about things, ideas, books, things we've learned, events, people. I can't seem to ever get a diverse conversation with him. Is it an ISTJ thing? Anyone partnering with an ISTJ noticed the same? How I can I address it? I don't want to be critical - I just want to feel visible and this makes me feel invisible and quite bored.

I've read stuff online and seems like ISTJs are very regularly seen as insensitive/ pessimistic/ cold and with the one ISTJ I know, I find it hard to comprehend. After some thinking I realise she may actually seem that way to many other people.

This ISTJ and I entered the same middle school (this sch is part of the top 10% of the nation academically) and within the first week I've already heard things about this ISTJ, my newfound friends told me that this ISTJ was really unlikeable and mean and all. Many people hated her. Me being the kind of person to refuse to build a solid impression of a person without interacting with them myself, of course I went and found that ISTJ to see how they were like. (also bc I heard she was considering joining the same club as me)

I introduced myself to her and said I was considering the same club (which was a sports club) and the first thing she told me was smt along the lines of me looking 'overweight and whether I was sure I could cope with the physical training there' and my reply was just a shrug and 'i can try' 

Three years later when we somehow talked about this conversation again, she told me that that conversation was a big reason she ended up becoming best friends with me. She said it was nice that someone actually didn't get offended by what she said (she continued being very direct even after that conversation) , and actually taking her advice to improve.

I'm just that kind of person who'll accept any comment hurled at me as long as it's the truth/ it makes sense. The only time I'll get offended is when I get called out for smth I did not do. She said that accepting the direct remarks is a very rare trait and that she liked it.

Even this year when I told her I failed most of my exams she just gave me a disapproving look. By the end of the day she had sent me a detailed consultation and revision plan for the next exams and it's really heartwarming really, even though she didn't really say anything comforting.

After some reflection, I realise that many people do not take direct remarks very well and get offended, which possibly makes ISTJs decide not to interact with them?

I'm not too sure but I would just like to say that I really appreciate my ISTJ, and she offers me support through action rather than words and it's really really comforting.

Continue being who you are, love yall!!

 ***ISTJ Strengths***

**ISTJs** may seem reserved at first, but are very likeable once others get to know them. They have their own brand of humor, and others are drawn to their open and honest nature. They always try to be straight-forward with others ‚Äî a trait that others often appreciate‚Äîand rarely sugar-coat things. **ISTJs** value security and stability, and expect others to follow through on their responsibilities. They hold themselves and others to high moral standards.

**ISTJs** are very strategic and are great problem-solvers. They are very resourceful and are able to adapt easily when necessary. They are able to think critically and logically when making decisions, rarely letting their emotions cloud their judgment. When confronted with a problem, **ISTJs** try to use the information available to make the best decision, hoping for the best. They place a great deal of trust their own judgement, which is based solely off of unbiased logic and reasoning. They have little tolerance for intuitive judgments. Rather, they prefer to evaluate the information available to them and make a decision quickly.

**ISTJs** feel a strong sense of duty. They feel a strong sense of civic duty, and likely vote in every election and seek out opportunities to improve the community. Giving back to the community and helping those in need is especially rewarding for ISTJs.

**ISTJs** have initiative, and others often describe them as ‚Äú*doers*‚Äù. They are very competitive, and are always pushing themselves to be the best. This helps them become very successful in life, particularly in their careers. Others view them as reliable, trustworthy, honest, and likeable.

&amp;#x200B;

 ***ISTJ Weaknesses***

**ISTJs** always stick to their beliefs and values. They trust their own judgement above all others, even when they are wrong. Because of this **ISTJs** can be inflexible and stubborn. Others may see **ISTJs** are too forceful in their decisions.

Because **ISTJs** are so idealistic when it comes to their values, they may be unaccepting or judgmental towards others who do not share those values. They may seek out friends who are like themselves, and/or try fruitlessly to change others.

Because **ISTJs** are so focused on logic and reason, it may be challenging for them to deal with emotions. They have trouble expressing their emotions, as well as feeling empathy for others.

**ISTJs** thrive on structure and routine, and may have difficulty in new or unusual situations. They place a great deal of value on tradition, and change can make them very uncomfortable. **ISTJs** would much rather stick with a tried-and-true method, rather than a new idea that may not work.

&amp;#x200B;

 ***ISTJ Parenthood***

**ISTJs** are very family-oriented and take their responsibilities as parents very seriously. Ultimately, they want their children to grow up to be responsible and hard-working adults like themselves. **ISTJs**‚Äô home environment is very organized, and their children are expected to follow the rules.

&amp;#x200B;

 ***ISTJ Romantic Relationships***

**ISTJs** may have trouble being in-tune with their partner‚Äôs emotions. If their romantic partner is an ‚ÄúF‚Äù (*feeling*) personality type, this can be especially problematic. To overcome this, the F type partner must express their emotions directly with their **ISTJ** partner, rather than just holding them inside.

&amp;#x200B;

 ***ISTJ Friendships***

To an **ISTJ**, friends are secondary to their family. **ISTJs** generally seek out friends who are like themselves ‚Äî someone who is dependable and smart, and shares the same interests and values as themselves. Their friendships centers around trust and loyalty. Friends of **ISTJs** never have to worry about an **ISTJ** betraying them.

**ISTJs** are very aware of their own and others‚Äô social status. They are drawn to others who are well-liked, successful, and respected. However, **ISTJs** heightened awareness of social status can sometimes become overly-concerned with their social status. They may become preoccupied with getting others to like them.

&amp;#x200B;

ISTJ,"Hey folks, istp here asking for your experiences and advice. 

Recently I was able to convince a friend of mine to take the mbti test. I'm pretty sure he is istj, or maybe infj. Problem is that he got tested istp (but like no waterproof indication, he took a test and biggest derivation from middle of eg I vs e, n vs s scale was like 6%) and 'fell in love' with the description. Told him in advance chances are high you get a false result first time etc, but doesn't really help :D also I know functions and stuff, but couldn't motivate him so far to dig deeper yet. 

He sure as hell is a J-type, more so pretty sure istj. Lists always and everything often for the sake of listing/categorizing itself, resulting in problems focusing on the relevant part of the problem, struggles a with self confidence. Which imo does not fit into istp approach to e.g. a problem. 

Now my 2 questions: 
- Do you guys ride motorcycles and love it? Because that's like the part of the description of an istp he went off most to, cause he does.
- how do I convince an istj that he is an istj? :D I'd like him to bc he then might be able to take some advice regarding the typical istj 'problems'from istj which may help him understanding himself.


Tl;dr: friend took test and got istp and loves it. can't convince him that he's istj. How do I do it? + are u riding motorcycles? 

Thank you!",1553520673
ISTJ,"I [ISTJ] and my gf [INTP] just broke up. After, I started learning about mbti and found out I'm ISTJ and I estimate she is INTP. Looking back one thing that seemed to rub me the wrong way, but I never confronted her about, was how blunt she would be when criticizing me. It would make me feel inferior or I'll tell myself ""I'm not good enough"". I now realize this is how she's hardwired. In the end I see that she was just trying to help me be a better version of myself. As anyone else experienced something similar? I'm in the process of trying to change my perspective on criticism and not take it so personal. Is anyone has any tips that might help it'll greatly appreciate it. ",1553480789
ISTJ,"I‚Äôm 18 years old (female intp) and have been with my boyfriend (also intp) for over a year. He is over often and has a good relationship (bf and dad text each other and everything) with my parents and my dad always ‚Äúsays‚Äù that he likes him a lot. Except, to this day if he is over we are not allowed to leave the living room, (can‚Äôt go in mine or any rooms) have to physically be watched, and he can‚Äôt be over when my parents are not home (they are almost never home) to prevent me having him over anyways there are multiple security cameras inside and outside the house to watch me when I‚Äôm home alone. Along with this my dad knows that I am sexually active and safe etc (even though this isn‚Äôt the goal I just want like some privacy?) I think this is extremely excessive considering we are two adults in a stable relationship? How tell him that he needs to back of in a way he‚Äôll understand?",1553471164
ISTJ,"I think my ISTJ friend has feelings for me, but I‚Äôm in a relationship. I‚Äôm curious about this, because from what I‚Äôve gathered ISTJs don‚Äôt develop feelings so much unless they see a future with that person (to be fair, I‚Äôve expressed subtle dismay at my relationship) - please correct me if I‚Äôm wrong. I just don‚Äôt know how I should handle it; I don‚Äôt want to discuss it with him and then have things be really awkward, especially if I‚Äôve simply misread the situation.

**Here are my reasons for thinking he has feelings**:
-we spend hours talking, and often times after we‚Äôve hung out for what we plan to do, he‚Äôll make an excuse to hang out an extra hour or so
-I don‚Äôt like talking openly about my feelings, but something about his stoicism and ability to listen makes it very easy. I feel comfortable around him, and he seems a little more relaxed around me.
-he‚Äôs very casually called me attractive - but it‚Äôs never direct. It‚Äôs always ‚Äúyou look like ____, who is cute‚Äù or ‚Äú____ called you attractive, no surprise.‚Äù
-I‚Äôve heard he compliments me behind my back? I‚Äôve seen him do this with other people though.
-he‚Äôs expressed genuine admiration for me *one* time. But he was awkward about it and barely made eye contact lol.
-I randomly catch him looking at me from a distance


**Here are plausible reasons he doesn‚Äôt**:
-he‚Äôs canceled plans before and has had delays when I suggested we hang out again.
-he doesn‚Äôt initiate plans so much, he‚Äôs expressed he doesn‚Äôt want to make my boyfriend feel weird (he knows he can be a little protective)
-all of those things about ‚Äúif someone likes you they will causally touch you‚Äù - that‚Äôs not us. I could be head over heels in love with someone and I probably still wouldn‚Äôt touch them unless we were dating.
-our conversation comes easiest when we‚Äôre drinking
-he‚Äôs mentioned he has a weird attraction (not romantic attraction, just emotional) to people that need help. I‚Äôm a pretty strong individual so I don‚Äôt think this is the case, but there‚Äôs been once or twice where I‚Äôve been in a bad space and he helped me out.

A tiny bit of background: we went to college together, and we have a friend group that hangs out 3-4 times a week. 

Any insight or advice?",1553454847

ISTJ,"Hi everyone. Recently I've been going through a lot of leadership training and we take these personality tests. Across all of them, I show up as an ISTJ. I love finally knowing my personality type and I feel much more confident knowing what makes me tick. Problem is, sometimes my career doesn't agree.

On one side, I'm in the military so that's perfect for me. But, the job is centered around customer service/ human resources. I'm great at completing requests and helping people with their problems, but I don't get along with my coworkers very well. In our job, it's very easy not to enforce policy on certain things, which drives me crazy. A majority of people in my field are social butterflies and while I would be very successful because I can do way more work, it becomes a daily frustration to work with people who want to leave after 3 hours of ""work"" and I end up naturally picking up the slack to help my members.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been considering other fields such as Law enforcement, the Postal service, and possibly an airline pilot. Part of me thinks continuing in this field may be good long term because I can learn from other peoples perspectives, or be frustrated the rest of my time. What are your experiences with this?

ISTJ,"New relationship, went really well the first few months. I am a combo ISFJ/INFJ. As a result, I tend to hide my negative feelings in order to keep the peace, which was easier to do early on. I also tend to let him take the reins in terms of what to talk about and try to keep up with him intellectually but it was tiring me out. Everything began to pile up and I eventually had an outburst (the first one was just me speaking to him about how I have been feeling, followed by two more emotional outbursts within a matter of a few days). Needless to say, he was blindsided because he wasn't reading me emotionally and thought everything was going great. I've read many posts related to this INFJ/ISTJ combo and similar things happening. I eventually panicked a bit because he was so sure about me and wasn't shy to let me know that he sees a future with me. I felt like it was too early for him to say that but I understand ISTJs tend to pick their partners based on a core set of shared values (which he determined we have). I really like him and put a lot of pressure on myself because of this. I tend to get very insecure and antsy and couldn't help but worry he will change his mind once he gets to know me better. Well, he got to know me better after these emotional displays and was still willing to stay committed and work at it after many conversations trying to understand each other better. He wanted to make it work. But my fear/negativity got the best of me and I broke up with him. He first tried to fight for it and then backed down and said he respects me decision. I miss him terribly... and I still care about him a lot. These past few days have been extremely painful.  I want to reach out and try to make things work with him. But it seems like he is going the cold turkey route. I haven't heard from him since. What is the best way to approach requesting getting a second chance? Would he even give me one? I know I seriously jeopardized his trust in me.  ",1553254785

ISTJ,"As of late, I've noticed that I potentially am really bad at dating.

What I mean is:

1. During actual dates, I find that I frequently run out of things to say. I've always been the type of person to either have not much to say or have something to say but don't really feel like saying them because I feel too tired to keep talking.
2. I find that I tend to say some things a little too directly and might rub some people the wrong way due to that. There was one time I was on a date with someone at a local amusement park and made a comment about the prices even though I was totally still down to have fun at the park. My date took it as a ""damn, I screwed up by taking you here"" and told me afterwards it seemed as if I was complaining the whole time about things. To me, what I said was more of an observational statement than anything. I would have never realized my words hurt him if he never told me. I guess I'm potentially judgy without even knowing I'm being judgy.

ISTJ,"I hope some ISTJ girls with patience can go through this very long and not so organized post. English is my second language. Sorry :(


I am Curious how ISTJ might think while reading this.
 

We dated for 4 - 5 months. I never felt too much love  from her but she kissed me passionatley. I felt so much love and even gave her head, shoulder massages, cared for her because she suffered from anxiety. But, after their friends and her were super drunk on 31st I was upset. But, the reason I have been a jerk, because I wanted to test who she was. Because I wanted to propose/marry not just for fun She was looking for serious things too. But, I did reveal that I manipulated her to understand who she was. Because I was terribly hurt because of an unfaithful person. I am just scared and didnt date for like 5 years after that.

But, I also encouraged and supported her because she suffers from anxiety and depression which she says is because of her Bipolar Mom. She had bad childhood. We broke up 45 days ago.She blocked me, unblocked me for 2 weeks, blocked me again. I didnt reach her except 1 text after she unblocked, she didnt respond. She Uploaded the pic I took on   which I came to know from a friend. I stayed with her during her therapy sessions, and understood her anxiety because I have been there once. she was very happy that she found me because I could understand her shared all her vulnerabilities and had peace. But things turned bad later. Finally wrote her a closure letter as it never happened from my side. What would an ISTJ girl think ? or does my words even matter to her. 


On the cover of the letter I wrote ""Please Trash this letter if you are assuming I am clingy or desperate because that is not true""


Letter starts




Dear X,


I hope you are doing well. As I haven't heard back from you after sending my text. I decided it is better to give closure since It didn't happen from my side after you broke up. I have decided to move on but I want you to know why I have waited all these days, weeks. This letter is not to win you or get back together.¬†I do not like to read a lot and think that looking back is not worth it, just skip to the last numbered lines. I know it is not nessacary but like I said this is my closure I want to express but I did limit. I hope you will understand the value I gave because when there is no hope and we can't change anything there is no logical reason or use in putting time into this letter.


I do not know if you remember me saying this sometimes ""If I love a person, I wouldn't love them even if they become a stone"" it is just the way some people love and they have a lot of empathy towards their loved ones Example your Dad. And I am not a guy who can be clingy or go after a woman, I am not at all desperate. The reason why I texted and tried to explain is because¬†

1. I was emotional because I realized that I myself caused you anxiety/pain which I never thought I would. I really wanted to help you no matter how long it takes, If I have defeated I can make you defeat it is what I believed. 2. I didn't realize this the whole time, no clue that I am causing you anxiety. I realized my mistakes, right after I realized that you were serious about the breakup.


What caused this relationship to fail from my perspective


- I loved you very much but never showed you. The reason for this is not to get hurt the same way my family members did, I became harsher to myself and to you whenever I have emotions for you and I showed it in the form of anger/overprotectiveness for myself. Because emotions are what caused the pain in the past.¬†

- I made you feel I have manipulated you but the fact is I was having so much pain when I am doing it. I had to do it because I wanted to be with you not just for a week or month but all my life and wanted to propose to you in 6 to 8 months or max a year. Although it may cause you pain I wanted to understand who you were at the same time I didn't want to end up with the wrong girl and ruin my life. I realized it is a¬†dumb and unhealthy way.¬†

-I was late for the wedding and didn't respond. It was because I tried to find some jacket and running in Bellevue square mall 2.5 hours before coming here. I wanted to look my best for your friends and did not want to hear any negative comment. I didn't want to show you that I am putting efforts for the relationship. So, I said there was a delay because of the tailor and It made me a terrible person. It is the first time I have ever attended an American wedding and I honestly thought my presence was not important because you are one of the girls next to the bride.¬†

-I failed to understand your personality type and the love you showed Eg: when you said you wanted to spend time next to me It didn't make sense how much it means for you. Because the love I show is very different and I don't think that way.

-***No.1: I had this stupid ideal person who in the real world does not exist and looked/sounded very demanding and harsh. No girl would never be that way.


I feel¬†my actions/words + your anxiety/Negativity ended this relationship. I wish you just listened to me once. The negativity/anxiety overwhelms a person too much that they want to break free from everything and run away.¬†¬†


I wish¬†I didn't talk [I did this toooo many times :( :(¬†¬†]¬† the way that spiked your anxiety. ""I still remember you saying that you didn't sleep for two days and unable to work well"". It was shocking for me because I never thought I would make you feel that way. If I knew something would make you feel that way I would have been very careful with words and actions because my intention was never to make you suffer. I apologize for causing so much anxiety and pressure but I have no clue what I was doing it. Anxiety is terrible I know how it feels Because I have been there. Kate, I wanted to love you through not just your best but also your weaknesses, I believe that is what love is. Anyone can love good but what is special if all we can love is good but not the bad/negative side of a person??


Why I didn't break up after 31st?


I was super mad, upset. I wanted to show my anger which had hurt you. But, I did not want to leave you, GirlsName. Do you know why?¬† I remember you saying me how many times you cried, prayed at the lake alone. I felt so glad to be with you, hold your hand and look into your eyes. I saw an amazing girl inside you. I did not want to break up because I did not want to take away the peace, love and my presence from your life which I thought would cause pain. This made me love you more because loving imperfections need more emotional energy than loving a normal person.¬† I wanted to be with you through the months or years of the fighting process against negativity/anxiety/your bad memories and I was very optimistic to see us as a family together in the future. It may not make sense to Sensing/Thinking type but Like I said what is special to just love goodness?? imperfections should be loved too that is love. It is how I think. I did not know if you were struggling with alcohol but if you were I would have understood better.


I have learned, read, talked to other ISTJ's on Reddit/youtube/forums to understand you better. I did was with the hope that one day you would be willing to text me / talk to me.


Although I decided to move on¬† ""If you ever need me I will be here"" but at the same, I do not want to become cheap for saying this (Just saying because its psychology: ""if we know something will be there for us or if we are going after a person we become cheap""). So everything above is not out of desperation, neediness but¬†my decision to wait for you because I gave you my word many times that ""I would never leave you and I did mean it""¬†It is much stronger than your anxiety. (do not know if you even remember but I said I admire people like your dad wish to be like them). Zero offense or blame But, you didn't keep your word you gave from Indiana that we would talk through things no matter what. And I am not sad but happy and content with my life.¬†¬†


I do not know why you unblocked me and blocked me again on facebook. We are not enemies to be blocked for life. If you miss me feel free to text. If you do not miss or have nothing then you don't have to give a shit because I all the above lines don't have any meaning if that is the case. I can only value you if I can be valued.¬†




Not to discourage or hurt you because I really admire you in many ways. But, If what I am saying isn't true I wouldn't have waited for someone suffering from anxiety but would have rather been dating some  ""My Ethinicity"" girl, someone from church who is slimmer, or with a better job than mine.



Before I end, few lines on how I dealt with my anxiety during family/breakup time issues a couple of years back. Apart from praying, reading, trusting in God

- Believe anxiety can be defeated but it takes time, it is practice.¬†¬†

- Stop the negative thoughts before they come, You can sense them. How¬†do you stop? By replacing your thoughts with little imagination/Goals eg: that improve your life. Workout so hard that your body just needs sleep but not excessive thoughts. or you can Imagine yourself having that car/house or your future life.- start listening to self-help books/Ted talks backed up with research.¬† Although your intention is not to have that car/house, You need to trick your brain. You can't do it in a day but maybe in a month, 3 months or¬† ¬† maybe a year

- Happiness doesn't come from anything but from inside you. It takes months/years to learn. You deserve to be happy, But you need to learn. cherish good things you have.

- Have a goal and be focused on it.

- Love yourself more.




I wish you all the very best X. I pray for you. But, if you hate me more for this letter, my apologies.


Sincerely,

Boy

My friend also shares all these core values as well as other personality traits that I feel will balance him out and work better with his in a romantic relationship. He may not recognize on his own that her traits will work better for him, but he may recognize she has the same set of core values and become interested in her and then discover she may be a better fit later (this is my worst fear).

ISTJ,"Very quick summary of our past: I have an ISTJ whom I consider a friend (he‚Äôs never called me a friend though, only a ‚Äúpeer‚Äù). He is also my boss. I‚Äôd like to say we‚Äôve grown close over our time knowing each other. We‚Äôve spent hours after work just talking and drinking wine. I really enjoy his company, but truthfully I cannot tell if he enjoys mine.

Awhile ago we scheduled a movie night to see his favorite movie. I feel it‚Äôs worth noting I tried to invite other friends and coworkers, and he said they wouldn‚Äôt enjoy the movie.  I wasn‚Äôt trying to make it a private event.

He had to cancel because he got caught up at work. I said we should reschedule if he wanted, he didn‚Äôt respond. I brought it up again awhile later and I said that if he didn‚Äôt want to - it was perfectly fine, then he gave me a date to reschedule. He had to cancel again due to the flu (which is perfectly reasonable).

I ended up watching the movie with my dad when I went home to visit my parents. He mentioned it was in his top 5, and I hadn‚Äôt seen any enthusiasm from my ISTJ friend that he actually *wanted* to spend the time with me, so I figured I‚Äôd rather watch it with people who do like me. 

Here‚Äôs where MBTI comes into this: I can‚Äôt tell if he actually wants to spend time with me or he feels an obligation to as my boss. As an ISTJ would you feel this obligation? I know ISTJs don‚Äôt hang out with people unless they want to, but as my boss, I wonder if he feels he has to force a report with me outside of work.

After he canceled twice and didn‚Äôt try to reschedule either time, I felt a little awkward. I‚Äôm not one to force someone to spend time with me, and if I feel like an inconvenience, I will cease all unnecessary contact with said person. 

I texted him saying I wanted to talk about the movie, and he just responded ‚Äúyou watched it on your own?‚Äù I felt bad, but he didn‚Äôt seem interested in watching it with me, so I feel conflicted.

I don‚Äôt want to open a conversation he doesn‚Äôt want to have (he‚Äôs mentioned he‚Äôs non confrontational), but I do value him *a lot* as a friend. We‚Äôre both a bit awkward and very introverted, so being able to spend time with someone who understands me better than most is really wonderful for me. I‚Äôm the kind of person where when I let someone in, it‚Äôs a big deal. Any input is welcome. I‚Äôm an INFJ if it helps. Thank you.",1552695882
ISTJ,"ENTP here. So I have an ISTJ that I am very interested in, but he keeps giving me extremely wish wash answers on what he wants. However, I believe this is because he is at conflict with himself since the two of us don‚Äôt have the same religious beliefs. But I KNOW he has feelings for me. Nothing else seems to make sense in my mind.

But nothing seems to progress anything because ‚Äúwords‚Äù don‚Äôt seem to be enough for an ISTJ. It seems like the only thing to really make things move forward is through physical action with you guys. 

So...what would you do if you had a crush on someone but had conflicting feelings about it, and they leaned over and just started kissing you? Would you allow it? Would you freak out?",1552670342

ISTJ,"I‚Äôm curious if there‚Äôs a relationship between the ISTJ personality type and attachment style. 

Attachment styles are formed during childhood around the age of two and are directly related to a person‚Äôs relationship with their caregivers. This is important because attachment styles will affect relationships throughout the person‚Äôs life. 

There are four attachment styles which are; secure, anxious-preoccupied, dismissive-avoidant, and fearful-avoidant. Secure has a generally positive perspective. Anxious-preoccupied view themselves poorly and may consider themselves unworthy of affection. Dismissive-avoidant mask their need for emotional attachment behind a shroud of independence. Fearful-avoidant is often formed by trauma, which causes an erratic or constantly changing perspective about themselves and others.

I have the dismissive-avoidant style, but I can‚Äôt tell if it caused me to become ISTJ or if I would have become ISTJ regardless.

What is your attachment style and how has it affected your relationships? Do all ISTJ‚Äôs have the same attachment style? Are personality types and attachment styles mutually exclusive?

ISTJ,"ENFP here. My 31M ISTJ bestie has never had a girlfriend or sex. I want to help but feel like I'm not getting through to him, so I'm looking for advice from others with similar thought processes on how to approach this. 


About him:

Credentials: Smart, tall, fit, good education/career, financially stable. Basically the epitomy of ""nice guy"". Average looks.

Personality: Quiet, stoic, responsible, loyal, and honest. Will stand up and defend things he believes in, and will tear you apart with logical arguments especially if it steps on his morals. Very routine and scheduled.

From what he's told me, he's joined clubs in university, goes to concerts/music festivals, and picked up dancing, all to try and get a gf with no results. He's forced himself to be more social and outgoing, seeing them as traits that women desire. Having failed despite all that, he feels undatable and unlovable and it regularly throws him into depression.


My Thoughts:

Imo he's trying to pick up the wrong types of women. He's attracted to hot, outgoing, friendly girls like those in his dance classes. But to be slightly stereotypical for a second, girls like that don't go for the ""nice, sensitive, smart"" guy.

For example, one of the girls he asked out from his classes turned him down, then dated another guy who's a great dancer, but is 30 with a dead-end job. For another that he was rejected by, I asked ""what kind of guys is she into?"", and his response was ""hot, muscular men - but she says she wants a bf who is like a good friend too!""

My friend's best datable traits are that he's smart, nice, stable, understanding, responsible, and loyal, and imo he needs girls who appreciates THAT about him, not ones in the market for a hot muscular guy.

His friend group of dance girls are hot, but ""vapid"" is the best description I give them. Regardless of how I feel about them though, they're his friends and the type of girl he finds attractive and keeps going for.

Imo if he were to surround himself with smart, nerdy girls who loves history, politics, and games, they'd love him for being him! - except that's not what he's setting his sights on, and he'd rather change everything about himself in the pursuit of a hot, outgoing girl than... find a girl who loves him for him, seemingly.

I've subtly suggested he pick up other hobbies more in line with his intellectual pursuits, a more shotgun approach to dating instead of being so selective, even going to the gym (since the girls he likes are into muscular guys). But every time he says ""I've already tried that. It doesn't work."" or some other excuse. Yet I see him repeat this cycle every few months of finding a hot girl from dance class, asking them out, get rejected, go into depression for a while, repeat.

The truthbomb is: He's an average looking nice guy who really isn't exciting. He needs a girl who appreciates him for his mind and stability. But he surrounds himself with and pursues hot women who are more into muscles/adventure than smarts/reliability. On top of which his inexperience makes him awkward and insecure when pursuing a girl, yet he refuses to date shallowly to get experience.

I've tried to subtly tell him this without hurting his feelings, since telling him this stuff directly doesn't suggest an understandable action plan and only serves to tear into the self-esteem of my depressed friend even more by telling him he's not good enough for the types of girls he wants. 

I hate seeing him depressed, but I'm really out of ideas on how to push him in the right direction anymore or what's preventing him from realizing what's wrong (despite many subtle hints) and stepping out of it.",1552345510

&amp;#x200B;

\[INTP\] recently reconnected with my first puppy love \[ISTJ\] - very short lived, but I suppose we never had true closure. Unexpectedly journeyed home for the first time since I left at 18 due to an emergency, unexpectedly hung out (his moves), unexpectedly kept in touch after I left. My hometown takes 3 days to fly to and is too much of a hassle for most folks to go home more than once every 5 years and that's a lot. So I believe we both knew where we stood afterwards and didn't think we'd reconnect until I came back, if ever. 

I was perfectly fine leaving it at a hi-bye, but here we are, friends and other things, but not romantic, I don't think. He's not much of a talker, but in its own way, his presence helped me through some of the scariest times of my life health-wise, despite the distance. We fell into a text groove, and then one day, while talking about some very personal things, he said some things that bothered me. I tried to clarify, which only caused him to become hostile. I was going through some of the worst PTSD symptoms then, so I decided to stop talking to him for a while and focus on getting back to center. After about a month, I reconnected and explained that I needed a time out because I felt misunderstood and explained that, after a lifetime of feeling misunderstood, I feel most cared for when people try to understand me. 

Eventually we slipped back into our initial groove, and then I - again, unexpectedly - got tickets to go back home and let him know as much. Out of the blue he.. stopped communicating. Didn't mind at first, after all, I'm more introverted than he is and am awful at texting, we both know logistics will keep us this way unless the unlikely life-changing event somehow brings us both within proximity and miraculously perfects our lives, lol. The next time he texted it was actually kind of endearing, he knew my last high school almost-sweetheart (now family/platonic) was over for a week for some conference and texted me some flirtatious stuff randomly. (Read: This is one reason I left my hometown, it's a tiny community. Ever watched Crazy Rich Asians? We have our own version of that blitzkrieg gossip, lol. However given how far I've made it alive I am not one to close my doors to fellow colleagues trying to make it in America and that is a separate story.)

Over time, his blatant dismissal of my coming home started to bother me - and I quickly figured out that it was because he made it into my tiny tiny circle(!!!), that none of it had happened in order, and because it was inconsistent from what I was used to. What was more frustrating was that I, again, unexpectedly am scheduled to make this pilgrimage back home, and he, after months of telling me we'd do xyz next time we met up, was ignoring my texts. Yep, I had inadvertently verified he was. Now, I am the least controlling person and will literally leave a situation at the slightest sign of intolerable discomfort - which is a slow build and rarely happens. After what had happened previously and given it was something he said we'd do, I was beginning to weary and quite tempted to just drop him right there. I'm trying to be a better person aka not ghost people, and after everything I had been through he seemed to be a good individual to include in my life. So I told him as much, to let me know how he felt if he could, that it would mean a lot. This is about a month later, mind you. Right as I'm deciding to let it go completely, he responds with a simple ""just so you know, I can go months without checking messages.""

All this discomfort was already beginning to dredge up some crap - some from past abusive relationships, some from our own (ahem, HIS) teenage blunders. I was ready to move on, so I hesitantly thanked him and told him shit was still in his court re: hanging out. No response. Again, I do see that he responds to everyone else, though, so I check myself accordingly and go back to my own life. This was another 2 weeks in and I was tired of feeling nagged by these thoughts despite a busy life, so I decided to let him go again. Shortly after that day, he responds ""Ok."" Third time in 3 months.

Christ Lord and Savior. I am all for being solid friends / FWB, but the key to even those successful relationships is mutual respect, communication and consistency. In the beginning all three were very present hence my pleasant surprise and resulting enthusiastic participation in this new connection, but now even the first feels shaky at best. I have expressed I do not mind what life he leads outside of our friendship, so long as I'm safe, which I think is a generous helping of my time as it is. All this being somewhat long distance, me already having communicated openly and not necessarily receiving the same makes me wonder if this is even worth continuing or if I'm being breadcrumbed / trauma bonding. As a more extreme introvert than he is, I am very well aware of the possibility of him just living life normally, recharging and the whole proximity thing, but I am also known to have learned empathy a little too well, to the point of self-destruction. I worry I'm on my way, I'm questioning myself and have been on the fence since. I know you're not supposed to question your feelings and whatnot, but anyone who knows INTPs understands penchant for objectivity is both a gift and a recipe for disaster. Oftentimes I have no idea how I feel, and nagging bouts like this is exactly what will eventually cause me to bolt upright in bed hours, a day, a week, most usually years later and have the ""a-ha!"" moment of clarity and ensuing sadness, rage, etc. It is also what has put me in very toxic situations, which I have no capacity for. It feels like a lose-lose situation either way and the only thing that seem remotely comforting is the EXIT button, lol. Doesn't seem responsible but seems like it would be a relief.

I have scoured the 'net for ISTJ things which is obviously already a bad sign.

ISTJ,"Hello, I‚Äôm ESFP (f/27) and recently an ISTJ (m/36) caught my interest (just a few weeks ago). I‚Äôve dated ISTJ and ESTJ before and in my experience they really stare you down when they like you. This new guy though goes to my gym, and when we talk he will barely make eye contact with me. I feel like he is internally having a panic attack and just gets very awkward. This is to the point where I have tried to end our conversations early just to relieve him of the awkwardness. I don‚Äôt want to force someone to talk to me if they just want me to go away. Every time I do this though he finds 100 more things to talk about and keep the conversation going. For example, I tried to make my exit after a 10 minute convo and he ended up talking for another hour and obviously trying to be funny‚Äîbut looked past me the whole time. I have never experienced this before. I cannot read him at all. 

Do ISTJ do this when they don‚Äôt like someone but want to be polite, or when they do like someone and don‚Äôt know how to act?

ISTJ,"My boss is an ISTJ and very good with certain things (like spreadsheets, and other fact-based things). However, sometimes he gets tunnel vision and really can't see the forest for the trees and gets really caught up on if something is 100% literally factual or not. He's an editor and when I turn in pieces to him, he will often compare the two and try to point out discrepancies as if catching me in a lie and then use that as proof to say that I have to turn in a factual story, etc. The thing is, none of these stories are wildly inaccurate (and my ESTP coworker has had more beefs with him on this than me so I know it's not just me), it's just that some things turn out to need a little tweak here and there with language to make it more accurate. But that's part of the revision and editing process. But when he talks to me about them, it feels like he's trying to corner me and shame me into feeling like I did something terribly wrong. And sometimes he will be so stubborn about one of his edits when I try to make the point to him that another way of wording something is better that it feels like I'm talking to a stone wall and I feel completely shut down.

ISTJ,"First of all, I am gay (this is relevant to the story). Recently (three months ago), I became what I perceived to be as ‚Äúgood friends‚Äù with my ENFP friends ISTJ cousin. My friend warned me that he was super, super anxious, negative, and a little crazy. 

However once we started talking we hit it off like...immediately. Absolutely none of the things my friend had warned me about even seemed to exist in this person. He was super chill, funnyC and responsive in conversation. We had similar interests, views, etc. Pretty soon we were getting coffee super often for like four hours and talk about his beliefs, views, family, etc. I was super interested in his life because he‚Äôs a history buff like I am. We would text every day off on and on and I genuinely thought we were super good friends. He seemed just as invested in the subjects we would talk about as I was with him. However, I knew he was straight so I was NOT interested in him. 

Here‚Äôs the thing: the entire time we would talk, he would often talk major shit on his cousin who was our mutual friend. I would agree with some of the stuff he said, especially after his cousin had painted him in such a negative light- but for the most part just sort of zone it out.

For the last few weeks, we have been hanging out and getting coffee. We always got along and are always on the same page. I‚Äôll admit, I may have been slightly flirty but we talked about it and he confirmed he is 100% straight. Cool. Whatever? Idgaf? I‚Äôm fine with just being friends. He also seemed cool with this and after that it was over. Completely done.

...in the mean time, my ENFP friend has been becoming more distant. Weird...? But whatever. He can do whatever he wants....anyway, this morning I texted the ISTJ and asked if he wanted to go longboarding after work. Rat afterward I‚Äôm suddenly hit with this: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve gotta get this off the table. Have you at some point been into me? I don‚Äôt know how clear I need to make myself. I‚Äôm not gay‚Äù.

What the fuck? Where did this come from? We already went over this. So I call and explain to him that although I think he‚Äôs attractive, that I am NOT into him because he is straight. He asked me to be 100% honest so I was. That‚Äôs the truth. Then, he was like ‚ÄúOkay good‚Äù and I said ‚ÄúStill friends?‚Äù and he made some weird Seinfeld reference.

Suddenly my ENFP friend texts me and says something along the lines of: ‚ÄúHey, ISTJ and I were talking and he has been saying that you have been saying some weird things to him about me. Do you know what I‚Äôm talking about at all...?‚Äù

So I message the ISTJ. I am BLOCKED. What. The FUCK?

So I tell the ENFP friend straight up that sometimes I rant about him and say stuff- so I get honest and tell him the issues I have with him. The entire time I‚Äôm just baffled that the ISTJ would throw me under the bus when HE said 90% of the shit.

So as me and the ENFP talk, it turns out that the ISTJ has been talking major, major shit about me to the ENFP- saying I‚Äôm overbearing, obsessed with him, always trying to talk to him, etc. I‚Äôm just dumbstruck. None of what is being said connects and absolutely none of it adds up to how great the ISTJ and I have been getting along. Like we ALWAYS get along and even when the gay thing happened he just seemed to brush it off...WRONG.

I then tell the ENFP that whenever we talk about him, is it almost always the ISTJ talking shit. He always talks badly about his ENFP cousin but then when he‚Äôs with his ENFP cousin he is talking badly about *me*....even when he was confiding in me about life and acting like we were best friends. He completely betrayed me AND the ENFP. I feel betrayed and frankly hurt. I don‚Äôt understand why he would ‚Äúpretend‚Äù to be friends with me and then talk shit to the ENFP, and then pretend to be best buds with his ENFP cousin and then talk major shit about him to me. I‚Äôve never met someone so, so two faced in my entire life. Both of us are so confused. This who thing almost destroyed my friendship with the ENFP because we were both getting completely different stories.

Here‚Äôs the thing: I genuinely think the ISTJ really likes me being my friend- however I think he‚Äôs ashamed to admit it. Like I don‚Äôt believe any of the shit he claimed to think about me to the ENFP at all. I really just don‚Äôt understand.

Thoughts? I know he is an unhealthy ISTJ...but put yourself in his shoes for second: why is he acting this way? What the fuck is going on that makes him do this? ",1551819869
ISTJ,"So my boyfriend is an ISTJ and I‚Äôm an ENFP and we‚Äôve had many arguments. I don‚Äôt think we can go a week or two without arguing about something. Usually it‚Äôs because I feel like he doesn‚Äôt understand me as well. Last night I brought up how I wanted him to change his tone when he talks to me because he sounds so aggressive and that I‚Äôve been unhappy because of it. When he talks to me in such an aggressive tone it makes me feel like I‚Äôm being yelled at or something, especially when I‚Äôm going to him to vent about something.... Anyways this convo escalated to the point of breaking up. I was the one that made him break up with me which was stupid of me. I know I‚Äôm the one at fault here. I called him back to talk about it and it ended it with him saying that he‚Äôll try to fix it even though it‚Äôs been a reoccurring problem. And ever since last night he hasn‚Äôt messaged me or anything so it‚Äôs making me worry and overthink. I know he probably feels hurt right now over what happened last night and then me literally calling him back right after.... sigh. My emotions took over me and i was just in the heat of the moment. I talked to a close friend about this and she definitely said I was at fault here and that I should apologize. But right now since I know he‚Äôs hurt about this whole situation and probably mad and annoyed I don‚Äôt want to bother him. What do you guys think I should do? Should I just give it one or two days to let us cool down or message him now saying I‚Äôm sorry? Since I feel so bad I don‚Äôt want to bother him even more.

ISTJ,"My ex, an ISTJ, has one of my favorite books of all time. I‚Äôd like him to pop it in the mail. How can I ask him to do it without seeming like I‚Äôm looking for a way to reconnect? Previously, even when I was very straightforward, he‚Äôs made incorrect assumptions and tries to read between the lines. Even when I‚Äôm just communicating matter of factly.

The reason why I‚Äôm overthinking the transaction is because I really really want the book ‚Äì¬†without getting looped into any other back-and-forth.

I have notes in the margins, highlighted portions. So that copy is way more valuable to me than a crisp, new one. When I let him borrow it, I explained that it was sentimental. Right now, he has a backlog of books to read for work and it‚Äôs not a priority at all.

ISTJ,"I am an ENFP guy recently ISTJ girlfriend broke up.

Istj girlfriend 28 year: Depressed/suffers from anxiety and negetive thinking because of her childhood experiences with bipolar mom

She was very happy because I was able to understand her depression and was with her after therapy sessions. She was so peaceful that I came into her life.
In the beginning of our relationship she and her friends got drunk too much which was a huge turn off for me. I almost wanted to breakup..I was mad at her. She started crying. I told myself to forgive her and never to leave her because I did not want to take away that happiness or peace which she got after years. I never told this to her though but I had to love her more because it is my decision to be with her. I forgave her but also had to love her more so that her value in my heart doesnt go down (its a decision)

I was mad about her friends for couple of weeks whenever she said she is meeting them. Thats it one day she broke up. I literally begged her(not out of desperation but to explain why I didnt break up with her). She blocked me everywhere and its been 30 days.

ISTJ's are freaking blind for emotions. Who would want to not breakup with a few extra pounds,durkard, depressed and anxious person? I dont have any benfit from my decision but its my decision to love her bring her out of her pain. It is the worst feeling when your mind doesn't listen to you.


You may ask why I decided?

I wanted to be with her and give her strength because I have been there (anxiousness) and I know the pain.I was optimistic about our life together. 

Because pain is pain for anyone. No one should deserve pain or suffering. Is someone is going through pain it is our responsibility as a human to bring them out of it. 

Example : 
""Pain of you breaking your finger, tears, suffering= pain of someone breaking their finger, tears, suffering""

If you want to avoid your pain then someone should also be helped/helped to avoid breaking their finger.

Update:

I met an ESFJ, ENFP(exactly my type and also I really liked), and talked to many girls in this month because ENFP quickly want to avoid/skip breakup pain by replacing it with someone or something. But it didnt work for me this time. I myself told the Esfj, enfp girls that it wont work and disconnected with other girls because I coukdbt take this istj girl out of my mind.

She unblocked me over fb but not of instagram. I texted her over phone but no response. Istj's see only their way but no other possibilities or alternatives. You are brutal to others and also yourselves but you dont realise that because you don't see it.

I admire your personality type when it comes to planning, decision making and dedication.

ISTJ,"Alternate title: Is the MBTI the Thinking Man's horoscope?

My background: 

&gt;!I spent most of my life up to age 25 struggling (and failing) to understand myself and other humans. Fortunately, my 1st employer out of grad school paid for my 1st MBTI test, where I came out as an ESTJ. This helped me somewhat. A failed relationship 3 years later made me realize I'm an \*I\*STJ (I think I answered the original test in a manner that skewed towards extroversion, as only very recently has the stigma around introversion started to go away.)

Since then, my understanding of myself and others has gone through the roof. I know my limits, exactly which situations and people I'll thrive in and around, etc. My self definition has solidified, resulting in breakthrough confidence, among other things.

Basically, I'm the poster child for the MBTI: the person who was lost at sea about themselves until they took the test.!&lt;

However, in recent years there've been a lot of really well thought out and valid attacks on the test (such as this [one](https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2013/mar/19/myers-briggs-test-unscientific).)

How do you folks who found the test as life changing as I did reconcile that with it possibly not being accurate or giving useful results?",1551384471
ISTJ,"Btw my English sucks, but please bear with me
Hey, so as the title says, I need help trying to figure out why my ISTJ buddy behaves the way he does, without dissecting him, it would be too invasive, don't you think?
Anyway, we were having a discussion, he stated that the sole purpose of life is just to be happy and enjoy, which triggered my disagreement immediately. We had discussions on this topic quite a few times, but each time it ended up with me explaining why he should be precise with his terms and not mix them up all the time. This time I had a lot of spare time, so I decided to finally answer him fully without him interrupting, he asked me why I think happiness is not the purpose of life.
I, being excited to finally be able to articulate my argument fully, wrote a soul crushing argument, and gave him the alternative point of view, to which he responded - I see where you're coming from but I'll stick to my ways, not to say your argument is bad, it's just that we all have a right to our own opinion. I mean sure - we all have that right, but that doesn't make every opinion equally as good.
Now I honestly would just give up on talking with him about deep topics, but I don't want him to screw himself over, I honestly care about him(Fe inferior)

I'm currently in College and thruout the semesters I had made a few connections with classmates. They always seemed enthusiastic to come in and just casually talk before/after classes.

Most of those connections, they have been extroverts. While I understand some are super open and everyone they talk to is their ""friend."" I feel like they ""forget"" me.

I usually wouldn‚Äôt say things like this, but I‚Äôm GENUINLY not sure.

Although he has been on a few dates with women, he has never pursued any of them seriously and *never* talks about girls- not even to his cousin. He went on a date few days ago and said it was just ‚Äúweird, awkward talk‚Äù. He never seems to care of find the ambition to really want one in his life. Supposedly it‚Äôs like this with every girl here ever meets. It never goes anywhere.

Although we only met two months ago, we hit it off enough that he and I text constantly- like to the point that we talk all day, even when he‚Äôs at work. He initiated half the texts, I initiate the other half. He asked me if I wanted to get coffee two days ago and we talked nonstop for almost four hours.

We just get along super well and I can honestly say I‚Äôve never had such a fluid conversation with someone like that. If I weren‚Äôt dead dog tired we could have talked for even longer.

After that, we were texting and I asked him why he doesn‚Äôt go out and do stuff with girls- he claims he just has no interest. I asked why, he said he doesn‚Äôt really know. Then I ‚Äújokingly‚Äù (ok but honestly I was completely serious lmao) said ‚ÄúWell, if you‚Äôre ever bored and want to be like those party girls in movies we could make out in a totally platonic, no feelings, disassociated way‚Äù.

Managed to do some small talk where he asked questions about myself back, but I felt as if I had to be the one to extend the conversation. Later that night, I asked a friend of his what he thought of me, and my friend promised to ask him. So, the second time I see him, my friend tells me that apparently he thought I was really attractive, and says that he's probably interested and that I should give it a shot. We all go out to a club, and I notice that this guy I like is sober and sort of lingering in the back by himself. Eventually, my friends decide to leave the both of us alone and he asks if I'd like to get a drink with him. When we get our drinks we go outside to have a conversation, and this is where things start to get confusing....

I'm used to guys being the one to lead you around, and initiating most of the action (For instance, I do think its worth noting that earlier I had to be the one to ask if he had instagram and he enthusiastically gave me his account and followed me back immediately... Moving on tho...) I noticed that as we were walking to the smoking patio he kept following me around rather than the opposite... (generally speaking most guys I've interacted with would be the one to lead the way, hold your hand, or lightly drag your shoulder across the room from one end to the other).... So then, the conversation I had with him is like our very first where it's me just asking him questions about his interests, basic life story, and all this nonsensical small talk, and he occasionally gave some lengthy answers but once again he seemed rather silent and unemotional.. 

Eventually I sort of get closer to him, like lightly lean against his arm as we're conversing (mainly because some guy rudely interrupted our conversation and tried to talk to me... wanted to give this stranger a signal that I was with someone else)... and he doesn't seem repulsed or seems to retaliate against my touch or anything... but there was no emotional response or reaction to the physical contact... I don't think I made him uncomfortable or anything because we continue the conversation as it was.. but later on when we're alone again and back at our halls (I'm in uni)... we decide to sit on the couch just to chill, I decide to lean my head against his shoulder and the same response... no reaction whatsoever... never asked me to stop cuddling, but he didn't reciprocate the physical contact either (with other guys usually more light displays of physical affection are returned like an arm around my waist or shoulder or something, but with this guy it's nothing...) I couldn't tell if I made him uncomfortable or whatnot?

He found that brain scans of introverted types in each quadra begin to resemble one another (A quadra being STJs and NFPs etc- types who use the same functions) as do the Extraverted types. 


I can‚Äôt tell you how many ENFPs I‚Äôve interacted with that resembled ESTJs I‚Äôve interacted with.

I‚Äôve always been very close to ISTJs. We get along well, see eye to eye and seem to be my favorite type. As I‚Äôm approaching 40 though it‚Äôs surprising just how much I‚Äôm begging to approach the world like one. Whereas you all engage with Fi/Ne more. 


Unfortunately I can‚Äôt find that particular Nardi interview. This article doesn‚Äôt go in depth:

https://eu.themyersbriggs.com/en/Knowledge-centre/Blog/2013/August/Neuroscience-of-Personality-Your-Brain-and-Type

It‚Äôs probably very nuanced but I can pattern recognize it. I feel the shift within as well. 


**Have you guys noticed any resemblance to the INFP with age?**

I just suggest when you think about it don‚Äôt consider the stereotypical shit we tend to hear about both types.

ISTJ,"Hi ISTJs. I just posted a comment in another sub [Tangent, actually some of you might be interested in checking that out too, it's new and called NoNonsenseMBTI and so far seems way more sane than r/mbti]. 

Anyway, as the title says, I'm curious to get your take on my accuracy (or not) of my understanding/description of ISTJ ""predicting based on past experiences"" in my description. 

Pasting below some excerpts. The original comment, which includes the compare and contrast with my process as an INFJ is [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/NoNonsenseMBTI/comments/arykeo/weekly_discussion_thread_2182019/egqut2a/).

------------------------------

**Context**

&gt;My SO (ISTJ) and I (INFJ) are entering a phase of figuring out whether we should take a really significant step in our relationship. Typical for us, we're being cautious. Each in our own ways. She's ISTJ enneagram 9 (not sure the wing). I'm INFJ enneagram 6w5.

&gt;One thing that has come up for us both is that we each have our way trying to predict whether it is likely to be okay for us to do this... and in our discussion, the fundamental unreliability of 100% certain prediction of whether it will actually work out for us. Like, there is a point at which deciding based on our modes of prediction doesn't work. Nonetheless, we each have thing about prediction and our own ways of trying to do it.

&gt;We both require information, but of different kinds.

-------------------------

My attempts at description of what it is for her, based on my understanding thus far:

&gt;For her, prediction is built on a build-up of everyday experiences with me over time, which in turn is layered on what she has experienced in past relationships. For her, then, trying to predict if this step will be okay requires time for adding more everyday experience with me. I'm not sure if I'm describing it accurately here, doing the best I can though.

and

&gt;So the upshot is - time is important to us both, but for different reasons. ... For her, the time itself is at the core - just having the ongoing lived experience of us together in the details of everyday life and checking internally if that sits well with her for a more serious commitment than we have right now.** 

and

&gt;I can't really imagine what it's like internally to try to make decisions in a predictive way based on an accumulation of everyday experience in the past and present. Because for me, the future is just its own part of a landscape and it is arranged however it is arranged - it doesn't naturally arrange itself in past-harnessed terms of what comes before it. There's not a straight line there, in my perception. For her, though, that lived experience is solid and the best way for her to try to predict what is mostly likely to happen. For me, there are links between points in time, but nothing that can reliably be used predictively from the accumulated details of everyday experience. But I see that for her, this is real and solid and important.

ISTJ,"Hey Reddit, my name is jetplane48 (ESTP 7w8 sx/sp) and I am starting up a podcast in relation to MBTI. Fundamentally, the goal of the podcast is to educate the viewers of several Typology systems through a series of one-on-one's with others who are interested in the same topics. I have been conducting interviews for many years (MBTI related) and this is just an extension of that, however, I want to discuss topics that the audience wants me to cover. Naturally, I'll come up with my own material but I would love to explore topics that others have in mind. I am busy with school for the next few months but when I finish, the goal is to eventually be more consistent with these podcast uploads if this turns out to be popular enough. I'm very excited to get this started, and let's see some questions!

ISTJ,"My boss is an ENTJ. He thinks that I am trying to pull one over him all the time. For instance, I had a project that I had to work on that involved processing files. It was an urgent project. He asked for an estimate to get the project done and I said a week based on how much time it took me initially. Now, I've always learned to give myself a buffer--it stops me from overpromising and burning out too hard in case trouble arises. The number of files I had to process were in the hundreds as opposed to a handful that I usually get.

I made the process extremely efficient ended up processing those files 2-3 days earlier than expected. I stayed late for 1.5 hours one night just to get some extra work in. When he asked for an update two days later, I mentioned that I finished it and he was surprised--not in a good way. I shrugged it off because I got the work done right?

A week later we have a meeting and he points out this specific scenario as an example that ""[you] don't know how to manage your time"" and that ""[you] don't know what [you're] doing if I'm giving timelines like this"". And that he can't trust me on this project because I don't know how to organize myself because my timing appears to be extremely off? I'm paraphrasing.

I don't get it. I got the work done earlier than expected so I can pass it off to someone else to start. What's the issue? Sure, I overestimated, just so I can provide a buffer. And yes, I powered through given the urgency of this project. And I didn't lie.

Should I have just twiddled my thumbs and not doing anything for an extra 2-3 days? Should I just have lied about the progress of the project?",1550527114

ISTJ,"I recently met an ISTJ, we hit it off really well, I have never met someone so structured in my life, it really piqued my curiosity and things started to speed up in our romantic relationship. But out of the blue, He‚Äôs told me that he can‚Äôt keep up, so we‚Äôve had a break with no contact this last week. It was honestly really hard for me, but I knew that he needed the space to recuperate. I waited patiently for him to contact me when he‚Äôs ready and he did so today and we‚Äôre meeting tomorrow.

Should I listen to my gut and stop seeing him, if my ENFP energy is too much for him? Or should I keep exploring the possibility. As complete opposite people, are we too different to make a romantic relationship work? How do ISTJ approach the decisions to become exclusive?

I think the factor behind it might be due to where I'm an intern at. My boss is an incompetent twat and isn't portrait as someone I would take orders from.

ISTJ,"I (20 M) want to get out and meet people. More specifically girls. Right now I basically come home from work and do stuff on the internet until I go to bed. Then I wake up, go to the gym, go to work repeat. 

Only time I really go out is when I go grocery shopping. It's not that I'm afraid of people or anything. I just have no interest in doing anything else. I literally cannot think of a single hobby I would be interested in that involves others.

The only way I can think of meeting girls is by talking to store employees. But, I know this would be seen as annoying after awhile, and they are just trying to do there jobs. There are no girls where I work, so that's off the table. Online dating has yielded a few matches but no dates as of yet. Meeting girls through friends hasn't worked out too well either, as those girls don't really seem interested.

I understand that to meet girls means I must meet people. If I go out to just meet girls, that will get me no results. However my motivation to meet more people is to meet girls. Kind of a catch 22. I heard about volunteering, but I'm really passionate about a cause, and if I join a group to meet girls, and there are no girls, then it is waste and not something I can commit to.

I work full time (in a career, not just a job.) I'm not in school. I've been told that I'm a 7/10. On a bad day maybe a 6. My work takes up most of my time, and a lot of my experiences are from my job. Aside from doing stuff on the internet I have no real hobbies.

ISTJ,"A coworker of mine had a birthday the other day, and she decided she wanted a murder mystery party. Many of my coworkers were there, including our manager and friend (the ISTJ in question). 

I get it, ISTJs aren‚Äôt the first people I think of when I think party, or acting. My dad is also an ISTJ and he doesn‚Äôt even want to go to poker night (something he enjoys) because it‚Äôs too many people, he would avoid a murder mystery party like the plague. The fact my manager showed up at all (in costume, too!) was a pleasant surprise. This is the part that confuses me: he was being an asshole all night long. 

The coworker who hosted the party put a ton of effort into this event, and before it had even started he was saying things like ‚Äúwhat if I don‚Äôt care who the murderer is?‚Äù and ‚Äúwhat if I don‚Äôt really want to be here?‚Äù When we switched to being ‚Äúin character‚Äù he got actively worse. I didn‚Äôt expect him to fully commit or anything, but to purposely make it hard to talk or interact with him at all, seemed unnecessary. At the end he said  to our coworker who wrote it ‚Äúif you ever do this again, and I hope you don‚Äôt...‚Äù which *visibly* upset him.

Here‚Äôs the thing, he isn‚Äôt an asshole. I know he‚Äôs a softie underneath all of that, I‚Äôve just never seen him take it this far. He‚Äôs a smart man, so he understands that someone‚Äôs hard work and legitimate effort aren‚Äôt the best target for insult, even if it was meant in jest. Was it a defense mechanism because he was uncomfortable? Did he just feel so far out of his depth that he reverted to being overly sarcastic? Was he trying to avoid being invited to these again?

I want to talk to him about it. I plan to be honest and concise, but any insight into how you would feel in this scenario would be beneficial. Thank you!

is being co-workers a really big deal breaker to potentially starting a relationship? when he says he wouldn't cross it, is it absolute? while I'm thinking positively about our relationship dynamic and our potential, has he already made up his mind about it and isn't even wasting time thinking about furthering our relationship?",1549916821

ISTJ,"Before anything, I'd like to thank everyone in other mbti communities for helping me learn a but more about how the cognitive functions work. Overall I've gotten a good foundation on what type I am. From what I learned, I'm most likely not an INTP mostly due to the fact that I kinda see myself as rigid when it comes to my own way of working, and in general my goals. What made me used to think I was an INTP was of how I tend to be rebellious and outspoken, to the point of sarcasm when i felt that I was treated badly and I was miserable. My best friends who were INTPs were usually huge procrastinators with projects which annoyed me, but I always enjoyed talking to INxPs in general because they and i tend to be on the same wavelength in conversations, but that's as far as it goes. Overall I'm just gonna give a bit of more info about myself and see what vibe you guys get.

But now with my current job as a Logistics Admin assistant, I pretty much feel more confident and more at home, to the point where i feel more prestigious in my life. I used to work In fast food and always felt like I was constantly seen as incompetent due to me having my ""head in the clouds"" or focusing on other things other than the menial work I was given. At my new job, it has purpose. Logistics on the other hand is the organization and coordination of everything. Literally my job is to be myself, organized, structured, and factual, which I love! 

In my life, I was always seen as shunning any ideas that I saw as out of place, and viewed my way as the best way. My best friends saw me as very outspoken and blunt, to the point of being openly cruel and heartless about others for selfish gain. And the funny part is that I was a bit immature back then and took pride in that. I'd rather be viewed as cruel and heartless than weak and incompetent. My views on it is that I value being on top of everything, not leaving everything to last, and most of all, work towards the goals that are revelant in your life.

My mannerisms tend to be of someone who is reserved, but arrogant at times. I don't mind this as I have a reason to be. If I am surrounded by disorganization, I will be anxious and WILL make my voice be heard, or I will have huge anger issues. I like having a calm and clean look, I usually try to look presentable because I want to pretty much show myself as someone who is efficent...and appearances matter especially when you want to prove a point. Most of the time though, especially if I'm somewhere unfamiliar, I become incredibly reserved, to the point where I kind of have to force myself to smile.

Another thing about me is that I focus more on things than people in all honesty. I like focusing on video games, lore, stories, and things that are considered long-term. I daydream about a future where I own a company and I can finally work in the background while I have everything in control and consistent. Anything that seems late or delayed I can be frustrated easily.

I love how we are in many levels the opposite and can push each other in some areas. For example his careful organization sometimes makes him exausted and prevents him from enjoying the moment, while my ""on the go"" approach shatters his rigid regime and makes him go ""maybe I should just chill"". i have countless examples like this.

**ISTJ ‚Äì The Inspector**

**What Stresses out an ISTJ:**  
‚Äì Being in an environment that is in disarray  
‚Äì Looming deadlines  
‚Äì Being forced or asked to do things that don‚Äôt make sense to them  
‚Äì Being asked to do something without a plan or direction  
‚Äì Frequent change  
‚Äì Having to innovate without any past experience to rely on  
‚Äì Being asked to do something spontaneously  
‚Äì Too much extraversion (excess people contact)  
‚Äì Emotionally charged situations  
‚Äì Unfamiliar surroundings  
‚Äì Dealing too long with abstract or theoretical concepts.

When faced with stress overload, ISTJs may fall into ‚Äúcatastrophe mode‚Äù, where they see nothing but all the potential of what could go wrong. They may beat themselves up; berating themselves for things which could have been done differently, or duties which they failed to perform. They will lose their ability to see things calmly and reasonably, and can become depressed at what they see as a bleak future. Under chronic stress, the ISTJ may fall into the grip of their inferior function, extroverted intuition, and become a ‚Äúdramatizer‚Äù. They may become intensely angry, rigid in what they‚Äôre doing, outwardly critical, pessimistic, and embrace an overwhelming fear of the future.

**How to help an ISTJ experiencing stress:**  
‚Äì Give them plenty of space.  
‚Äì Listen, and provide provable affirmation of how they‚Äôve overcome or done something well in the past.  
‚Äì Break a task down into manageable pieces.  
‚Äì Do not give generalized compliments.  
‚Äì Put things that have to be done in sequential order.  
‚Äì Don‚Äôt brainstorm. If they are in the grip of their inferior function, extroverted intuition, brainstorming will only make things worse.  
‚Äì Don‚Äôt give them more to do. Give them a break from responsibilities if possible.  
‚Äì Take them seriously. Don‚Äôt patronize or judge them.  
‚Äì Encourage them to exercise, unless this would sound like an insult.",1549387678

He‚Äôs extremely absent minded and always in his head .

ISTJ,"Hello everyone. I like this girl for about 3 months now. I've met her online and been chatting with her in Facebook almost everyday. I always initiate the conversations because I'm a really clingy guy. She replies thoughtfully and nice. Most of the time she even adds emoticons to her replies (if that means anything).

Then the communication between us lessened because she got a job that she loves working on. I've been keeping in touch with her sometimes by sending a ""hope you have a nice day"" in the mornings and asking how her day went when she's home from work. It's been harder for me to talk to her because we don't chat anymore like we used to. Her replies got bland and serious. I just assumed that it was because she's stressed and tired from the workload and the change.

I asked her out to watch a movie with me just recently and l made it clear to her that it was a date. I must say it was pretty successful considering it was my first time asking someone out and I think it's her first time too. We talked about a lot of things and I even gave her a gift. I know how you guys don't like gifts that much but I tried to be as practical and thoughtful as much as possible. It's an earphones cable clip organizer because we were talking about it before and I really wanted one too so I got her too. She said it was really cute (it's her favorite character) and thanked me.  After the date she messaged me online, she thanked and wished me a safe trip going home.

For a few days after the date we were chatting online normally again and then she got busy again from work and returned from her 'serious mode' again. So I apologized and asked her if I was bothering her because I keep on trying to chat her everyday. It took her the whole day to think about what to reply (she saw the message in the morning). She said she didn't know what to say and I shouldn't be sorry because she's actually grateful that there's someone who cares about her.

I asked her out again to eat dinner after work. I suggested Monday but she said that she doesn't like that day. So I asked her when does she want and her reply was ""no idea yet"". My friends says that she rejected it and she's not interested anymore.

I really overthink a lot and it does feel like she's not interested with me anymore. Should I just stop initiating conversations and give her more space?",1549189428

ISTJ,"I have an engineering degree and a masters to switch disciplines (i.e. chem eng to mech eng). From high school until this point, I had no direction of where I want to go with my career. I went into engineering because it was more of an ego thing (dumb younger me). I'm very apprehensive about continuing with the technical route. But mind you I only did engineering consulting roles, which were not a great fit for me. I ended up going on stress leave because of the way my coworkers treated me and that it was very difficult to complete my job with how things were handled.

I'm currently in a role which combines analysis and art. I do a lot of number crunching, but the other element of the job (I would say 50-60%) involves being strategic and being conceptual and abstract. There are meetings with lawyers involved and even though I have to crunch numbers, there is a defensible side of it that I need to do. It's not my favourite at all. 

I had a talk with my boss today (ENTJ) and he mentioned to me that I really need to get the calculations to be perfect and work a lot on strategic thinking. It's a huge pressure for me considering that I had little mentoring in my previous engineering roles, so I never was able to develop strong habits properly check my work. He also wants me to develop my strategic thinking and to get better at coming up with solutions and take charge as opposed to asking for directions all the time. From what he has seen is that it is a bad sign that my colleagues need to double check my work. It is a sign that they don't trust me. To him, it should be perfect and never have to be double checked.

I understand that my boss is giving me a push and part of me wants to be a better team member, but on the other side, I am wondering if I should do a career switch to a job that is more tailored to the ISTJ personality. I heard that actuary is a very good fit.

I still don't know what to do or what direction I want to go. I know that I haven't given engineering a fair chance. But there are parts of me that are very apprehensive about my ability to be in an engineering role due to my past experiences. I know that my strengths are: Process improvement, analyzing data and working on excel. I'm a perfect worker bee and will be happy to do any work, but I get bored very fast if it becomes repetitive.

They don't like specifics so when they talk to me it appears complex and hard to follow. I usually get it after they explain it a couple of times more simply or slowly. I feel dumb and they have a condecending tone at times.

ISTJ,"Good evening

Looking for some MBTI-specific input on my current situation. Separated (in-house cohabitation) with my ISTJ husband. He can be quite 'unhealthy' - very rigid, always has to be right about everything, can't admit fault, very childish when angry, quite mean and cruel sometimes, flooded by his emotions in general (both good and bad), very little empathy for other people.

We separated due to a perceived abandonment /betrayal on my part (no cheating or anything involved - I took a job long-distance and we were hopefully going to move together and it didn't work out). Also due to him finding me overly emotional and irrational. I was angry for a very long time due to ways hes behaved that I perceive as controlling. I am probably an unhealthy INFJ!

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, just wondering what works for you in these situations. Healthy or otherwise. I want to reconcile and I'm trying to really let him take it at his own pace (he's said he will try although he keeps prevaricating). I'm struggling.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really know what will happen but I would like to try to understand, better. 

I find him very confusing sometimes as I feel like when he's emotional, he isn't this rational person at all and his words and actions don't match up, but he insists they do. Also he gaslights so the whole thing leaves me scratching my head.

&amp;#x200B;

Disclaimer - he is a lovely guy overall and I know the above comes across as harsh but its just an intense situation (separation!).

it‚Äôs hard for me to develop a serious crush because i don‚Äôt have a lot of irl friends and it‚Äôs not my thing to crush on someone that i know from online. also doesnt help that im a lesbian so the chances of me knowing a queer girl and developing a crush is generally very low. 

the only person i seriously liked (maybe even loved) was a close friend of mine in high school. she‚Äôs an ESFJ so i admired her energy and appreciated how much she took care of me since i‚Äôm usually the one that takes care of others.

So he‚Äôs been taking on projects. Starting a huge garden project. He will *endlessly* research the ins and outs on how to do things. Almost out of desperation to keep himself occupied. Have all these ideas and questions. Asks anyone and everyone for advice and information.

Now he wants to start an Alpaca farm. Scratch that an Ostrich farm. Repairing and building. Endless research. Calling people incessantly.

He does lack Fe and Ne is a weak point. I get it, I‚Äôm just now becoming aware of my own Te and am doing some work to incorporate that into my own life. I‚Äôm more considerate of *not waking people up at 5am* to express new ideas and ask even more questions.

So, long story short my ESTJ roommate was driving me nuts tonight. We were hanging out with a couple of friends, and throughout the night she was making some know-it-all comments or some comments that gave me the impression that she felt like she was superior to everyone else. Things like directly chastising other people for making mistakes in board games or trying to tell people what to do when she herself probably didn't have the best idea of what to do in a certain situation.  And there was another situation where her boyfriend and I shared blame in a mistake we made, but she made me feel like I was all to blame in that situation.

Later I introduced a new type of card game to everyone that I used to play as a kid all the time, and she proceeded to make some crass remarks about certain rules being weird and how ""this \[particular rule\] is so different from every other card game I've played - this just seems so weird to me."" To which I, at that point fed up with her attitude, snarkily replied that, ""we're just trying to have a good time here.... it's not like we're playing for money or anything high stakes, so take a fucking chill pill. Shut your mouth, play the damn game once, and deal with it."" (paraphrase, but it had that sort of tone :))

We have both accepted the fact that we are terrible at texting so we try to call instead when we can.  I had a 3rd date with her last night, a lovely bonfire on a beach, we did run into a couple of obstacles that had cut the night short and got her stressed, she also had work early morning. Compared to the first two dates we were allot less intimate, maybe this is due to being on a beach? Regardless, she did text to make sure I got back home safely which then I responded to. The one thing I admire about her personality is she is very straight forward, I am currently being left on read. I might double text if she doesn't contact me in the next 24hrs. If she told me that next time we'll do something at my end before I drove back home, the below average night shouldn't be a deal breaker right?

ISTJ,"Im [21] an ENTP with an ISTJ parent that I just dont get 90% of the time. We get into it constantly, and the other parent has to intervene. 

Today is a day I dont work or have any play scheduled. So, Im enjoying a relaxing day of nothing. The ISTJ in my life would rather me use this free day to CLEAN. Like wtf man. I cant imagine a thing I would like to do LESS. 

They tend to be condescending and make little remarks that get under my skin. [Truth is, Im better at cleaning than them. Im just cluttery and disorganised. But I keep things sanitary, esp when I clean spaces like the kitchen Im way more thorough than them. Thats why I hate doing it! It takes forever bc I do a good job] 

But to me, on a day I would love to have unstructured time to unwind, they seem irked. And once theyre irked they stay all mad until I grovel bc thats how they are. 

And I dont understand how their mind works at ALL. Theyre the complete opposite of me. Im not living here much longer, but Im tired of being stressed. 

Do any of y'all who get along with entps know how to make up for the differences? How would you explain why this person is that way? Why are they so tightly wound? Is there a way I can communicate I dont want to do the thing without pissing them off???? Is this how a normal ISTJ acts?  

Im just laid back and never hold grudges [So I dont understand why theh stay mad at me all day over a brief interaction]. I think things should be done when people want to do them. And cleaning a superficial mess is not a high priority to me, esp in the privacy of my bedroom. I will clean spaces that are public or need sanitised without complaint [unless Im extremely drained].

I can read all the descriptions, but I‚Äôs rather hear what makes you different from those descriptions. 

As an ENFP I can say, for example, that I love sports. Dancing, surfing, sailing, those things are amazing. I also love ‚Äòdoing‚Äô things. This is in contrast to the stereotype of lazy too focussed on thoughts. Of course I certainly have that element, but it doesnt define me.

I can't do that good enough, no matter how hard I try. Stressing words works to a certain degree, but my tone changes just slightly between my most passionate subject and the most boring.   
People often have no idea how I feel about something unless I find words that describe it. But finding those words is so exhausting, takes too long and I'm often misunderstood. It's really frustrating when I actually care a lot and others think I don't.

",1547039463
ISTJ,"I adore my ISTJ, however, she's a (self proclaimed) ""late bloomer"" and isn't as emotionally developed/mature as she should be at her age, so we're having some problems...

**She's really blunt**. Like REALLY blunt. To the point of being tactless and hurtful. Instead of reflecting on her own actions, she tells me that I'm overly sensitive, that she feels like she's walking on eggshells around me, and that I'm an emotional roller coaster for reacting negatively to her gnarly, flippant comments.

Example: Around New Years, we road tripped about 8 hours or so away from home. We bickered the whole way to our destination because we were both exhausted and were being obnoxious. While discussing feelings stuff, she was so exhausted and ""done"" with the conversation that she threatened to drive home alone and drop me off at the airport to fly home by myself, because ""I would have said whatever it took to end the conversation"". I was devastated and genuinely afraid of being abandoned 8 hours from home, regardless of her intention.        

**Double standards.**.. the expectations she has of me are much higher than the expectations she would have of herself in any given situation.  

Example: Her small dog is allowed to sleep in the bed, under the covers, but my dogs aren't even allowed to so much as look at the bed. She isn't willing to put the effort into retraining the small dog to sleep on the floor because it's too much work, according to her. 

**My way or the highway mentality.**.. she has a mapped out vision of what she expects her life to be like, and is unwilling to compromise on things that are important to her, regardless of how they'll affect me. 

Example: She wants a one dog household, after all of our current pups eventually pass, and she wants the dog to love her most. Problem: I have a low maintenance, household only, service dog (SD) and will likely need one for the rest of my life, thus her plan won't realistically happen. When we discussed it, she asked a million questions about how to get around me having a SD, therefore I got frustrated and told her that realistically, when the time comes, she won't get to have a say in the matter. She was upset that she couldn't have her designated life plan, and I was upset that she was tactless and insensitive about my disability and need for a SD (which she's known about for years, so I'm really lost about this one?). 

I think most of her behaviors, and ways of approaching life, have developed due to spending most of her adult life in emotionally, mentally, and financially abusive relationships. She's blunt and tactless because that's how shes been treated  by others in her past relationships, so it's the norm. She has double standards because she's always been the one to compromise her own needs to support others, and she wants someone to do that for her now. She has a my way or the highway mentality because, again, she's had to compromise so much of herself and her values to support the people she's been in relationships with, so now she expects me to do that for her. However, all of this is incredibly unhealthy and is genuinely affecting my quality of life within this relationship. 

Realistically, she needs a therapist; but in lieu of a therapist, is there anything I can do to better communicate to her how her behaviors are affecting me and wearing me down? How do I even approach these kinds of topics with someone who already has so little wherewithal for discussions about ""feelings""? Like I said, I'm an INFJ so I can discuss feelings all night and day, but I want to be sensitive to her emotional needs and not leave her feeling worn down/attach a negative association to discussing feelings.

ISTJ,"Hi fellow ISTJs. As of late I've noticed that I'm incredibly high-strung and anxious about certain areas in my life, namely my romantic life, to the point where I feel like my mental health is going down the dumps.

I recently started talking to someone online, and while we've not yet met in real life I feel like I have a real connection to him. Similar interests, sense of humor, etc. The unfortunate thing is that he's quite far away, and a long-distance thing just isn't a smart choice. However during the whole time I've been talking to him I've been feeling an overwhelming sense of anxiety about the whole situation, stemming from the fact that 1) he's far away and that we'd never be in a relationship until we somehow lived in the same city and 2) the fact that he was seeing other people in a casual setting. We had discussed this, and we both made it clear to each other that we liked each other but it was obviously a little hard that this was kind of a lost opportunity because of our distance. 

In some ways I feel like the anxiety and stress I'm deriving from this experience has really kind of sidelined me from my ""normal me"". I'm typically not a very clingy person at all, but with him it almost feels like I'm trying to cling onto something that ultimately will be fruitless. For instance, suggesting we try something long distance even though 1) we haven't met and 2) this objectively makes no sense. Or constantly trying to keep a line of communication with him so I know he's still actually likes me despite the people he's sleeping with.

I feel like all these actions are incredibly unhealthy, but I'm also at a bit of a standstill in terms of figuring out how to stop this kind of unhealthy behavior (both this time around and potentially any future people I start talking to). Does anyone have any advice surrounding this? Might not even have to do with relationships specifically. Thanks in advance :)",1546628182
ISTJ,"I don't know where to even start with this, it's mostly just a general rant with some questions and looking for advice at the end.

So I've been pursuing a career in finance/banking for awhile now, it's landed me in a retail banking position I've had for a few years now.  I enjoy the job a lot, but I'm struggling moving anywhere in this career mostly because I have trouble meeting sales goals expected of me by management.  That's not to say I'm bad at my job, I have a great reputation among all of my co-workers and customers because I can fix or find out how to fix just about any issue at my branch.  Co-worker's computer, printer, scanner not working?  Customer has fraud on their account?  Deposit posting error?  Irate customer?  General banking question?  Account history/analysis?  Drawer not balancing?  I can take care of it all because I love problem solving, and I can do it all efficiently and I always follow up with whoever I'm helping to make sure they're taken care of, my customers love me for this.

But I struggle with finding those conversations to get people to move their large deposit accounts from other banks, following up with people who need loans, or general 'sales' related stuff because I'm a worker, not a salesman.  I just want to help people with their problems and go home.  I can force myself to do the most basic sales stuff, like ask people cashing their weekly payroll check if they'd just like to open an account and maybe setup direct deposit with their employer or something, but it's really uncomfortable for me because I feel that people who want accounts with us would just open them anyways, they shouldn't have to be 'convinced'.  90% of my sales are walk-ins who were already going to open accounts regardless of what I said to them.

For awhile I searched for other banks and jobs within the company, and just had an interview for a promotion the other week, and one line I hear almost every single time is something along the lines of ""I can tell by your attitude and work history you'll go really far in this career!"" followed by some reasoning as to why I'm not being hired/promoted either immediately or days later, usually boils down to sales and experience.  I can't tell if these compliments of foreseeing my success are serious or just empty words to make me feel better at this point, apparently a lot of managers see my potential but don't want to take a chance on me.  So as for where I'm going with this....


1.  How do I get out of retail banking?  What are my options as far as staying working in finances go?

2.  My ideal job is to eventually be either an underwriter, credit analyst, or community banker/loan officer, do these jobs typically have high sales expectations too?  

3.  Is there anything I can do to suck up my dislike of sales even more and just try to make them?  What do I say, what opportunities should I be looking out for?

ISTJ,"Hello, 

I've been asking myself a lot of questions lately about a relationship. 

It has been a little over two and a half years since I met an ISTJ (diagnosed by an MBTI test, and it fits perfectly) 4 years younger than me. For my part, I test INFP, ENFP sometimes INFJ. 

As colleagues, we spent a lot of time together, even more so as over time we had the same group of friends. For several months we communicated via messenger and sms. He was charming, funny, attentive but like a friend. At the end of several evenings with friends, we usually slept together on site. It was no problem, we were friends and trusted each other. But one night, it got a little out of hand. We were attracted to each other, it was obvious. We asked ourselves some questions and decided to be together for good (even though I was reluctant for several weeks because of the age gap). 

He sent me messages almost every day, sometimes to say nothing (excuses). We met in pairs and in groups from time to time, he introduced me to his close friends. Then he yo-yoed: ""I don't know anymore"" ""did we consider ourselves a couple""... we decided to take a ""break"" during the summer holidays because he was lost, didn't know yet what he would do as a further study based on the results of competitions. I accepted against my will. 

We went on holiday with friends to Spain. During that week, he was friendly with everyone but didn't pay attention to me. It was hard. An evening at the club, I danced a lot and with tourists present. When he returned to France, he blamed me: ""I didn't recognize you"" ""it wasn't a holiday for me"". I told him it was nothing and that I didn't know how to dance with him anyway. He replied that it was just a break for him and that everything would be better when he got his apartment in September. What happened. We started again together, even more so because we had passed another milestone: we made love after 6 months of ""couple"". Everything was perfect, we met once a week at his place when he had a lot of work for the next day. I felt like we were an old couple, but it was reassuring and good. Most of the time, I would bring back food, he would cook, we would discuss our day, our worries, our plans in the coming days, we would laugh, we would watch a movie while cuddling a little. Then I slept on the spot. 

And once again, after 5-6 months, the yo-yo. He hardly answered the messages anymore or with ""yes"" and ""no"". In our group of friends, he spent more and more time with someone we knew (ENFP). I didn't know what to think anymore and didn't want to make a drama. I was trying to understand him. 

After the summer holidays of the following year, he was to leave for southern France to continue his studies. He told me he would come back often. This was the case, every 2 or 3 weeks, for his family and our group of friends. And I've been to see him three times since then, in the south, with another friend. When he came up, we spent evenings with friends and nights sleeping together only. 

The new year is coming, we are doing it with friends and it brings someone from the south as we can bring people. Only, apparently it's a girl. I don't know who she is, if she's a friend or more... 

I don't know what to think anymore... if he's tired, if he's playing, if he's trying to disappear from my life without breaking up completely just in case, if he's trying to make me jealous... 

If you have already experienced something similar, can you advise me? I try to communicate but either he's busy or he doesn't talk about emotions and says he's still there and that's the main thing. 

Is that something that ISTJs do? Are they faithful even when there is no communication? 

Please help me...

ISTJ,"Bonjour, 
Je me pose √©norm√©ment de questions ces derniers temps concernant une relation. 

 Cela fait un peu plus de deux ans et demi que j'ai rencontr√© un ISTJ (diagnostiqu√© par un test MBTI, et cela colle parfaitement) plus jeune que moi de 4 ans. Pour ma part, je teste INFP, ENFP certaines fois INFJ. 
En tant que coll√®gues, nous passions beaucoup de temps ensemble, encore plus comme au fil du temps nous avions le m√™me groupe d'amis. Pendant plusieurs mois nous avons communiquer via messenger et sms. Il √©tait charmant, dr√¥le, √† l'√©coute mais comme un ami. A la fin de plusieurs soir√©es entre amis, nous dormions ensemble sur place en g√©n√©ral. Cela ne posait pas de probl√®me, nous √©tions amis et avions confiance l'un en l'autre. Mais un soir, cela a d√©rap√© un peu. Nous √©tions attir√©s l'un par l'autre c'√©tait √©vident. Nous nous sommes pos√© des questions et avons d√©cid√© d'√™tre ensemble pour de bon (m√™me si j'√©tais r√©ticente pendant plusieurs semaines √† cause de l'√©cart d'√¢ge). 
Il m'envoyait des messages presque tous les jours, certaines fois pour ne rien dire (des pr√©textes). On se voyait √† deux et en groupe de temps en temps, il m'a pr√©sent√©e  √† ses amis proches. Puis il a fait le yo-yo : ""Je ne sais plus"" ""est ce qu'on s'est consid√©r√© comme un couple"" ... nous avons d√©cid√© de faire une ""pause"" pendant les vacances d'√©t√© parce qu'il √©tait perdu, ne savait pas encore ce qu'il ferait comme poursuite d'√©tude en fonction des r√©sultats de concours. J'ai accept√© malgr√© moi. 
Nous sommes partis en vacances entre amis en Espagne. Pendant cette semaine l√†, il √©tait amical avec tout le monde mais ne me pr√™tait pas attention. C'√©tait dur. Une soir√©e en bo√Æte, j'ai beaucoup dans√© et avec des touristes pr√©sents. En rentrant en France, il me l'a reproch√© : ""je ne te reconnaissais pas"" ""ce n'√©tait pas des vacances pour moi"". Je lui ai dit que ce n'√©tait rien et que de toute fa√ßon je ne savais plus sur quel pied danser avec lui. Il m'a r√©pondu que c'√©tait juste une pause pour lui et que tout irait mieux quand il aurait son appartement en septembre. Ce qui s'est produit. Nous avons repris ensemble, de plus belle car nous avions passer un autre cap : nous avons fait l'amour apr√®s 6 mois de ""couple"". Tout √©tait parfait, on se voyait une fois par semaine chez lui m√™me quand il avait beaucoup de travail pour le lendemain. J'avais l'impression qu'on √©tait un vieux couple, mais c'√©tait s√©curisant et bon. La plupart du temps, je ramenais de quoi manger, il cuisinait, on discutait de notre journ√©e, nos soucis, nos projets dans,les jours √† venir, on rigolait, on regardait un film tout en se c√¢linant un peu. Puis je dormais sur place. 
Et encore une fois, apr√®s 5-6 mois, le yo-yo. Il ne r√©pondait presque plus aux messages ou par ""oui"" et ""non"". Dans notre groupe d'amis, il passait de plus en plus de temps avec une de nos connaissances (ENFP). Je ne savais plus quoi penser et ne voulais pas faire de drame. J'essayais de le comprendre. 
Apr√®s les vacances d'√©t√© de l'ann√©e suivante, il devait partir dans le sud de la france pour sa poursuite d'√©tude. Il me disait qu'il reviendrait souvent. Ce qui a √©t√© le cas, toutes les 2 ou 3 semaines, pour sa famille et notre groupe d'amis. Et je suis all√©e le voir 3 fois depuis, dans le sud, avec une autre amie. Les fois o√π il remontait, nous passions des soir√©es entre amis et passions la nuit √† dormir ensemble uniquement. 
Le nouvel an approche, nous le faisons entre amis et il ram√®ne quelqu'un du sud comme nous pouvons amener des personnes. Seulement, apparemment c'est une fille. Je ne sais pas qui elle est, si c'est une amie ou plus...
Je ne sais plus du tout quoi penser ... s'il s'est lass√©, s'il joue, s'il essait de disparaitre de ma vie sans rompre compl√®tement au cas o√π, s'il essait de me rendre jalouse...
Si vous avez d√©j√† v√©cu quelque chose de similaire, pouvez vous me conseiller ? J'essaie de communiquer mais soit il est occup√© soit il ne parle pas d'√©motions et dit qu'il est encore l√† et c'est le principal.
Est ce quelque chose que font les ISTJ ? Sont ils fid√®les m√™me quand il n'y a plus de communication ?

ISTJ,"I'm dating an ENFP who does the very occasional recreational drug. I wouldn't say I grew up anti-drug but drugs were never in the realm of my consciousness. I thought only non-productive members of society did drugs, and when I say drug I'm including weed. So I never had to think about whether I can accept an SO doing drugs. And I'm finding it very hard now.

He grew up a bit in the US and his parents are very liberal. I grew up solely in Asia, both my parents are also ISTJs and I was a Psych major, did a course on substance abuse, none of my core groups of friends do any drugs or even smoke and most of them don't drink. Basically, I'm a very conservative ISTJ.

I myself won't be open to doing drugs but I'm entertaining the possibility of being able to accept an SO partaking in drugs, for the sake of maintaining this relationship.

I've done some research and talking to friends but my views on drugs are constantly being validated because DUH my friends are like me. I feel like research can go both ways - some drugs are bad, some are safe etc. and it's very much about self-control and I feel like drugs is very risky.

Has anyone ever managed to change their own minds about something that is so deep rooted that it's almost hardline and fundamentalist?",1545909377
ISTJ,"I think I'm having an existential crisis.  I'm wondering if any of you all have been through it and how you got through it?   I came across one site that described what triggers an existential crisis for each type, and it pretty much hits the nail on the head with where I am:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; **ISTJ:** facts, facts, facts, and accounting. The ISTJ is in a no man's land when it comes to creativity. **If you take out all the normal goals of getting married by a certain age, having a certain career, and retirement -- you will destroy an otherwise healthy ISTJ.** The ISTJ needs all that normal junk -- questioning them gives them an adrenaline rush of social anxiety. Don't force them outside of their world of normalcy. They need tradition, they need a sound work ethic, and they need routine. Don't shove them into a world of too much dalliance. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm at an age where I had hoped/planned to be married already.  I recently got out of an unhealthy relationship of 2 years and I'm pretty flippin cynical and jaded.  Have pretty much given up on a happy marriage being an option and have written off my entire love life until now as meaningless.  I ""made it"" in my career after a lot of hard work and... work is good.  I have a good team, I'm well respected and admired, I'm well paid, but none of it is particularly fulfilling.  It's just what I do, and if I did anything else, I would probably be as successful and unsatisfied in that field, too.  I've never been super driven by money either so that doesn't make me happier either.  Retirement?  Yeah, I'm in denial of getting old and living up to a retirement age so that's nixed.   

&amp;#x200B;

I used to have this white picket fence dream of getting married and raising my kids and blah blah and I feel like the people I dated in the last 5 years really just drilled it into me that that was never going to happen.  Yeah, my bad--no one made me stay with them, right?  I learned a lot and I've moved on.  But I really don't know how to rebuild this image of my life that I used to have.  My most recent ex used to constantly tell me, ""You can't build your dreams of the future with someone else because you can't control anyone but yourself.""  I guess it finally sunk in.  

&amp;#x200B;

By all measures, I'm doing great.  I have a really low amount of debt for my age, I'm a few months into my first career position and they already want to promote me.  They have plans for my career at the company.  I recently started seeing someone who seems very nice and stable.  It's just all marred by these intense feelings of how meaningless this all is--and I know it's because I'm stuck thinking about my past relationship failures and how no matter how hard I tried, it all fell apart anyway.  After I've written this out, I guess this kind of sounds like a Si-Fi loop?  

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I apologize for how long this got.  I'm already in therapy, but my relationship with my therapist is more of I show up with a plan of action and she guides me through it rather than she tells me what I need to do.  And I honestly just have no idea how to break through this. ",1545883389

Most traditions are illogical and dumb, yet every summary always mentions how ""tradition-bound"" I am, why and what is this? It defies logic - which is my primary characteristic. ",1545587404

ISTJ,"TL:DR Have a problem understanding the mind of my ISTJ when I'm a Feeler dating a Sensor and what it does to me.

I don't know what goes on in his mind most of the time. He only communicates when he feels like it's necessary, which is hardly ever about his feelings. I'm a very good reader of people, and I can generally follow his likes and dislikes and his outward behaviors. He jokes about me ""reading his mind"" when I reach for things he was thinking about, or I bring him an alcoholic beverage while he plays videogames. But that's just the surface, which is easy to read. The rest of his mind is like a maze in a dark dungeon. I continue to run into walls without a way of finding any source of light. 

His feelings are somewhere down there, and they bubble to the surface every once in a while if I poke and prod at the ground enough. As the first ISTJ I have ever encountered, and my strong ability to read into people's deepest parts of themselves with one meeting, I've been thrown for a loop. It's unnerving for me as I feel as what I imagine Super Man would feel to suddenly encounter kryptonite mid-flight. I try to explain my own emotions to him, my feelings about the things I experience, and the things that plague my mind, but he doesn't understand it. He'll possibly try to comfort me from time to time, but rarely does he see the problem I have tried to convey to him. I cut out my heart and splay it out on the table like a gutted fish, and instead of looking at the inside, he tells me how silly it is for me to put it out there. 

It creates anxieties I've never experienced, and heightening ones that plagued me since a young age. Trust issues are battled, and my constant need for information I feel as if I need to gather for something I'm highly interested and invested in (my SO.) 

What are your relationships with an ISTJ like, or what is it like if there is an ISTJ with an INFJ?",1545531748
ISTJ,"Tried to link to an earlier thread but didnt work out how. TL:DLR INFJ married to an ISTJ man, we are separated but still living together more or less. I hurt him through some emotional, irrational decisions which happened due to generally being quite upset. He admitted he‚Äôs still in love with me. I genuinely think I can change... just wondering how I might show him that? Other than through action and hoping over time he may come to believe it.

What needs to change is stuff where I need to grow, aiNFJ typical stuff, poor boundaries, leading to built up resentment, not communicating well re my needs etc. We are both and maybe me in particular - quite immature but it‚Äôs pretty tragic our marriage has got here where we are now when there‚Äôs so much love there on both sides.

I think I understand him a fair amount although I still find it hard that he can‚Äôt really understand me.

ISTJ,"Curious INTJ here. I've been going through some old conversations with my ex (because why not) and I still struggle in typing him, as he was a particularly unhealthy individual. My best guess right now is that he might be an ISTJ, but I've found conflicting info about unhealthy ISTJ behaviour so I figured I might just ask here and see if this rings a bell! So if you've been through an unhealthy phase or have met unhealthy ISTJs your input will be greatly appreciated - like, what would be the telltale signs that are pretty specific to ISTJs in crisis? I've been wondering for a while whether he was ISTJ or INTJ, but having been through the underdeveloped INTJ phase myself I could not find much I can relate to.  I thought of adding what I remember about him to see if you can partially relate to it:

&amp;#x200B;

\*Completely detached from other people\*: he clearly never was a particularly social person, but even dating with him was a nightmare. He claimed that going out was extremely stressful for him, even if it was just to meet me. He had two ""comfort zones"", his university and his home, and would only accept to meet people at the former - so he was ok with studying together with other people in university and we would usually hang out there as well, but most of the times he would avoid any other sort of date. Even though we were dating, I always had the impression that I didn't have much more access to him than any other of his casual acquaintances. He always tended to be cold and distanced  and would put up an excessive amount of walls. 

&amp;#x200B;

\*Extremely focused on his work\*: I would say almost obsessively. I've rarely seen him take an evening off, he would rather try and do something pleasurable while he was working at the same time so that the working could never stop. (I.e. watching putting a movie in background)

&amp;#x200B;

\*Easily angered\* by trivial stuff, even when it does not directly touch him. Once he was in a foul mood for two days because someone had accidentally written over a plastic cover he was using to keep some documents. He was extremely jealous and would snap at me if I met with friends (even when we were not supposed to meet because he needed to ""work""). He would take any comment or action as extremely personal and disrespectful (even when they weren't), and would react by being extremely offensive and dismissive of other people's point of view, or by putting in place small and petty vindictive acts. At the same time though he'd keep up a gentle and accommodating appearance with his acquaintances. 

&amp;#x200B;

\*Not a fixer\*: while dating I tried very hard to make him feel comfortable but I just found it impossible. Everything I did was wrong in some way, and he never communicated how not to make those mistakes. Apparently there was an extremely specific way to approach a certain topic with him and when I'd get it wrong he would either snap at me or fall into passive aggressiveness for ages. If I tried to address the problems in our relationship he would deny the existence of any problem except that tiny thing that I did who knows how many months before. Needless to say, he never wanted to talk about his feelings and would only express anger. For me it was incredibly frustrating as I'm a natural fixer and he would not allow me to find any solutions. 

&amp;#x200B;

\*Surprisingly (at least for me) illogical in to arguments\*: even though he wanted to present his point of view as logical and distanced, he would blatantly omit certain details that could prove him wrong and his thinking was just flawed. Fighting with him was just like arguing with a deaf person - he would not even reply to me, he'd just keep going with his internal monologue. 

&amp;#x200B;

\*Since I read a lot of you mentioning ""neediness"" in previous threads\*: I always had the opposite impression about him, but he did have a need to be in constant communication with me when we were not together. At times I also felt like he wanted a bit too much from me (like defend him against other people publicly if he was in a fight), but still don't think he was particularly needy. 

&amp;#x200B;

Very curious about your impressions. I know a lot of the stuff I listed is more related to his being unhealthy rather than possibly ISTJ, but I was hoping you could spot the typing signs in there!",1545405428

-Nurse but works more in legal

-Likes cheesy girl comedies although hard to get her to stop cleaning and relax.

ISTJ,"I'm a 27 year old female and single. I'd say I'm at least average or slightly above. I really only interact with the opposite sex at work. I actually have a crush on a co-worker but he's got a girlfriend. Any other guy I may like, I worry about us working together. I don't have a large friend pool. Maybe one person I hang out with regularly. I've downloaded 2 dating apps but haven't really mustered up the courage to use them again. A few years ago I went on a Tinder date and we ended up talking/hanging out for about a month before he said ""I don't do relationships"". 

The reason I haven't tried again is the fact that I totally over-analyze everything and each swipe is like life or death to me. I take it way too seriously. Whenever I get a match, it's exciting but I'm like oh shit what now? I'm pretty good at being entertaining/flirty over text. But I get anxiety at the thought of meeting up. What if I don't meet his expectations? What will we talk about? Is he going to play me? What if he's an axe murderer? Ideally, I would just make friends with a guy and have it grow from there but I'm also kind of impatient about it. 

Does anyone else feel the same? What's your approach to dating? I've been told I'm very hard to read so it must be hard for someone interested in me. ",1545317227

They are some of the most hard-working students in my university and I am glad that you guys are able to bring me down to earth.

That being said, as an INFP guy, what should I do to make an ISTJ woman happy? What gifts or type of dates do you guys typically like? I understand that not all ISTJs are the same, but I would like to pleasantly surprise her and identify an overlapping pattern. She considers me kind of an adorable dork, but I hear a lot that INFPs weigh or wear ISTJ down easily and I don't want to be a burden to her. Lastly, what flaws do you typically find in INFPs and what do you think works out between two almost completely opposite personality types?

Muted emotions as an ISTJ are great when you can view the world through a logical lens and tough times don't seem so tough because of tangible facts and figures.  In terms of positive emotions though, it is quite limiting.  I feel like the ""connections"" I form with people are often lacking, and I am unsure of my ability to form TRUE connections that other types might find easier to make.  ",1544941614
ISTJ,"Lots of ISTJs, and well SJs in general report fear of moving to different states, but I found it easy to move from OK to AZ. One bank person told me I was brave for moving, and I thought that was weird. Moving isn't scary for me at all, and I usually get worked up over uncertainty. But maybe that was because it was college, and I didn't need to look for a job once I got there. Tbh, if I were to move after college, I would look for a job before actually moving.

ISTJ,"I've been dating my GF, and ENFJ, for about 8 months. We're by far the most opposite of any girl I've dated, which should be pretty obvious just by our MBTI being nearly polar opposite. A lot of this I actually have grown to like. 

However, a couple of things I feel will cause major problems if/when we ever move in. The biggest one is that she lets her place get really messy before she cleans it. Like to the point where you can't see her floor. Now she does clean it once every week or two, and she like deep cleans her place. I, on the other hand, keep my place pretty clean. I'm not OCD about it, but I don't leave dishes on the table or even in the sink, don't leave my clothes on the floor etc. 

The other one is that she is fairly spiritual. She says she identifies as a Christian, but also believes in evil spirits and all that. For instance, she keeps crystals above every door and window seal to ""keep out the bad spirits."" I'm not religious myself, but I don't have a huge problem with Christian women, as long as they're not dogmatic etc. 

Is there some way to reconcile these things? I've really tried to figure out the cleaning thing, because that would be the thing that drives me crazy. When I used to live at home, my sister kept her room the same way, but she never cleaned it until we made her. She tells me I'm too uptight and rigid when it comes to the cleaning issue, because I won't just get up and leave dishes on the table after eating etc, but I think that's rather normal? The majority of people's houses I've been to don't live like that honestly. 

Does anyone else experience problems like this with their SO? I've had disagreemens before with SOs, but this girl has a lot of qualities that I like, so I'd rather find a way to get over these things. ",1544861406
ISTJ,"I am an ISTJ, 27 y/o. I finished my bachelor degree and 2 masters, all very theoretical subjects (8 years in total). It was a mistake but I understand it only now. As fellow ISTJs, you must understand my struggles. With time I find it more an more useless, tiring an uninteresting to work with theory and this kills my chances to do a PhD. I shiver from fear when I think that if I do my PhD, I'll have to deal with this painful, bullshit theory for 3 more years. Now I wish so bad I had studied something more practical, something I can touch with my hands, carry out experiments in the lab (for example, biology), or see things on the screen (for example, air-traffic control), but it is too late now. I cannot go back in time and change my educational path. Plus, I believe it is too late now to start new studies, I'm not a teenager anymore. Also, people around me expect that I must be working full time or doing PhD an that puts a lot of stress on me. At the moment it is really difficult because I moved to a foreign country (with different language) and finding a full time job is very challenging. 
I feel incredibly stuck, I am surrounded by a bitter feeling of regret, mourning over the carrier I could have had if I had chosen my studies carefully, pain over the fact that it cannot be changed, and unambiguous future. I feel like crying as I am typing this.

What I thought would be a nice Meetup turned into an entire day and a half together roaming the city, her showing me around, taking occaisional breaks to re-charge, and just generally enjoy the company with each other. Waking up next to her was so wonderful (and unexpected tbh) It just felt so real compared to any other person I've been with.

She came *so far* out of her shell in order to show me a good time. Of course we had our awkward moments, but that's to be expected! And to be honest, seeing her and having this experience has helped me to work out a lot of personal situations I've been overcomplicating. 

Truthfully it hit me on a spiritual level I don't really feel often. And I don't know exactly how to convey my appreciation to her... For how much effort she put in, for how she made me feel... just all of it.

ISTJ,"Enfp here.

He is having off days. Cognition is in decline and full blown dementia looms overhead. Physical ailments. Medications and side effects. 

I‚Äôve also observed him being in the grip of Ne (stressful last few years, people badgering him not noticing he *needs to take off his dutiful hat* and just live life in peace.) Without demands. 

When he spends an afternoon tending to said demands he gets incoherent, confused, his memory becomes jumbled and he‚Äôs uncoordinated. 
He can suddenly become annoyed. 

He‚Äôll fixate on several ideas, and get obsessed over researching details about said ideas. Spend money seeing some through. It all looks more reactionary than pursuing something out of enjoyment.

I‚Äôm noticing every nuance of this now. So I can see the triggers clearly. Ne is not just about bubbly ideas. It‚Äôs an astute little fucker. 

My mother isn‚Äôt very astute nor very nurturing. Quite the opposite she‚Äôs been a bit mean spirited and annoyed by him. Rather than everyone taking an objective step back and tending to the many facets of this situation... they‚Äôre either ignoring it ‚Äúbecause it‚Äôs too painful to take‚Äù, have their heads stuck up their asses blinded by their demands of him, or are just too rigid with him. I mention this not to complain or place blame, just to illustrate that he hasn‚Äôt been relieved of stress or subtly had responsibility lifted from his shoulders. 

I‚Äôve decided to move in and be by his side. To help steer ideas toward one grounded project, to ease the anxieties that seem to come with incessantly researching details with a different perspective, make sure he‚Äôs on a better diet, not driving, etc etc 

how can I approach the more technical side of things. He still has days where he is fine and wants full control of things. It hasn‚Äôt sunken in that he‚Äôs forgetting to pay bills. That he‚Äôs using his credit card *way too much*. That property he‚Äôs renting out needs someone else to watch over. 

I am private with his matters, I‚Äôm discreet with personal things. I act as a buffer between him and bullshit with others. I try to have everyone keep an objective and humanistic perspective. 

I troubleshoot fairly quickly and most days he gets it. Some days he‚Äôs adamant because he can‚Äôt wrap his head around my approach. Lol in the end we always reach the same conclusion. He will then understand what I was trying to do. (Vice versa all our lives there are lapses in between *you were right!* with our perspectives).

I‚Äôm also aware with ISTJs competency is key. I have to be trusted with certain matters. 

All this said and done- 

How should I go about taking care of him and basically making sure the technicalities and responsibilities are also tended to. He still wants control and...soon he won‚Äôt be able to because of his cognition. 

Apologies for how I‚Äôve presented this. I haven‚Äôt discussed this out loud yet so it‚Äôs quite scattered. I‚Äôm still wrapping my head around it to find a systematic approach to it whilst making him feel comfortable and sane. 

But there‚Äôs some background for you.

I'm a female late 20s ENTP trying to figure out how to get along with my 50-something ISTJ MIL. We are around each other quite a bit and it's important for me to have a good relationship with her. We don't not get along, but we also aren't exactly....friends?

She never seemed interested in really getting to know me while in the dating stages with her son.

She's very generous and a good provider, but still don't get a warm feeling. She does a lot of VERY generous things for my husband and I but I just don't feel close or bonded with her, idk. She says I'm unique and different to her and will say this in front of me and other people, which...I don't really know how to take lol. I try to view it positively but...I don't feel we're close enough to appreciate each other that way yet?

Our conversations are...at least to me, very awkward and feel forced. Lots of awkward silence. I'm normally great with getting to know people and keep conversation going, but with her I struggle really bad and am often met with a cringe type smile and nodding for more than I am comfortable with. Like I'll say something like ""Me and Husband went to Event and thought you'd like it"" to which she'll smile and nod, no response. Idk what to do in those situations cause she just keeps staring at me LOL, is this an ISTJ thing or...?

My husband says that's just the way she is and that if she didn't like me, she would have told him a long time ago. So at this point I accept we're just different and want to focus on our similarities to make everything smoother and not feel anxious when left alone with her.

So how can I, as an ENTP, get along better with her? What can you tell me about being an ISTJ that would help me understand her better? It seems like we butt heads a lot and have a disagreeable relationship and I really want to improve it.

ISTJ,"Hi everyone! [22F] ENFJ here, been seeing [23M] ISTJ for two months now. It wouldn‚Äôt have made it to 2 months if y‚Äôall didn‚Äôt give some insight into the ISTJ mind when we first began. 

My ISTJ, despite being as quiet and reserved as he is, came to my Thanksgiving celebration this year. We hadn‚Äôt seen each other in 2 weeks because he was busy with work and then got sick, and my anxiety began convincing me he was fading out on me. 

He came! I hosted Thanksgiving for everyone I knew who would not be celebrating with their families. I‚Äôm in grad school so a lot of us couldn‚Äôt afford to fly home. I also work I retail so a few of us couldn‚Äôt go home and make it back in time for Black Friday. This was his first thanksgiving away from home and I‚Äôm so glad he chose to spend it with me and my friends.

I was so glad he came. He knew there would be 15 people there and he wouldn‚Äôt know anyone there but me. He showed up! Met all of my friends, my roommate, and more important people in my life. I was so warm and fuzzy at the end of the night :)

**So now for some insight:**
1. Am I thinking too much? 

Did he come so he wouldn‚Äôt do thanksgiving alone or came because he likes me? I‚Äôve been pretty clear in letting him know how much I like him but also trying to keep my cool so as to not chase him away. We have not DTR‚Äôd yet. I‚Äôm in no rush, but am hoping to discuss being exclusive (I think it‚Äôs been implied, I just want to put words to it)

2. My birthday was on Sunday. 

He knew I was going away specifically for my birthday and he didn‚Äôt wish me a happy birthday. At thanksgiving, we had a cake and everyone sang happy birthday, but when I glanced over at him he was expression-less and never wished me happy birthday later. Not that it‚Äôs a big deal, I just get anxious about things like that and start thinking bad thoughts like ‚Äúhe didn‚Äôt wish me hbd because he doesn‚Äôt like me‚Äù irrational, but that‚Äôs what anxiety is, isn‚Äôt it?

3. He takes so long to text me back. 

I sent him the details about thanksgiving last Friday and he didn‚Äôt respond to me until Monday, then on Wednesday asked for all the info (address, time) again. On thanksgiving I walked him to his car and asked if he‚Äôd be free Saturday because I wanted to see him again and spend some one on one time and he said maybe, he‚Äôll see. I texted him yesterday at 10pm when I got off my Black Friday shift (THE WORST) asking if he‚Äôs free today and letting him know I was besides getting some school work done. It‚Äôs almost noon here and haven‚Äôt heard back. The anxiety is kicking back in where I‚Äôm like ‚Äúdo I cut my losses??‚Äù

I‚Äôm a planner. I like scheduling friends, events, etc weeks in advance. The fact that he doesn‚Äôt get back to me quickly makes me think he‚Äôs ignoring me and it makes me sad. I know that‚Äôs not the case. I know he‚Äôs busy and getting things done and doesn‚Äôt sit on his phone like I do. How do I communicate this across? Like I said, we‚Äôve been seeing each other and have been intimate, but have not DTR‚Äôd. My biggest fear in general is being too needy.

To preface this I'm an ISFJ and I know a lot of xSTJs. Not as many ISTJs, but the ones I do know are great to talk to. I think that my coworker is more awkward than most and that's why it's so confusing.


From what I've noticed there's a sort of switch; she'll either be in the mood for small talk (in which case she's easy to talk to) or she'll respond to things with straightforward &amp; curt answers. My go-to way of communicating with her right now is to ask a question. If she elaborates, I assume she's in the mood to talk. If she doesn't, I take the cue and work quietly. 


If she sees me struggling with something, she'll laugh at/with(???) me and then help. She can come across as a bit harsh, but I think she's genuinely trying to be nice; she tries to smile (could potentially be a smirk) when I apologize and while I try not to bother her and ask for help, she doesn't seem to mind when I do.

ISTJ,"This is more of a career advice kind of post.

&amp;#x200B;

So at work, I feel that one of my biggest weaknesses is proactively thinking about how to make things better. For example ideas like ""how to automate systems"" or ""how to make the on-call experience less stressful"" are suggested by my coworkers, but I feel that I'm never the one to really come up with these ideas. In fact, I don't really find issues with the status quo because I feel like I'm not one to so-called 'complain' about what exactly is bad about the status quo. I can simply adapt without major issues unless it's an issue I really can't overlook. I'm fairly junior on my team (just over a year out of college), so I don't think these kinds of things are 100% expected out of me, but as time passes I think it's more important for me to be more cognizant of these sorts of things. 

&amp;#x200B;

Outside of this, I'm a really quick worker that finishes things probably a fair amount quicker than most people on my team. But I don't think that I should be reliant on simply this for career growth. Even my manager has mentioned that I should start thinking bigger picture with respect to our team's product, especially since I've proven now that I can actually **do** things.

I am not sure if this is an ISTJ-specific issue, but I imagine dominant Si users can be prone to this. Does anyone have advice on how to become more proactive and ""improvements-oriented""?",1542160955

ISTJ,"I‚Äôm in my 3rd year at college and don‚Äôt do homework. My grades pull through because I just happen to be good at exams, but I‚Äôm concerned that I have no motivation to do homework at all. I realize that it‚Äôs probably for these reasons:
1) It‚Äôs boring.
2) I don‚Äôt view homework as a test of my skills (which I love, because I enjoy exams believe it or not) but rather a time sink.
3) Doing my homework is an obligation only to myself. If it‚Äôs a group project or something I work my ass off and generally need to lead the group so they actually work. But since not doing homework only lets myself down, my morality allows it.
If any of those three aren‚Äôt true, I‚Äôd have no problem. But unfortunately, homework is almost always all three. Like I said earlier, my test scores pull me through to pass for now, but not doing homework still hurts my grades. Any tips on motivation for ISTJs?

Having just in the last fifteen minutes googled 'how to spot an ISTJ,' I'm not entirely sure. I wouldn't 100% make the assumption as to how his mind works. I was hoping I could get some advice from the experts.

I know he's stubborn and likes to plan thing all the time, which fits the internet's criteria. I've definitely narrowed down the I and T for sure...

As an INTP I sometimes have trouble reading people. Are there any more sure-fire ways to interpret the specific functions? What should I look out for?",1541545252
ISTJ,"Not sure if anyone else really struggles with this, but at this point, it's really starting to affect my professional life.I have a really hard time starting on things that I do not want to do, especially things dealing with college. 

A little bit of background, I fell into some really deep depression and anxiety in my junior year after a family member passed away during finals week. I did mostly ok that semester: finished my work, took my tests, gave my presentations. The thing that most struck me though, I remember, was a presentation I gave for one of my classes that counted for a significant part of my grade. I was tired, I'd thrown the powerpoint together maybe two hours before. But I gave a flawless presentation from what everyone said and from what I remember (I zoned out for most of it). The professor gave me a 90. Flawless, except for one thing: I didn't speak loud enough.  I had warned everyone before I couldn't speak too loud as I was sick (spending a week in a state of emotional disarray can contribute to a lowered immune system, who knew!) and my professor knew of my situation. Yet, the way she phrased it one the rubric, *""I know you're having family issues at the moment, but you should not let that affect your presence when presenting,""* really got under my skin. That was the ONLY thing she took off for. I remember calling my mom after class and crying and lamenting to her about what had happened.

I don't know. I've never been one to give 100% percent on most anything as I will get too stressed and overwhelmed. Giving what I can has always earned me good enough grades. I'm a perfectionist, half-assed is usually still pretty good. But the way that presentation when down, something I was under pressure to do in a very limited amount of time, I feel like it flipped off some switch in my brain. After that, I could not bring myself to do any more schoolwork. My grades slipped, but I hobbled through. My procrastination became worse than ever. I would wait until the DAY OF and then attempt to research and write a 10+ page paper, all while sobbing. And then I'd just end up turning in something half finished because I couldn't bring myself to spend another minute working.

Flash forward a bit, I'm now a 6th (going on 7th) year senior who has been in and out of classes and dropped out of more than I'm proud of. I've changed my degree track just so that I could avoid taking more classes and get out with the dumb paper. I resent college more than I can even express. I'm in my final 'class,' which is a pass/fail class that determines if I'm eligible to exit my program. I've had since August to work on my portfolio and I just turned in another half-finished thing. As it's a website, I plan on finishing the last things tonight and updating it before I turn in the hard copy tomorrow. But that's only if I can bring myself to overcome my procrastination and actually do the work I need to. I have NO idea what I'm going to do during the presentation and I'm very worried I'm going to fail again and have to go through all of this AGAIN.

Does anyone else struggle with this type of disruptive procrastination? Sure, I can procrastinate on other things, but nothing as bad as school work. I have a lot of pressure from my parents to finish college too. I'm so sick of it all. Any recommendations/ideas to help me get over myself and get to work would be greatly appreciated.",1541540240

ISTJ,"FYI I also have ADHD, so that could be why I do this.

Does anyone else talk to themselves a lot (especially out loud, like when you're alone in your apartment)? I will occasionally come up with wild scenarios about injustices that might happen to me with being punished or accused of doing X, and how I would argue against them, working myself up over nothing. Sometimes these scenarios are maybe realistically possible if I were to get into an argument with a certain person, but they usually aren't, since you can never really predict how someone will respond to something; and I just caught myself talking to my myself (and writing ""myself twice in succession right there) for the past 10-15 minutes, arguing in my head and out loud against something that is literally impossible (and by the way, I don't think any of my scenarios has ever come true), and it all started from one random thought (which was actually positive/fun in this case). I do think this could be from ADHD, though, like I said.

Does anyone else do anything similar, like worrying about this impossible worst-case scenario stuff (perhaps when you've recently gotten in an argument with someone, or have a lot on your mind)? Like, do these hypothetical situations bug you occasionally? And do you talk to yourself a lot and work out things/rationalize them that way? I do that anyway, whether it's about something good or about something bad.

When I checked (briefly), I found a lot of posts in the INTJ subreddit about talking to yourself, so that's why I'm wondering this, but I'm always typed as ISTJ (but usually just 1% away from being INTJ), and even though I relate to both, I have always accepted that I'm ISTJ. I don't really care which one I could be said to be (because apparently MBTI and such is a big load anyway), but I'm just more interested in knowing if there are other ISTJs who do things like this. Obviously there's a lot more to my personality than this, but I guess if you feel like just chiming in to say ""yeah, you're probably INTJ"" I won't mind.

A. don't provide context or an understanding of how things work, making it difficult to judge whether it agrees with my own reason and common sense.

or

B. only dive into an area of personal finance and elaborate on that, meaning I'd have no context or know what the jargon being used is or means in addition to having to read many books full of information I'm not going to remember which means spending a massive amount of time energy, and effort, and that doesn't follow the Pareto principle nor would it be practical.

I don't even know what a credit card is, yet alone things like a 401K, so you can imagine how overwhelming and confusing it is to have tons of financial jargon thrown at me.

I don't want to do what many people do and figure it out as I go. That's how big mistakes are made that significantly reduces the positive outcome.

I have taken the test and have received ISTJ to ENTP. My BF is INFP and he said I am a darkside ISTJ like frank tj mackey tom cruise in Magnolia. ISTJ I met are not this much like me. What do you think?",1539812940

How could I try to think in that domain more?  I generally am terrible with Si because I want to do whatever entertains me, and I find it terribly hard to build a routine and manage my time.  Fi is completely alien to me - I tend to detach from it - it usually feels dissatisfactory for me to value something / make an ethical claim without critical Ti reasoning for why it will be beneficial.

ISTJ,"I am kind of halfway of moving on from him but I am just curious about whether he is an ISTJ or not. So, here is the list of his behaviour.

* Is introverted like me but likes hanging out with people he considers himself close to. On hanging out though, he will not speak much but will observe everything closely. I, on the other hand, don't even feel like hanging out with close friends at times and I will prefer having alone time but this is not the case for him. He also respects commitments a lot. If he has told a friend he will come to a get-together, he will definitely go.
* Looked right through my happy-go-lucky personality that i show everyone and was very fascinated by the depth of the typical INFP character. He used to tell me that I was the only person he could listen to talk and talk and never get bored listening to.
* Is incredibly intelligent and has a very good memory of everything. He remembers lines from movies, remembered everything i said or texted him ( I myself hardly remembered what i said) and could also connect things together very nicely. Also, an incredibly good sense of direction (I am terrible at that) ; I generally talked while he would guide us to new places and then somehow know the way back.
* Is also very hard-working. He never complained about doing work and he loved studying and could work till very late at night.
* Very punctual and organised. He started projects on the day itself they were assigned even if deadlines are far away and never ever procrastinated, contrarily to me. He also finished much earlier than the deadlines. Also, he always is punctual and takes lateness as a sign of disrespect though during our relationship, he kind of took it well and made jokes about it. ( I only was late by 15 min)
* Never gives up on anything he sets his mind to. I always found that fascinating. I had him in the friendzone for 1.5 years before dating him and he always flirted with me (in an awkward way) when we texted in the friendzone days. We did not have much contact though then. But he liked me a lot, so he never gave up.
* Does not feel much for other people. I always felt bad and deeply for people who are sad or are suffering and poor. He always changed topics or said that people are poor because they don't work. Always so rational.(My opinion was people are unfairly born into this poverty in comparison to other rich people and are not to be blamed).
* Has also a very black and white view of the world. He could appear very judgmental when faced to some gossip about someone and will now have a fixed opinion of this person in the same negative light that was brought to them. I am more likely to think that this is not the whole story to that person.
* Also, there is this dark side where if he was hurt, he would hurt you back relentlessly and get back at you in any way. There would be this coldness appearing from nowhere from such a seemingly so rational and in control person and it surprised me a lot.

She also has, from my perspective, a smug ""I know I'm right."" or smug ""You're wrong."" attitude when she doesn't like something or it seems ridiculous to her. An example of this is diet and PC language.

Uggh. I hate smugness, especially when the person doesn't see or is insecure about admitting they're wrong. It makes me want to say ""Grow the f*ck up you little b!tch!"" I know compassion is the answer, but that's very triggering for me.

I have read about cognitive functions, and I have read that Si is not memory. Even then, it seems rare to find an ISTJ on these forums that does not have at least a somewhat excellent memory.

So I have some questions for you ISTJs: could it be that I am taking my memory and Si for granted (and my perception is faulty), or are those ISTJs with excellent memory exceptions? Are there any ISTJs here that would agree to having an average or even poor memory? Any answer is appreciated, especially those who really understand Si and memory.

But it has also put me into a disadvantage because there was time that when my coworkers asked if someone knew the name of a certain person from a different office. I met that person once and remembered his full name. So when they asked, of course, I answered it. But they took it the wrong way and are now teasing me that I am interested in him, which is definitely not true. I just remembered it, that's all.

ISTJ,"So there's this ISTJ guy I know who I think is pretty nice. I'm an INFP and sometimes I wonder if I'm bothering him. As soon as I think of that I tell myself to not assume things. For a while of interacting with him I realized assuming things isn't so good. He never ignores my texts. One time we called and he told me he really appreciated me talking to him and that his self esteem felt better. I think that's a good thing right? I would text him and mostly avoid stuff about emotions. My friends and I talk it out and I think he doesn't feel too close to me yet. I'm totally open to talking about emotions though.

 One time he told me he got pissed at a guy for no reason, but he only felt it and it never appeared outside. I felt sad for a while thinking about all my thinker friends who told me similar things. What does it feel like to only feel it on the inside? Plus he smiles all the time. One day he said he had to get off his train and stop texting me. I told him to get home safe with exclamation marks. I like to make my emotions apparent, or so I think. He thanked me for the first time.

He gives me a lot of advice. I find it funny and weird how I'm trying to compliment him, but he doesn't get what I'm trying to say. Then he gives me more advice. I want to bond with him more. Are there ways for me to say things for him to understand? When I get too metaphorical or use emotional terms, he does not fully understand. Thanks!",1539140026

When I see this person, they don't really say ""hi"" or wave, they just look at me. I've tried smiling at them since we've had several interactions before. I've talked to him and he's laughed at some of my jokes a bunch of times, so I would think we're on friendly terms. The past couple of weeks every time I enter the room, they kind of just stare at me and say nothing. I've gotten tired of smiling or waving when I see him, or being the first to initiate ""how are you?"" so I just stare back when he looks at me and raise my eyebrows in question. No response so I ignore them as they've been doing me. 

When I am talking to other people, he passes by and talks to them but completely ignores me. Which is baffling to me because I admire this person's work ethic but it seems they just loathe me for no reason. I think I am bothered because I thought we were starting a friendship but it seems that's not the case. I feel like I am constantly getting glared at and I haven't even done anything.

I'm an ENFJ. Even though I'm pretty busy during the week, I still make time to check in with or text the people I care about. I like chatting and keeping in contact with people.

My ISTJ is quite difficult to talk to when we're not in person. I know he's very busy, but I see it as that I'm also busy but make time? I feel like I'm always texting him first, sending him messages throughout the day, letting him know I'm thinking of him. When we first started talking (met online) he was great at getting back to me right away and would occasionally text me in the morning.

My question. After we made it pretty clear we 're into each other (our last date, last weekend), I feel like he's hardly texting me. I've initiated every conversation we've had this week and am trying to coordinate a date night this weekend, but I feel like I'm pulling teeth. My dad is an ESTJ, and I know that he's the type to ""care from a distance."" Is this what's going on here? Or is he losing interest?

Furthermore, do you ISTJs get annoyed at a ""Hope you have a good day!"" or ""How was your day"" text? I feel like I'm always asking how his day is (he doesn't  give me many conversation starters to work with) and I don't want to be annoying or worse, predictable.

I would love some insight into the ISTx brain because it's such a foreign world to this bubbly, chatty, ENFJ.

Tldr; Is silence a sign of being comfortable? Is this a good thing that he's not texting as much as he was? Am I annoying when I'm trying to show I care? How do you like to keep in contact with someone you can only see in person 1-2x a week?",1538621282

I work with an ISTJ that I have seniority over, and so it falls to me to teach him how to do things a lot of the time. He's a bit of a slow learner, but also has a bit of an ego.

I went on a first date last night with who I am pretty certain is an ISTJ (might be ESTJ?) after meeting on a dating app.

The whole time he (23M) was quite reserved but chatting and conversation flowed smoothly. I liked him, but couldn‚Äôt quite tell if he liked me. I figured he did because the conversation didn‚Äôt have many awkward pauses and the whole date lasted about two hours (dinner and drinks).

So. He pays. I offer to split it but he insists because ‚ÄúI was 30 minutes late.. you can get it next time.‚Äù He felt really bad that he was so late. It was clear it flustered him a bit.

We get ready to leave and I call an Uber. He waits with me so I think all is well? But I‚Äôve had dates before that went just like this only to later never hear from them again. I decide to ask, ‚ÄúSo what do you think? Would you like to hang out again? I would.‚Äù He replies that yes, he would and brings up getting sushi next (which I am 1000% for).

We go separate ways and I text him to let him know I got home safely, and we made small talk before going to bed.

Today I text him around noon to see how his day is and we‚Äôve been texting periodically throughout the day. He‚Äôs not great at texting back immediately, and also his texts are a bit... dry. Very reserved.

Anyways. Do I wait for him to bring up our next date? Or do I take the reigns and ask him about it? I pretty much asked him on our first date and we worked together to find a plan B (my idea got rained out)

I understand years of such abuse can fuck a person up. As an ISTJ, I find it very difficult to understand why she can't not give a fuck. I used an internet troll analogy to explain it to her (e.g., ""you wouldn't let a random troll ruin your day and make you feel fucking terrible, so see your mother like an internet troll."" Didn't work.

When her parents spew offensive bullshit from their mouths, I find her dwelling on it and beating herself up; self-defeating thoughts arise from out of nowhere. 

I've stopped all forms of ""don't dwell, move on, and just don't give a fuck"" advice after she's expressed dissatisfaction over it. To me, it's like, ""The solution is right here: don't give a fuck, don't let it affect you this much! Why can't you just do it?"" 

Tonight, she plunged to that mood again after her mother insulted her looks. She asked me for alone time, said, ""we're very incompatible sometimes"". As in, we're incompatible when she gets in this mood. See, recently me trying to support her just ends up with us getting tired and pissed at each other so obviously that doesn't help anybody.

So... I, unsure what to do, just gave her the alone time she asked for. She said, ""Nothing, just relax and let me handle myself"". I've decided to just put faith in her.

It can be over things as mundane as food. For example she thinks that I should eat Food A regularly everyday because it is the 'best' food. I tried reasoning with her (alot of people also eat Food B/C/D, Has science proven that A is the best food? It is boring to eat the same food everyday etc.)

ISTJ,"Quick recap. He‚Äôs an ISTJ and I‚Äôm an ENFP. We met in January of this year and fell head over heels for each other immediately. We were exclusive after our first date and due to a happy circumstance, we moved in together by the end of the month. We both agree we‚Äôve never felt love like this before and were looking at engagement rings in February. The only problem? We would fight pretty frequently - about once every two weeks - and many of the fights went way too far. 

&amp;#x200B;

The fights went too far because of me. I completely admit this. I was way too easily influenced by my emotions and would become a different person the second I felt slighted/threatened/abandoned - leading to many tumultuous arguments that never should have happened. I‚Äôm talking slamming the door, me ‚Äúsleeping on the couch‚Äù to get away from him when we both knew I wanted to be near him, not listening to a word he says despite him making a ton of sense‚Ä¶ pretty embarrassing stuff. The good part was that we would always discuss right after the fight and each time I would very quickly come to the realization that I was wrong and apologize. 

&amp;#x200B;

It started with me having to wait until the next day, but a few months into the relationship I was able to stop myself mid-fight and say ‚ÄúI think I am overreacting and not acting myself right now, I think you are right and I am being too much, I‚Äôm sorry‚Äù. This man helped me realize that for so long (like for my entire life) I have been acting out of fear, and my go-to defense mechanism was to become extremely defensive and dismissive. By talking it through with him and reading a ton about, I discovered I‚Äôve been living life run by my ego - and I have now gotten to the point where I can proudly say I have a grasp on my emotions 90% of the time. I am no longer afraid to admit when I am wrong, which is something I could never do before. I can stop myself from getting upset in a discussion, I can calm myself down when I hear my voice getting high, and lately I can even prevent arguments from even happening in the first place. 

&amp;#x200B;

Throughout our relationship, we have almost broken up at least 6 times. Each time it was due to my bad behavior and he would say to me ‚ÄúI love you like I‚Äôve never loved anything in my life, but this is too much for me - I don‚Äôt see how we can have a happy life together fighting like this‚Äù. And each time, we would get back together - because we love each other so much and we thought we could find solutions to make it work (things like me saying when I need a pause, admitting when I'm not making sense, etc). Many of these things have worked and I've improved my ability to remain reasonable and relevant IMMENSELY. But there's still been times where I lose myself again. And the worst part is he doesn‚Äôt just ‚Äúdislike‚Äù when I‚Äôm in these moods or having these reactions - he literally hates it. 

&amp;#x200B;

We are currently broken up at the moment - it has been 2 whole weeks so it‚Äôs the longest and most official to-date. We live together and are still extremely couple-y and affectionate. He initiated the break up but only because he doesn‚Äôt see how we can possibly work. He still stares into my eyes and tells me he loves me, he still wants to spend time with me and travel with me and maintain our upcoming plans - the dude still loves me, I can feel it. But he‚Äôs convinced I‚Äôll never been able to completely stop having bad reactions. He is convinced it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm an N and he‚Äôs an S. He is positive that my shit reactions are an N thing - whereas I am convinced they‚Äôre simply me having shit reactions, due to not having a good parenting examples growing up and being slightly immature as far as relationships go. This is the first time I‚Äôm acting like a grown up in a relationship and while I am learning, it has taken some time.  

&amp;#x200B;

I don‚Äôt blame him for having doubts. I‚Äôve said it will stop many times and while it HAS improved immensely, it‚Äôs not completely gone - so in that sense, I can see why he doubts it will ever change. Though I should note that on multiple occasions he's turned to me with the biggest smile and said ‚Äúyou impress me so much with how well you just handled that‚Äù over circumstances where the old me would have been a little brat but I stayed calm and relative. He's also said to me on many occasions that if we could get past this, if I could stay calm and reasonable always, he would marry me on the spot. It's for this reason that I am refusing to give up on this relationship.... we have something really special here.

&amp;#x200B;

Here‚Äôs my question: How can I regain trust with him? What can I possibly say to him to give us another chance? I don‚Äôt blame him for not being confident‚Ä¶ I wouldn‚Äôt be either. But the amount of progress I have made is substantial, and it‚Äôs not just for him! I hate that I turn into a different person sometimes and fixing this is huge to me - and the fact that he has helped me identify the problem and solve it means the world to me, as this has been an issue with relationships and friendships in my past as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

I love this man and I believe he is my person. I don‚Äôt want to lose him. 

What can I say, what can I do? We‚Äôre discussing tonight but I‚Äôm afraid his mind is firmly made up. ",1536679448

ISTJ,"Hey you beautiful people! Im a 21 year old ENTP in need!  


I'll try to keep this as short and concise and possible. So!  


About a year ago I started talking with this ISTJ female, we've known who eachother are since like 7-8 years old, we went to the same school etc. She hit me up, and we started seeing eachother and went on dates and all that fun stuff, however, the communication was very off and it felt like we lived on 2 different planets. I decided to end it (not so graciously) and told her never to contact me again and we split up.   


About a month ago, she started communicating with me again, and seeing as how round 1 went, I've been a bit careful about it.   


We've been talking back and forth daily for like 25 days, she's been very open (which i know you guys don't like) and she's in kind of a bad place right now, I suspect depression.   


For the last week she's been completely silent, went 3 days not saying a word to eachother. I mentioned this to her, asking if something was wrong or off, and she told me not to worry about it, playing it off as it was nothing.   


since that, it's been quiet for 3 more days, and i really have no clue what to think anymore. What the hell is going on, can someone enlighten me?   


Ask questions if needed, ill be here lurking...",1536168855
ISTJ,"29/F ISTJ here. Childhood was such that I subscribe to /r/raisedbynarcissists and /r/AsianParentStories and still burdens me painfully every day. Things like Silent Treatment, slamming doors, being told I shouldn't have been born, etc. have negatively affected my ability to understand interpersonal relationships and expressions of emotion. Despite this, bf and I have been together for 1.5 years now, so it's pretty serious, but not without its hardships.

&amp;#x200B;

I am never more confused than when I'm confronted with emotions, whether they are my own or of others. Every time either bf or I gets upset, I'm overwhelmed by waves of strange feelings that I don't know how to describe or respond to, so I stay quiet, which frustrates both of us further. He's very logical, even more so than I am, but sometimes it doesn't help when I'm struggling with something that seems like it can only be understood in an emotional context. An example would be that I understand logically, it would benefit me to get over my childhood, but emotionally, it's just so painful for me to try to let go.

&amp;#x200B;

I also have difficulty keeping ""relationship functions"" straight -- I might have to draw out a map or something. For example, he recently got upset because I was out with a friend and didn't text back for several hours because I legit lost track of time. I offered to call him on my drive home, but he said no, and then told me later he would have wanted me to talk to him upon arriving home. I have to think about this in terms of: IF bf is upset, THEN talk in person, NOT on phone.  In addition to things like this, I also have trouble picking up on social cues, so sometimes I don't even know that bf is upset, so the sequence doesn't kick into gear appropriately.

&amp;#x200B;

Knowing what to do in relationships is already immensely difficult for the rest of the population, so imagine how impossible it might seem to someone who never learned proper communication or displays of affection or ""intuitive"" responses to conflict. I keep my physical distance when I'm thinking, to ensure the most effective points of discussion are addressed, but have also been called cold, critical, uncaring, distant, etc. I had to ask my own parents if they could hug me, ffs, and now I'm in my own relationship where I am being asked to show more affection that is so alien to me.

ISTJ,"So to introduce myself, I'm a 18 yr old Guy, with big goals and aspirations in life, but is currently feeling worried and pissed off. Being at home for too long since I graduated has created a shit ton of anxiety, of the fact that I'm not DOING anything. I keep on overthinking to the point of feeling like I'm failing and losing time. As if every day I'm seen as some loser. The more time I have to think for myself, the worse it gets. I'm not sure if this is an Istj thing. Anyways

Appearance: I tend to be reserved and polite, usually am seen thinking to myself most of the time if I have nothing to do or waiting for something. I tend to be super focused on my tasks, and tend to try my best to follow the rules carefully. It gives me pride in knowing I follow and delegate orders, which makes me incredibly good at work or being placed in group projects.

Personality: as I mentioned, I can be ambitious and tend to be focused on the things i want done for the long-term. I focus on the present so i can be able to control the future. It is important for me to take in facts and be able to utilize it to paint a better picture of what I'm planning to do. I am super focused, serious, and really energetic. Though I can have my moments in which mood swings come in for w.e reason.

Career: Work-wise I try my best in everything I do. I plan on becoming a Police Officer and hopefully go into Cosplaying as a business or work at a Bank in the long-term. Atm I am planning to enlist in the military also. My mind is always buzzing with objectives, so I make sure to have a set goal in mind. If I don't, I'll feel useless and start to think of myself less. My career has to consist of having structure and being able to organize things so I can feel at east

Social life: Put me at a place where I don't know or really like anyone, I won't feel like talking or being humorous. I tend to be impulsive and straight to the point. When I want something done, it needs to be specific and have a contingency plan behind it. Establishing order and structure is something I want for the better of everyone. My closest friends tend to see me as rebellious when I see people acting incompetent and can be outspoken, but know that I'm focused and driven. 

Home life: my room will be placed in a neat and organized fashion. Seriously, I will walk into my room and everything is placed in a specific place for a reason. No messy clothes, DVDs organized in a certain order that I can easily find something in. I have a family member that's an INFP and is disorganized, so we tend to argue. Nevertheless I love and care about my family and friends because in the end, without family or a central upbringing, you wont feel complete. That's why my goal is to do w.e it takes to become successful and rise to the top. 

Downsides: I become super angry and frustrated when things don't go according to plan or a specific way that I expected it to be. I tend to be outwardly cold and harsh, but deep down I do have feelings just like the next person, I cry and can feel sad when I feel like I'm not living up to my standards. And I tend to become vindictive when I see someone who is just as harsh as me, because I know people like me wont get along well. That's why I usually like emotional people, I can connect with them and be open as I get to know em better.

When stressed out/depressed: I feel like I lose my sense of purpose. Whenever I remember my childhood i tend to feel frustrated because i never defended myself out of fear. Now that I'm older, I constantly remember about the past and feel paranoid about being seen as weak, useless, or a loser. If I am at home for too long I tend to start being at edge, constantly feeling angry because I can't get something done, or because I simple feel like I failed.

Another thing to point out is that I have this symptom called maladaptive daydreaming in which you tend to day dream using music (no lyrics) and you tend to fantasize for longer than 10 minutes about anything. Usually for me, I fantasize about the future how I will be successful based on how i will do the things i plan to do. Or if anything i daydream about being in a zombie apocalypse and being in charge of a huge community who attacks others and controls them for restoring humanity. I daydream on my free time, but its unconscious and it's completely out of character for me to do so.",1535671735

ISTJ,"Alone. Unloved. Miserable.

‚Äã

After I lost my (ISTJ) mother and the one other (ISTJ female) person that would listen to my analytical ramblings of passion, life was hell.

‚Äã

My father shamed me and told me that I was autistic. My sister that I loved most, found me annoying, lame, and repulsive.

‚Äã

I gave up my one activity that joined by problem-solving nature with an expression of emotion: Music. ... My emotions were no longer ex-pressed, so they began to be re-pressed. My health took a noise-dive.

‚Äã

When I stumbled upon Quiet, by Susan Cain, I felt so loved and understood that I wanted to jump for joy - which was unusual for my thoughtful and internalized personality.

‚Äã

Years later, when I discovered MBTI, I found that I was an INTx and I just kept shouting ""Yes! Yes!"" as I read about others with my same difficulties, loves, weaknesses, and strengths.

‚Äã

Finally, I realized that I am not an INTJ:

1. decisive
2. dresses formally
3. tends to dislike physical touch
4. does not require emotional or social validation from others.

‚Äã

Instead, I test clearly as an INTP:

1. indecisive
2. dresses casually and creatively
3. tends to crave physical touch, caressing, and hugging
4. desperately seeks emotional or social validation, which is inconvenient because INTPs crave mainly non-social environments.

‚Äã

Also, INTPs and find it extremely draining to maintain most social relationships. Showing up in a way that is agreeable to others, especially extroverts, is like balancing a stack of books on my head: it is an enjoyable challenge for about 30 seconds, and then from that point on, it is painfully inconvenient.

‚Äã

Ever since my family saw the Matrix (1999), I felt a special connection with Neo. I idealized Neo. I pretended I was Neo. I put Neo in my artwork. I only stopped referencing Neo once I reached the age when I felt to intimidated to be freely creative in my own geeky way. ... It was just this week that I realized that Neo was symbolic of an INTP living his/her full destiny and ""learning to fly"".

‚Äã

Now. A recognition of my ""better half"": the ISTJ or Protector personality. ... I can already tell a difference in my ability to love and accept myself, even before I have found an actual friend or lover who is an ISTJ (female).

‚Äã

So even the idea of there being a group of people out there who would be happy to know me. And who I could make happy without me wearing a social mask, without me pretending to be someone that I'm not: is incredibly refreshing.

‚Äã

I read a post from an ISTJ female who mentioned that she thought that we INTPs aren't attracted to ISTJs. And I just want to clear the record to say that just that thought of you ISTJs, let alone your actual presence, is to us INTPs completely:

1. endearing
2. inspiring
3. adorable
4. attractive
5. life-saving.

‚Äã

I believe that the ISTJ female I'm mentioning had just gone through a painful breakup with an INTP. ... And for what it is worth, just like I gave up my love of music for years because I thought that it ""wasn't practical and wasn't actually helping anyone in need"", we INTPs sometimes can forget how much our love for art and love for each other is ever so practical for health, happiness, and is so worth upholding.

Some people refer to ISTJs as \*fake\*. And to INTPs like me, ISTJs help us remember that love is \*real\*, and life is really worth living.

ISTJ,"Alright guys, so once and for all this is the big match of finding out what MBTI I am! So to introduce myself, I'm a 18 yr old Guy, with big goals and aspirations in life! 

Appearance: I tend to be reserved and polite, usually am seen thinking to myself most of the time if I have nothing to do or waiting for something. I tend to be super focused on my tasks, and tend to try my best to follow the rules carefully. It gives me pride in knowing I follow and delegate orders, which makes me incredibly good at work or being placed in group projects.

Personality: as I mentioned, I can be ambitious and tend to be focused on the things i want done for the long-term. I focus on the present so i can be able to control the future. It is important for me to take in facts and be able to utilize it to paint a better picture of what I'm planning to do. I am super focused, serious, and really energetic.

Career: Work-wise I try my best in everything I do. I plan on becoming a Police Officer and hopefully go into Cosplaying as a business or work at a Bank in the long-term. My mind is always buzzing with objectives, so I make sure to have a set goal in mind. If I don't, I'll feel useless and start to think of myself less. My career has to consist of having structure and being able to organize things so I can feel at east

Social life: Put me at a place where I don't know or really like anyone, I won't feel like talking or being humorous. I tend to be impulsive and straight to the point. When I want something done, it needs to be specific and have a contingency plan behind it. Establishing order and structure is something I want for the better of everyone. My closest friends tend to see me as rebellious when I see people acting incompetent and can be outspoken, but know that I'm focused and driven. 

Home life: my room will be placed in a neat and organized fashion. Seriously, I will walk into my room and everything is placed in a specific place for a reason. No messy clothes, DVDs organized in a certain order that I can easily find something in. I have a family member that's an INFP and is disorganized, so we tend to argue. Nevertheless I love and care about my family and friends because in the end, without family or a central upbringing, you wont feel complete. That's why my goal is to do w.e it takes to become successful and rise to the top. 

Downsides: I become super angry and frustrated when things don't go according to plan or a specific way that I expected it to be. I tend to be outwardly cold and harsh, but deep down I do have feelings just like the next person, I cry and can feel sad when I feel like I'm not living up to my standards. And I tend to become vindictive when I see someone who is just as harsh as me, because I know people like me wont get along well. That's why I usually like emotional people, I can connect with them and be open as I get to know em better.",1534888398
ISTJ,"I took a bucket load of MBTI tests online, and it's always between ISFJ &amp; ISTJ, I need your help to settle this once and for all.

Personal life

In my personal life I'm often described as being detached and careless at times, those who know me best know that it's not entirely true, I just keep to myself a lot, that's why. I'm also described as harsh and inconsiderate when telling people what's on my mind or how I react to a certain thing, I just call things as I see them.

Conflict management

I dislike conflict (family especially) and I hate drama, I would go out of my way to eliminate drama so I can maintain peace, I don't like sudden change such as change of plans or something going in an unexpected way, my dislike of conflict doesn't mean I won't fight for my right or stand up for myself.

I have troubles dealing with emotions (mine and others), and usually fail to understand hints and what not, unless if it's communicated clearly, chances are I'll miss it.

Love and relationships

In relationships I'm the loyal one, hard working and devoted, always trying to make my partner happy, I expect to get as much as I give in a relationship and when that doesn‚Äôt happen, I get really frustrated, I try to communicate my frustrations and how I feel but it‚Äôs difficult and never quite as I imagine it in my head, I tend to shutdown after fights / big arguments and I would stop talking to them for days on end.

When I see that things are heading towards a dead end, I try my best to rescue what can be rescued, then walk away when all efforts are futile.

Friendships

I have a lot of acquaintances but very few friends, I enjoy a lot of alone time reading or browsing the internet, socializing is a grueling task to me, which I avoid often, I either go silent or talk a lot, sadly I have no medium there, mostly talking about past experiences, I suffer from anxiety and OCD (not sure if relevant or not).

I‚Äôm formal even with my close friends and appreciate the smallest effort.

I'm an organized person, I keep detailed notes of everything: journals, expenses, notes, and I vent on paper, my room isn't always tidy but I clean it often (once a week at least).

Professional life

At work I go by the book most of the time, I'm strict and orderly and often described as the tough teacher, I prefer to go by the rules and regulations, unless they make no sense to me, then I will bend them, that's when something seems to be out of order. I put a lot of effort into work and make sure it's done right, then do some more. If I'm not convinced by a task or if it's contradicts with a value of mine, I won't do it, I would go as far as quitting a job if I feel it doesn't satisfy my goals or that I'm not going forward or being held down by management, despite following rules and regulations I'd rebel if I feel that I'm being treated unfairly and would walk away if my rightful demands aren't met (I am usually reasonable and realistic in my demands and I don't go overboard with them).

Dislikes and pet peeves

In life in general I value order, I hate traffic jams, loud noises, whiny children, inconsistent people ‚Äì this ranks up pretty high on my pet peeve list -, I also dislike contradicting people. I always think of ways to solve problems and make things run more smoothly, even if I don't voice them out clearly.

How I get things done

I tend to experiment with stuff (methods of doing things, computer software, etc), once I'm set with a good way of doing things I keep repeating it until I master it, and it would take something better for me to drop the old way of doing things and migrating to something new.

I learn by doing, I usually would skip checking the manual until something won't be resolved, I guess I learn by trail and error.

I like being productive and finding the best way to do things, best being sometimes easier, done in less time or costs less.

I don't mind routine in certain things but generally like to keep things fresh, like when I'm teaching a subject I like to use new examples and ways to keep the topic interesting rather than repeating the same material over and over every semester.

Shopping

When shopping I always hunt for affordable items and rarely break the bank for something, I'd go as far as saying that I'm a minimalist, as I hate stockpiling things without putting them to use, I also like hunting for the best deal available and try to make use of sales when possible. I also enjoy fixing old things and maintaining things running for as long as possible, even more than shopping for new things.

Life overview

I have a darker perspective on life which many people consider pessimistic or down right depressing, I'm just being realistic, that's all.

I tend to point out the negative things and it‚Äôs hard for me to see the positive side of things (possible with effort, perhaps due to upbringing or current living conditions?).

I compare my life to the past a lot, and often reminisce about things that happened, I somehow think it's better than the present.

I am an ISTJ. 38/MALE/Engineer/Project Manager. Would like your input if you work in Corporate America:

1. How  do you deal with people at work who dont do their job but are good at  fooling the bosses? 2)How do you deal with passive aggresdive coworkers?
2. In  meetings we agree on one thing but than the other group changes mind  but pretends we made that decision n laugh it off. Now if i call BS they  look at me funny but I can tell they want to lead but dont want  accountability nor responsibility. They will throw someone under the bus  if plan doesnt work but are not real enough to take the heat if things  fail. I feel like they are just kissing ass n collecting paychecks .
3. They  send friendly smiles in email when changing what they originally said. I  go by facts n I dont trust ones who change their mind when building a  product.
4. I  can see phony from a mile n spot them. Problem is by the time company  finds out they fired me or I left. I feel like matthew m in True  detective. I see it but they dont love me cause of my delivery.
5. They put me down using indirect harrassing. They would say infront of everybody thank god i am in another team, and i would be like y? which they make up some crap.
   1. They would try to help others when no one asked. they refuse help. These coworkers look at me and say i should help also, but im thinking they just said no to you. I reported one to HR. HR is a moron. HR is like they are friendly. I am like why are they inviting me to plug in others laptop when no one asked them to. I swear I hate ENFJs",1534728228

-i don't like fixing things with my hands like the typical istp

-i like problem solving and analyzing but in other ways than with your hands(ex: figuring out stocks)

-i am usually reserved but around people i know/just get a long with i can be outgoing

-my fashion sense is kinda plain but with just enough style imo, not crap

-i work in spurts of energy and usually procrastinate(motivates me)

-i don't really know what i want to do career wise and i wish i could kind of just do my own thing but that has to work out perfect imo.

-i like investments and want to look further into how to make good ones but feel i need to learn with time although im doing pretty good imo

-i do care about people but i don't think im the most caring either

-usually easy going but if you rub me the wrong way i can be cold although if you are someone i know i will give you the benefit of the doubt

-hobbies include sports, fishing, gaming, listening to music, buying stuff(maybe clothes), stocks and investments but i need to get more money haha

-in a way i kind of care what people think but then i dont at the same time. i want to be happy and not have to follow the social ""norms"" all the time to be accepted while making it harder on myself to basically please others.

-don't like doing things that dont make sense

-when plans are made i prefer for them to follow through but understand they can change.

-don't mind working in teams especially if i get a long with or can work with the group members but i can also work alone.

ISTJ,"I spent about a year getting close to a male (24) ISTJ, and have only recently fully gained his trust.  We had planned to hangout a few nights ago, but as that time came around one of my friends came into town and we decided to go out.   I didn't know how he'd take it if I told him I wasn't gonna hangout with him because I was going out with him, so I texted him and told him that I was feeling tired and we'd hangout later.  

Of course he found out, and he gave me the cold shoulder for a good week before he finally brought it up.   He told me that it stung a bit that he got moved to the back burner, but what he couldn't forget is that I wasn't completely honest with him.  He said that lying, regardless of the size of the lie, was the fastest way to completely burn our friendship.

I'm not sure why I created a reddit just to ask this question, or what I'm even looking for... I just care about him a lot, and he's been such a big part of my life this past year.   I know I screwed up and should have just been honest, but there's gotta be something I can do to make it up?   I understand that ISTJ's are very direct, honest, stubborn, and don't give away their loyal friendships quickly.   Because of this, I'm concerned that I turned something so small into an irreparable mistake...

I've been working in this field for a year and im never sure of what I know / what I dont know. My job is actually very boring since its an old office, I dont feel like im learning a lot. 

Im always thinking of doing something else... like computer programming, or being a cook, whatever something exciting. Just doing someting that I can see a result. I just dont have any satisfaction when I've finished something, because there is always someone else that is finishing it and its always the same thing.  And when they ask me to a see a customer and watch all these bills, I just cant see the fun in that. I dont get the challenge.

How do you deal with being sitting a desk all day? I just cant believe that ill be doing that for most of my life. I know that I can do a lot of money... but its so boring. 

I took the MBTI test 2 years ago and I was a fit for accounting. I didnt really much care in school, I was actually good at the moment. But, the more the time passes, the more Im doing badly in school, my motivation is just dropping. The other student have so much motivation to understand everything, but I dont see the point of perfectly knowing everything.

Sometimes I get very confused with what he says versus what he actually does. 

And the reason why I care in the first place is because I do genuinely want him to be happy and encourage him to pursue what he wants for his life. 

Some examples of this are him saying he does not love his girlfriend and yet he decides to stay with her. It is like he internally knows what is wrong but does not want to listen to his intuition and get out of the relationship.

Another example is conforming religiously even though he does not hold those religious beliefs.

I am here to ask for insight on why this might be the case? It might not be particularly an ISTJ thing, but any kind of insight would be helpful.

""Often representing the epitome of family values, people with the ISTJ personality type are comfortable with, and often even encourage traditional household and gender roles, and look to a family structure guided by clear expectations and honesty.""  


This is basically the complete opposite of the way I am. In fact, one of the things I enjoy most about my husband is the fact that he doesn't expect me to fulfill the traditional housewife role, because it does not interest me in the least. Even outside of family, I consistently fight against gender roles and stereotypes, and I don't feel like ""tradition"" is nearly as important as many of these websites make it out to be for ISTJs.

ISTJ,"I have always had trouble operating in the very emotional/feelings based modern world. As someone who has always been very harshly realistic in my approach to life (due to my personality and personal experiences), I have felt alienated in most of my young life. I have a graduate job interview coming up next week with a prestigious organisation that is very... ideologically based (politically and culturally) and while it is my ideal job as it is based on my studies the culture honestly scares the crap out of me.

I don't agree with the ideology at all and frankly, I believe that even if I try to act and gain rapport, my natural lack of agreeableness (1% when I tested it) will protrude during my show. Logically I don't really care about that sort of stuff, I just want to work and be productive in a field that I am skilled in, but I worry that they are too ideological and will try to maintain a monopoly in their work culture. 

That's the crux of my issue. Based on my observations there is simply no place for someone like me in the modern world, I am way too realistic. I don't really have hobbies, sure there are things I do to waste time, but that's why I do them and I am not passionate about anything other than progressing in my career/life due to missing out on so much time and ruining parts of my youth due to unforeseen sickness. I've been told by mentors to wait till I approach my 30s to get serious in terms of a career, that sounds like a massive amount of time wasted in my 20s.

The worst thing is that this disconnect with modern people is ruining my happiness because I feel frustrated that I just don't understand why things are so emotional? Frankly, every day goes by and I become more frustrated and more misanthropic.

ISTJ,"This obviously means to note the difference between sensing or intuition. INTJ Makes sense for me, but I care about my reputation and ego. If I feel like I dont have an identity I will panic. So based on the MBTI Test I got 4 options, INTJ, ESTJ,  ENTJ, and ISTJ.

First of all, for some reason, I tend to admire characters that can obviously be ENTJ's, but I somehow have a odd perception on how I view both in which might make me feel uncomfortable:

ENTJ: since they are rare, they are these absolute alphas of the world, who tend to be cool-headed and 100% confident and outgoing.(i have somewhat of an emotional attitude towards myself so I tend to analyze myself constantly.)
ESTJ:The manager that is traditional and constantly angry about some imperfection or something going wrong, may have strict morals and values. Now knowing I get these results no matter what, it has to be one of them as there are things that are relatable. For instance,

-I absolutely am determined and ambitious, I dream of one day becoming a CEO and being well known for being someone of authority. I have BIG ambitions, and from the ESTJ type, it seems that ambition tends to be small. I want something big in my life.
-I can be emotional (anger/frustration) when things don't go how I expect, and can lash out and become insensitive. I have my moments of vulnerability, but I will absolutely hate it as I view it as weak.
-I'm not really ""traditional"" but I respect authority, because I want to establish order myself in some way. I usually go for emotional satisfaction over absolute efficiency
-I used to feel introverted and lacked confidence due to pride and anxiety, which in turn has had people view me as incredibly cruel for some reason.
-I am selective about who are my close friends, I can talk to people if I want to, but I'm not the ""life of the party"" type. Seriously, I find it impractical and a waste of time. 
-I hate the notion of being seen as anything BUT as respectable. Seriously I used to argue with my father about rules and how things should be done since he is a stereotypical ESTJ. 
-I ABSOLUTELY hate sitting around and doing nothing, granted, I'm lazy as heck, but I just don't like being seen as a lazy loser ever.
-My goals in life is to major in finance so I can become a military officer, along with my personal goals being to build confidence. I tend to daydream often about me being someone important in the future.
-I have extreme values when it comes to those I care about. You hurt them and I will screw you over. Besides that I tend to go off the rails when people try to insult me.
-In high school I lost my temper often, and was known as the person who always got in trouble for questioning authority (I see them as fucking incompetent) or lashing out at others. I used to be controlling in relationships, but luckily I've matured.

1) there are a lot of standard operating procedures (SOPs) involved in our work, and sometimes I get too focused on the end result that I forget to perform certain steps, which would provide some tangential information or prevent a catastrophic failure in some extremely unlikely situations;

when he notices that I did something like that, although nothing can be changed anymore, he comes to me all emotional and expresses a reaction as if I did the biggest mistake ever;

2) if he disagrees with the way I do things, he doesn't come to discuss with me but goes around and slanders to other people;

3) the people he did not (does not) like in his life were (are) doing EVERYTHING wrong; I don't know if I ever heard a positive comment about someone he holds a grudge on;

4) if he breaks something, and someone sees it, it is ALWAYS the thing which was faulty; I never heard him blaming himself. If no one is around, I believe he just doesn't tell anyone; if I break something, his reaction is as in 1);

on the contrary, for me the information is very valuable for the future predictions; so if I apply too much force along certain angle and some glassware will break, I will tell that information to everybody;

however, when the equipment doesn't work I no longer know if it was something I did, or if he already messed it up before (and getting that information is even more complicated now, as I've stopped speaking with him);

ISTJ,"enfp here!! I don't know what it is about your type but I find myself swooning over y'all. just the confidence that you have and the ability to be so calm and in the moment is something that really makes me fascinated!! 

i've been with my istj for about a month and a half and with each day we seem to be getting closer and closer and as long as I don't get too deep into my feelings everything is funny and fun and there is no worries. he is my best friend and we could spend hours just laughing with each other, in some ways we always seem to be on the same wavelength. however!!! i have a lot of feelings and sometimes i just could explode into a puddle of love but that is not something that happens very often. my istj is very affectionate with me and he knows my need for affirmation and often he fulfills it when we are together. I am about to be going back to school and while I wouldn't mind continuing the relationship it doesn't seem like this is something he is interested in, he never thinks too far into the future because nothing is really promised or set in stone but in my view I am always creating this vivid future that I want to strive for and he is very much in it for me. i did end up going to meet his family for dinner spur of the moment because he asked but maybe i'm reading too much into that.

basically the point of the post is how do you like to be told that you are loved and adored without your SO overwhelming you? how do you know if a relationship is something special and if you'd want to continue? would you ever just go with your heart and hope it works out or is the logical possibility of it not working not even worth trying?

ISTJ,"Honestly I posted this in another subreddit, and I described myself to see what people thought and they told me I seem more like an ESTJ,ISTJ or ENTJ. So I'm hoping perhaps I can find out here what you guys think.

So one thing to point out, I'm a high school graduate, but unfortunately with so many complications I cant go to college yet. This frustrates me because I just dislike me staying at home. I try my best finding a job, and I overall don't want to stay at home doing nothing.

Anyways I'm just gonna describe myself and from there on you guys can determine what y'all think.

1.Appearance-wise, I seem serious, analytical, and intelligent. People meeting me at first tends to see me as polite but dry. One of my weaknesses is small talk. I can handle it, but for some reason i just feel that unless im talking about something important to me, its pointless.

2.Personality-wise, I am just very serious and ambitious. In high school I was lazy unless there was something I was interested in or it mattered to me. I'm incredibly short-tempered and usually have emotional outbursts when things dont go my way. Now I'm aware this is not a good thing, so I'm hoping to find a way to change that. I'm also incredibly prideful, so I tend to feel like shit if i see others do better than me, and drives me to do better.

3.My goals in life is to pursue leadership/management positions and try my best to learn how to lead. There is nothing more I want in my life to be seen as a leader, to see that the people i help and have under control work well with me. I genuinely want to learn how to be outstanding. My Career goals for this is honestly getting a management job, whether in the Military, Law Enforcement, or Government.

4.My negative side is I tend to have emotional outbursts. I am logical and to the point, but due to my childhood being shit or the past in which I felt disrespected and taken advantage of, I've kind of developed a ""My way or the high way"" attitude, which is not practical to have outwardly. Besides anger, empathy is very limited and only for my family and friends. 

5.I can't stand to think that people or things get in my way of my goals. I tend to become ruthless and full of rage. I tend to be obedient and reliable since I'm well grounded most of the time.

6.Remember the pride part? Well back then, my ego was a big thing. I realize that this was toxic, but nevertheless has gotten me to become controlling with my past relationships and friends. 

7.I have a close group of friends. I'm not extroverted in the sense that I have a bunch of friends, but rather I have a close group of friends and outside of it I meet different sorts of people. I tend to be very outgoing with my friends and social when It requires it.

8.Ive rarely been in a leadership position in high school. I tried running for class president one time along with joining a Business club, I participated there a lot. Besides that though, I have little to no leadership experience, and it genuinely makes me feel like shit. I can't stand being a loser or average. I want to stand out, become a leader so I can help others and be looked upto. I am known for being ""egotistic"" but I feel that being ambitious has made me feel good.

9.At the moment, my sense of success and control over things represent who I am, without both, I'm nothing. Sort of how I'm feeling now recently.

10. I tend to get super jealous and vengeful. Once again, I'm trying to find a way to keep it under control as I know it's not healthy. But overall emotionally I remember things clearly, but since I tend to be more logical, I supress my emotions.

Anyways tell me what you guys think! ",1532400794

ISTJ,"I thought I was an ISTJ and still kind of do, but some things don‚Äôt apply to me. Quite a few things from INTP do apply to me. Tell me if I‚Äôm ISTJ or not.

Some key examples:
1. Getting things done on time - I procrastinate a lot. Tend to do things in the last moment, unless I‚Äôm really interested in what I‚Äôm doing. Used to think I‚Äôm always on time and get things done in efficient way until I moved in with INTJ and ESTJ.
2. Cleanliness- I love cleanliness but I hate actual cleaning. Therefore I don‚Äôt until the point I just have to.
3. Boring - I‚Äôm not boring. I am an introvert, but I love exploring new things and places, and going out with extroverts. I do have the tendency to be the ‚Äúdad‚Äù of the group though. And do like to plan things out, but also have tendency to ‚Äúwing it‚Äù when people around me get too granular. 
4. Rules - rules should be followed unless they don‚Äôt make sense to me.
5. I focus on practical things, while having a ton of unpractical ideas and thoughts in my head. Do like to just think about stuff and how something would turn out.
6. Thinking/logic: yes. Love figuring things out - but only on subjects interesting to me. Same with learning - I can‚Äôt sit down a learn something because I have to. I need to be intrigued by it to study it.
7. No nonsense type of person. Straight forward and honest. 
8. Emotions: Feel them strongly - hard time explaining or knowing how to deal with them. 
9. Quote traditional - except things that don‚Äôt make sense to me. ‚ÄúJust do it‚Äù or ‚Äúbecause it has to be that way‚Äù don‚Äôt fly with me. I need reason.

ISTJ,"I won't go into all the details. In summary, both people (ENFP and ISTJ) were at fault for the way things happened in their romantic relationship. The ISTJ brought a lot of unresolved feelings and anger from his past into the relationship which the ENFP tried to help him work through but, was never truly successful at. I believe the ISTJ has never opened up to anyone else the way he opened up with the ENFP. There was deep feelings, confiding, friendship and love on both sides, but, there was also a lot that went down over a period of many years leaving both sides feeling hurt and betrayed. Unfortunately, after 7 years and, at the end, a life-changing, stressful situation for the ISTJ that the ENFP in hindsight should have handled better, the ISTJ simply walked away and moved to another state without giving any closure to the ENFP or even telling her that he was leaving. Not even a conversation or a phone call. And when she tried to reach him, at the time it happened, he wouldn't answer. Well, it's 6 years later and the ENFP has made attempts to sincerely apologize and own her part for the past and desperately wants to connect with the ISTJ to at the very least get some closure. While they have had some contact, the ISTJ very clearly now has a wall up. With what little contact they have had, he has openly admitted that he is now bitter, angry, cynical, jaded, and doesn't believe in God anymore. Sometimes he responds to her attempts to reach out, but, most of the time, he ignores. But, then, randomly, he will reach out to her unexpectedly and when she responds sometimes they will have a weird conversation where he acts like a different person but, other times he will go back into hiding from her. There was a time for a little while when the two started texting regularly and ISTJ seemed to want to text her but then was almost antagonistic towards her most of the time...saying things that he knew would upset her and then lashing out at her when she got upset. ENFP is at a loss. Knows the ISTJ is hurting and in a dark place and cares for him deeply still but, doesn't know how to reach him. Worried that he is struggling with some addiction issues and bad choices, too. Would love some advice. ",1531337764

ISTJ,"**Congratulations!**

You have just selected your very own ISTJ Worker Unit. As our most popularly selected introverted unit you are sure to be satisfied with your very own ISTJ. If for any reason you are not satisfied, you are simply not being direct and clear enough with your ISTJ unit and that is your own damn fault. So that you may enjoy your unit to it‚Äôs fullest extent, your SJ overlords have included this handy guide.

## Your ISTJ will come with the following accessories:

* Six (6) plaid or solid-colored shirts  

* Four (4) pairs of jeans (light blue, dark blue, black, and brown)  

* One (1) belt that has been worn since high school and will be worn for however long it shall live. Because it works.  

* Two (2) pairs of shoes - one for daily wear, one for dress  

* Bonus sports shoes included with athletic upgrade  

* One (1) set of tools and toolbox. Includes basic tools for routine maintenance and repairs to anything they purchased for more than $1000  

* One (1) canine companion  

* One (1) set of How-To Books  

* One (1) duty-powered core reactor \[Warning: Slightly Radioactive\]  


## Software

Your ISTJ comes pre-programmed with the following traits;

**Si:** Your ISTJ is acutely aware of personal impact and past precedent. This trait includes the ability to recall events and exchanges of personal significance with immense detail and clarity. This function allows your ISTJ to form memories with such detail that they are experienced as reliving the event. Because of this your ISTJ unit is uniquely sensitive to changes in it‚Äôs environment and people around it. Your ISTJ is also strongly aware of it‚Äôs own physical sensations and comfort as well as the physical comfort of those it is near.

**Te:** Your ISTJ will act efficiently and effectively when interacting with it‚Äôs external environment. Your ISTJ is a skilled organizer, delegator and trouble shooter. This function targets waste and inefficiencies and eliminates them to ensure the system is running at it‚Äôs highest functional level.

**Fi:**¬†Your ISTJ may be taciturn, but it is equipped with deeply held values. Your ISTJ will have personal preferences and tastes that it is both very sure of and strongly attached to. This function is responsible for adding the unique variety to each ISTJ unit that is only accessible with regular use and interaction.

**Ne:**¬†Your ISTJ is prone to catastrophizing about the future due to the inferior placement of it‚Äôs Ne function. Your ISTJ will be resistant to change and new ideas and is likely to dislike discussing hypothetical situations because of the stress they can induce. In cases where your ISTJ unit‚Äôs Ne overpowers the dominant Si software, your unit may feel a need to destroy all current systems and structure and resort instead to individuality and anarchism.

## Getting Started

1. Insert duty-powered core reactor into your ISTJ unit‚Äôs duty port (located between shoulder blades on back of unit)  

2. Place ISTJ unit in an isolated area with included set of How-To Books
3. Allow at least 2 hours of solitude for ISTJ to absorb information and charge
4. Present ISTJ unit with included toolbox and a practical puzzle or problem in need of solution
5. If your ISTJ unit does not activate after step 4, leave unit to charge overnight and try step 4 again
6. If step 5 also fails, repeat step 4 again, but with included canine companion as well

## Modes

Fix-It Mode (*default*) - When presented with a problem and reasonably assigned responsibility for solving said problem, your ISTJ will successfully fix or solve the problem assigned.

Chill Mode (*default*) - Active when ISTJ is alone or with a maximum of 2 pre-approved closely bonded companion units. Required for a minimum of 2 hours a day for optimum performance. While in this mode your ISTJ will have significantly subdued energy levels, little to no articulation, and will instead enjoy the company of included canine companion and silence.

Get Shit Done Mode - Activated when assigned responsibility for completion of a set of tasks necessary to ensure continued harmony and operation of ISTJ‚Äôs life, work, and/or family. Involves only the minimum articulation necessary and zero (0) patience for unproductivity or waste.

What Needs to be Done Mode - Activated when ISTJ determines that a particular task must be completed in order to ensure continued harmony or operation of a system or situation, but that said task is not being completed by the responsible parties, or is being completed poorly. Includes silent resentment towards the responsible parties, but successful completion of the task nonetheless. Repeated activation of What Needs to be Done Mode will result in your ISTJ unit‚Äôs refusal to help or participate in any future events or activities involving the responsible party.

Righteous Indignation Mode - Activated by applying inaccurate statements or labels to ISTJ or by accusing ISTJ of making an error without providing evidence. May result in emotional outbursts.

Try Something New Mode (*locked*) - Only unlockable with sufficient advanced notice and preparation. Your ISTJ unit is very capable of trying new things, but must be given adequate time to prepare by gaining more information first.

## Relationships with Other Units

**NF:** Generally fascinating and adored by your ISTJ unit, these units can also become annoying if they decide your ISTJ is in need of improvement.

**NT:** Usually well tolerated and respected, but at times can seem overbearing or arrogant to your ISTJ unit.

**SJ:** Well tolerated and most easily understood. Reliable units that can be called on for help if needed.

**SP:** Interesting, but still quite confusing. These units seem to understand your ISTJ unit better than it understands them.

## Feeding

Your ISTJ unit will feed itself regularly and if asked kindly, will likely also feed other units if your ISTJ possesses greater cooking ability.

## Grooming

As long as your ISTJ unit is not stuck in a Si-Fi loop, it will regularly groom itself without any prompting. Looping units may occasionally need to be locked in a bathroom and told to clean themselves.

## Sleeping

Your ISTJ unit will sleep when appropriate and necessary. Looping units may engage in too much sleep, but can usually be fixed by being presented with a puzzle in need of solving.

## Frequently Asked Questions

*What is my ISTJ thinking?*

Most of the time, your ISTJ is thinking about whatever was just happening, however sometimes (unbeknownst to ISTJ), they will be thinking about a past event so deeply that it feels as though it is the present.

*How do I get ISTJ to talk to me?*

The easiest way to get your ISTJ to talk to you is to act it direct questions and wait for a response. Otherwise, your ISTJ will also respond to riddles.

*Is my ISTJ stuck on repeat?*

No, your ISTJ has simply mastered it‚Äôs environment and found a routine that is perfectly suited. Your ISTJ will now adhere to this routine, often until long after it has ceased to be the most effective and efficient use of it‚Äôs time and environment.

*How do I get my ISTJ to try a new method of doing something?*

By proving that the new method works better than the current method.

ISTJ,"I'm an ENFP. I was in a relationship with an ISTJ for many years. We were very in love but, between the two of us, we couldn't make it work. I won't go into all the reasons why...it wasn't just because of our differences in personalities, though. Six years later, I have more regrets than I care to admit...I see things now I wish I would have done differently that I believe really hurt him. I apologized for some of them at the time, but, we continued to struggle. There were a lot of outside factors that began to change him, too. His job, his family, etc...he started to become more and more angry and bitter. I didn't know how to handle it along with everything else he was going through so I came in and out of his life a lot. I focused on his faults more than I focused on encouraging him, I nagged, created drama, put my feelings before his...I was selfish. I wasn't a safe place for him to land when he needed it because I was always worried about myself first. He deserved better from someone who claimed to be his best friend, but, I was so caught up in making him ""earn me"" all the time, that I left him high and dry a lot. Over the years, his character changed and he became angry, bitter, and more and more closed-off. Eventually, he left me...something I never thought he would do. There were other circumstances involved in him leaving (it wasn't just me), but, it still took me by surprise. It hurt me very deeply.

I know I sound like a horrible person, but, believe me, it took two to tango. He wasn't innocent in all of this and he knew it. I was angry at him for a long time for the way he left that I couldn't forgive him for a long time. Now, the smoke has cleared, years have gone by. We've communicated some, but, he always keeps a wall up now and because my feelings have been so raw for so long, I probably had a wall of my own up. He has a ""persona""...a passive-aggressive wall of his most immature possible self. He seems completely void of any sentiment or emotion involving the past...like he flipped a switch off...which is not how he used to be with me. I don't blame him. After a lot of introspection, I can see how deeply I must have hurt him. I want to apologize but, I feel like words are cheap after everything we've said and been through. I don't know how to reach him now, though. I'm not even sure if the man I once knew is still there or if life has changed him into this characature of who he presents himself to be today. But, there was a time when he was genuine. It was a long time ago. All I want to know is what is the best way to apologize to him and to reach his heart again (if it's still in there) and to regain his trust? I never got closure. I miss him every single day. If I had to do it over again, I would do so many things different...but, I was young and dumb. And now he lives in another state. ",1530668411
ISTJ,"I'm an ISTJ 1w9 and developed faith in god around a year ago at 30 years old.  I'm about as stubborn and hard-headed as they come and never really thought about god because it wasn't relevant.  My mindset was, believing in god didn't bring me towards my goals therefore I'm not going to exert energy or waste my time thinking about it.

Previous to coming to Christ, I was very into all types of self motivation - conquering my mind type stuff.  I came across Baptist Christian motivational type preaching on Youtube and that inspired me to go to Church and see fire &amp; brimstone sermons.  

My mindset was: if as humans we cannot understand how we exist then we have to admit that it's a possibility that we are not capable of understanding the whole truth.  Therefore I lose nothing by going to church, it would just be a failed hypothesis sort of thing.

So I went to church, prayed to god, and a series of events happened in my life that developed my faith.  From there, it was understanding the theology &amp; finding the denomination that fit best and have been growing in Christ ever since.

Just thought I'd throw this out there as ISTJ's (I'd assume) are the least likely to believe in god.  Happy to answer any questions or hear any stories of fellow ISTJ Christians.

ISTJ,"I posted it and deleted it earlier this week because I was overwhelmed with what I felt. I wanted to revisit it now that I had a chance to step away from it. I think I understood the beauty and depth of a relationship with an ISTJ.

I met Jordan my first year of college. We were both dragged to this club by someone we knew. I remember his messy hair and how he didn't break eye contact with me. He approached me, and we became friends. I was pretty immature back then and treated him pretty poorly, and by that I mean I was just too blunt with him and everyone. But I think ultimately, it was just the sting of not sugarcoating my actual feelings, and I can definitely say that I was completely honest with him throughout our entire friendship.

We barely hung out, but every time I needed to unload, I felt comfortable bringing up my life to him. We talked a lot, texted a lot. It was a comfortable, uncomplicated relationship that didn't need maintenance. I liked that. I knew he had a crush on me, mostly because he would say so once in a while. I told him how I felt about it-- I just didn't feel the same way, but I wished him happiness. He was graceful in the rejection.

He stayed over one night. Needed a place to crash after a flight and his move-in date was the day after. I was meeting up with a guy that night, so I gave him my keys. Said I'd be there later that night. I ended up falling suddenly and deeply in love with an ENFP I had met a week earlier. I came back around 3AM, ran through the city to get home out of fear of getting attacked at that hour. I bursted through my room, breathing heavily. He woke up, asked me about my night, and I shared my elation. Everyone in my life at that time knew how out of character meeting this guy had made me -- I never talked about anyone liked that. The look on his face was unexpressive, but I felt some kind of small sadness from him. I knew why, but there was nothing I could do about it. I slept on the floor, but he had carried me into my bed at some point. It was a strange sensation to wake up next to someone in bed. It was a rare experience for me. He had kissed me on the cheek but honestly I was so groggy at that time I can barely remember the specifics of that moment. I think it was a big moment for him. I always feel a shadow of heavy emotion at random moments with him. Or maybe because he was always a very innocent person. A part of me feels guilty for fucking some dude the night before.

We hung out only a handful of times over six years.

He got a girlfriend a year or so later. I was happy for him, asked about her. ""She's two years younger than me,"" he said. ""I like that she listens to me."" The way he said that seemed kind of pointed in my direction. 

There's something really annoying about Jordan. He seems to look at my life as some kind of tv show -- it feels like he uses it as entertainment. He told me years later that's why he was so *fascinated* by me. I hated that so much. To be treated so lightly. The pain from the reckless decisions I made, the heartbreak, the rejections and failures... I wanted support from him, not for him to watch me and bask excitedly in a hint of stimulation from my life. See, Jordan never fails. I hung out with him and his friends once and they were all these stuck-up rich Ivy League snobs who constantly try to one-up each other. I stored their stuff for months and lent my place out for them during transition periods but the only impression I got from them was this general feeling of ""why does Jordan hang out with this girl?"". Ungrateful. Disrespectful. Jordan's kind of like that, too -- looks down on people he thinks is stupid, and I guess why I take it so personally when he gives me this attitude like he sees me as some kind of loser burnout but I'm cool and a risk-taker (his impression, not mine), so it's okay. 

But at the same time, I can't blame him. Hanging out with his friends, knowing about his family... it's clear he grew up in a repressed kind of environment and I can only interpret his ""fascination"" as trying to live freely through my own life. He wants things to be interesting, and even if it does feel like he looks down on me... I can't help but feel a yearning for my attention. It's clear that he wants to be in my life, to be my friend, and for me to like him, if only just as a friend. Why would you want that from someone you truly looked down on? My heart aches for him when I entertain that thought.

I help him move into a new apartment a year or so later. I had nothing to do and was kind of lonely. I do most of the heavy work. I'm drenched in sweat, he's enjoying a drink. He thanks me and when I sit down on the couch, he cuddles me. I tell him it makes me uncomfortable when he touches me, especially when I know he has a girlfriend. ""Yeah,"" he says. ""I'll probably won't tell her."" I push him off, and take a breather. He attempts again, so I get up and help him start sorting the rest of his stuff. At the end of the day, he holds me in a hug and I don't stop him. It had reached the point where it was more work to reject and push him away. He holds me and says,""I found out most girls are like that.""

One day, he invites me to lunch. Haven't hung out with him in a while, so I go. I had been deprived of his company enough to want it, and I always enjoy it when I feel that way. He has a promise ring on, we talk about what has happened between the last time we hung out and now. It's a comfortable conversation, I have plenty of stories to share. He's entertained. We wait at the bus stop after. He tells me he's going to move to another state for a job. I'm caught off guard. It's so unexpected. I have never missed anyone who had moved, but tears started welling up in my eyes. ""I didn't know we were that close,"" he said. ""We've only hung out like five times throughout college"". Yeah, I thought that, too. But the emotion overwhelm me. I don't know why. Maybe because I'd miss the comfort I found with him. He puts his hand on my mouth, and kisses the back of his hand. He says goodbye. He says he'll miss me, too. I go back home, go into my roommate's room, sit on her bed, and cry. She and her boyfriend, close friends of mine, sit around me and sympathize. ""Did you like him?"" she asks. No... not like that. He was a precious friend, though.

Three years later, he's back in town. I'm tempted to duck out on the offer to meet up. It's been a long time, I don't remember how to act around him. We've barely spoken to each other, barely texted each other. Only for birthdays, but even then we've started to just shrug it off when the date passes. I do it anyway. A part of me recalls that I value him as a friend. I meet up with him, and his habit of wanting to know the juicy stories comes out. I get annoyed. My life has been pretty uneventful, and he calls it boring. Sorry for existing and living my life, I guess. His base pay is 200k-- nearly four times what I make. I feel the sting of losing an unspoken competition.

We enjoy the rest of the day. It started off awkward but had comfortably and slowly transitioned into the atmosphere it used to be. He tells me about his plans, to move back home and buy a house for him and his girlfriend. I feel a deep sense of happiness for him. ""I remember when I met you and I had a crush on you,"" he says. ""Well... it wasn't a crush, I think. It was more of a strong fascination"". Ah, I think. He's changed, he's grown. I feel closure, not really sure for whom. He leaves.

For the next two days, I can't stop thinking about fucking him. This innocent, nerdy, lame dude just holding me up against the wall, my legs around his waist, fucking me, with years of pent-up attraction, just wanting me. Maybe I wanted him to want me and now I can't have that. Maybe I just wanted to feel some kind of power over him. I don't know. I don't care. Whatever it was, it was great spank material.

ISTJ,"Till date , I was classified as an INTJ. I had taken the MBTI test 2 years back. Today , I retake the test , and I am now ISTJ.  Thus was kinda surprising. Does our character change with time  ? Or is it possible that I have both of these characteristics ( my weak trait Ni is approx  50% , along with Si)?",1530538869
ISTJ,"I had a friend who I am very confident is an ISTJ. After 2 years of being really close friends with him, I realised that he is a pretty sensitive guy. I am as well, possibly more so than him, but when I am hurt by something I rarely ever show it, (because I realise I shouldn't be) and when I do, I try to explain it in an up front way. He, however will always show it, but does not say it straight up and will not explain why.

He is 17, so he is not near the most mature an ISTJ can be, but is this something any of you relate to? I am asking because I don't see this as a stereotypical ISTJ trait, but I also can't imagine him being any other type.",1530444356

ISTJ,"Hello, ISTJ's.

Since I took the test, I got kinda obsessed with MBTI, I've been reading a lot about different personalities, seeing how each would apply to me, and comparing them to my INTJ results. 

I have taken multiple tests from different sites, because I've read that some sites are very inaccurate. I would always get INTJ, once it suggested INFJ (but I'm 100% sure that I'm not INFJ), and one test concluded I'm an ISTJ. I'm not sure if it's accurate at all and it's been bugging me since. The test wasn't asking any questions, rather it was letting me pick words that describe my personality.

So, I've read about ISTJ's and, I relate more to being intuitive rather than sensory. My memory is shit, I forget things easily, history doesn't interest me, I think about the future, I live inside my head, etc.

So, I came to the conclusion that I'm not ISTJ, I've read that lots of ISTJ's mistype as being INTJ, so I just want to be 100% sure before I move on comparing to another personality type.

Maybe you want to ask me some questions or just have something to say that will help me.

Thank you for reading.",1530174768
ISTJ,"We‚Äôre a trope. He‚Äôs like the successful lame nerdy dude and I‚Äôm his manic pixie dream girl. I feel like he sees me as this risk-taking burnout whose life is fun and interesting but at the same time he looks down on me for that. Like he feels superior to me. I always felt like he was this‚Ä¶ puppy tailing me around sometimes, but even that‚Äôs an inaccurate analogy. 

I don‚Äôt like or dislike him. I definitely don‚Äôt like his friends, though. Even though I let them stay in my dorm and stored their shit for a week, the impression I get from hanging out with them is, ‚Äúwhy does he hang out with her?‚Äù They‚Äôre all condescending ivy leagues who always try to one-up you like rich snobs. They were so disrespectful and ungrateful after I did those favors for them. I should‚Äôve just thrown their shit out in the street. That‚Äôs what I told him and so I never hung out with his friends again. He‚Äôs kind of like that, too. A little condescending, and like I said, it‚Äôs like he sees me as a loser burnout because I‚Äôm not as high-achieving as him or his friends. But whatever. I don‚Äôt care what he thinks of me at all, so I guess that‚Äôs why I let shit like that slide. But he always wants to hear about my life, and if it‚Äôs not interesting or shocking enough, he gets annoyed and pushes me further. He uses my life as entertainment, and that pisses me off. It‚Äôs like he‚Äôs trying to live vicariously through me, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs his fault but rather his repressed and structured upbringing and being around people like his friends and family. That‚Äôs why he‚Äôs drawn to me, and I know that because every time I ask him why we‚Äôre friends, he says that he finds me and my life fascinating. Because I‚Äôm so different from what he‚Äôs used to. I find that sad, in a sympathetic way, so I don‚Äôt feel like I should be as annoyed at him as I get. It‚Äôs clear that even though he looks down on me, he wants to be my friend, he wants to be in my life, and he wants me to like him. Not attraction like, just like as a person.

We‚Äôve had a lot of moments where it was obvious he had a crush on me, and he admitted that a few times. I just kind of let it be because I made it clear where I stood about that, and he accepted that. I remember him needing a place to crash for a night and I loaned my room. I remember coming back at 4AM, knocking out on the bed and waking up to him kissing my cheek. He‚Äôs been with his girlfriend for years now and has a promise ring, and plans to buy a house in LA and have a future with her. But in the past, even though he was with his girlfriend, I still felt a kind of yearning for my attention from him. He used to be super touchy and kind of flirty with me throughout this time. We only hung out like a handful of times over like six years now, but each time felt kind of heavy with emotion in a way. When he told me he was moving to Seattle, I cried. It felt like it was out of nowhere and I surprised even myself with my reaction. Like I‚Äôve had plenty of friends, closer to me than him, where I was like ‚Äúalright bye‚Äù when they moved away. When I cried, he put his hand on my mouth and kissed the back of my hand. 

I feel like I‚Äôve read this fictional story a million times before and seen it end every type of way. What‚Äôs most interesting, though, is that I feel the story changing. This time, when he mentioned what he felt when he first met me, he didn‚Äôt describe it as a crush like he usually did. He changed his mind and said it was more of a strong fascination. And I felt really.. profoundly happy in a way. That he was changing and growing, and that our story was changing. It was breaking out of the trope, I guess.

Even after seeing him as this kind of safe dude who never acts outside of the way he‚Äôs supposed to act, his personality is so rich and interesting and nuanced, and so is our relationship. Despite all the things that never happened and never will happen, I feel such deep, intense feelings about us.",1530153799
ISTJ,"Im a male INTJ. I have a crush on what I believe to be an ISTJ female coworker. We don't really work together but we do end up in the same places for short periods of time here and there. She forces a small smile when I run into her and when I'm around her she avoids eye contact and leaves my area quickly. I've made her blush by asking if she needed help before. I struck up conversation with her once when we were practically locked in the same room by telling her I got promoted, and she got pretty excited and started asking me lots of questions and her voice went up an octave (she rarely does this, even around her friends). Despite making conversation, she still avoids me.

TL;DR

How do I make a shy ISTJ feel like she can initiate conversation with me and generally feel more comfortable around me? I'd love to build some kind of rapport with her. Is small talk effective with you guys?",1530080681
ISTJ,"I‚Äôm (19F ENFP) currently in a stable relationship with a ISTJ (21M). About an hour ago, I was over at his place when a male friend of mine texted me. My ISTJ saw the messages (nothing sexual but it was random, no previous chat history), he asked me who was it, and whether I have this friend‚Äôs Facebook/instagram to show him the friend‚Äôs picture. I said I don‚Äôt as I‚Äôm not really close with this Friend and I do not know why did he texted me so suddenly. Even the content is random I don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs going on. 

He instantly went silent and I asked whether he‚Äôs jealous/mad, but he denied it (not in a angry way). I could sense that he was slightly unhappy. I‚Äôm not sure whether I‚Äôm overthinking but I‚Äôm prone to it. We didn‚Äôt quarrel over it and he took it like nothing happened. I kept assuring him that I‚Äôm not cheating on him etc and he said ok. 

Am I overthinking and should I take his words as it is? How can I assure him that‚Äôs he‚Äôs the only one for me? This is the first time something like this happened.

ISTJ,"Hey there. Lately I‚Äôve been confused by this istj‚Äôs behaviour. We were going out and I‚Äôm trying to understand what‚Äôs going on.

Being an ISTP, I kinda suck at dating. So I‚Äôm here asking you for help.

So ISTJ and I were going out. He‚Äôs a textbook ISTJ. We had the same values and a good common ground. We both loved spending time together. He was surprisingly romantic underneath the surface. He was very kind and showed his feelings through action which I loved. We talked all the time. Then after a couple months, he sits me down to have a ‚Äútalk.‚Äù And he tells me we can‚Äôt see each other anymore because he‚Äôs going away to work for the summer and he has had horrible past experiences with long distance. He said maybe things can work in the fall if things line up right. He doesn‚Äôt instability it stressed him out. I was like ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt you already know you were going away before we started going out?‚Äù And he goes ‚ÄúYes but I really liked you. Hard decision for me to make but it‚Äôs the logical thing to do.‚Äù And it did make sense. Long distance is hard. I respected his decision but got all awkward cause of the emotional tension so I asked him to leave. He asked if he could kiss me one last time and I said no because he led me on and I told him we can‚Äôt be friends either. Cause once it‚Äôs done, it done. He was like ‚Äúoh..‚Äù and looked like he was really upset. 

A week later, he starts texting me random things that ‚Äúreminded him of me‚Äù such an Arabic piece of art. I‚Äôm middle eastern. Then he called me out of no where and asked me to meet him so I could help him return his books to the library. Who needs help to do that?? He would tell me about his summer plans and how he‚Äôs coming back to school in the fall. I kept the conversations short and I was polite but uncomfortable. He was also in my home town passing through and told me he was there. He said he wanted to return to visit it sometime. 

He hasn‚Äôt contacted me lately, as he is now abroad. I had a feeling he wouldn‚Äôt contact me while he‚Äôs abroad since he has poor phone service. He‚Äôs also doing labour pretty much 24/7. 

I don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs going on. Why text me like this?? He said it didn‚Äôt make sense for him to date me due to him going away, so why continue to contact me?? Especially when I said I didn‚Äôt want to remain friends. ",1529884040
ISTJ,"Thanks for contributing! I'm interested in hearing what you think.

My office has a culture of showing up late and leaving early. We're paid hourly, and in my mind I'm going to put in my eight hours each day. So this is exactly what bothers me, arriving early and leaving late, and I'm wondering if it has to do with personality? I simply can't ""let it go"".

Here's the thing: my manager and supervisor are both okay with us sometimes coming in late or leaving early. What's nice about this is having a flexible schedule and we get treated like adults. No one really cares as long as we get our work done.

I can let go of a lot of things that go on at the office, but I see showing up late and leaving early almost like being lazy. It really bothers me, and on top of that I sometimes feel resentment because I'm there almost all day and some folks show up for as little as 3-4 hours at times. I feel like that's almost abusing the privilege, and I simply cannot wrap my head around the fact that some people feel like it's okay to put down eight hours when they've only shown up for part of that. 

I've been working there for years, and you think I would have assimilated by now. I simply cannot help feeling guilty if I show up late or leave early like the others. On top of that, sometimes I feel angry and resentful at others because they waltz in hours late and leave early, and no one with management cares. I tell myself I need to let it go, and also start doing what the others are doing, but I simply cannot. 

I wonder if a lot of this has to do with ISTJ personalities being ""duty fulfillers""? ",1529583364
ISTJ,"We‚Äôve been together for about 3 months (I know, not long) but we clicked INSTANTLY. Truly, I feel like I‚Äôve found ‚Äúthe one‚Äù and have never been so amazed by a human being before.

He hasn‚Äôt given me any indication  of this, of course, but as he isn‚Äôt emotional either, how can I tap into his feelings for him to communicate them more? I think I‚Äôm seeking more reassurance as I‚Äôm trying to always move things forward but don‚Äôt want to rush him, as things so far have already gone a bit faster than I think he‚Äôs used to.

ISTJ,"Can anyone shed any light on this? My boyfriend basically told me that with his ex wife there were a lot of little issues over things and he said he thinks some of our issues are the same.

I have been TRYING to get to a place where I can run a 5k, but he said that he wants to be with someone that would already be doing that.

We met online, on a forum, and he messaged me asking how I was feeling and if I was doing better. (I made a thread about my crappy day.)

ISTJ,"Hi again. I was here a few weeks ago asking about my istj (32) husband, and I'm back needing more help. 

He broke it to me shortly after I posted here (like days) that he wants to leave me. It's been a huge struggle to get anything in order because I'm an emotional processor and he is a logical one. I'm trying to find a place and move on and he can't even give me a simple answer for anything; he just tries to make himself seem like a hero and I'm so unappreciative and uses this condescending tone. 

I know my thought process is emotional, and I try really, really hard to just communicate, but he says things in a way that feels like he's trying to hurt me more, and make me feel bad for being emotional. I'm heartbroken and lost; I can't help it. He's avoiding me every chance he gets. 

I know not all istjs act like this, but I also know you are known for processing things logically. I really need help in how to navigate this. We both don't want lawyers involved for monetary reasons. I'm suffering sever depression and really can't handle this stress involved with that anyway. ",1529344978

ISTJ,"Okay, so someone at work asked me my MBTI yesterday and this was something I had never really considered before but it totally explains some issues my boyfriend and I have. I am basically ""too much"" for him sometimes and he just totally withdrawls from me and I drive him nuts with my thinking and overthinking and long messages and explanations. I have started to try meditating and taking a page out of his book and just totally loading myself up with things to do, or just being really mindful about how he feels about what I'm about to do before I dump all of my thoughts onto him. I am an INTP and I would ordinarily say that I am 100&amp;#37; INTP, but dating a guy with kids has pushed me a tad closer into INFP territory, I think. I feel like the overall experience with his kids has changed me somehow, but it's not over the top, it's just slightly noticeable. Anyway, I really can't get over how much this explains, because I plan fun trips for us with all kinds of stuff he's never done before and he enjoys himself but it's never quite the reaction I am looking for, or I get him little things and he's just annoyed by it, but he gets me pocket knives because I run alone at night, a toilet light because I pee in the dark at night, and a screwdriver set with smaller screw bit things because mine is bigger... that was the most interesting Christmas I've ever had.

So, about him, he is 39, been divorced twice, last was 2 years ago. He has 3 kids and has been going through a custody battle since his divorce which just finished 2 months ago. He had primary custody at first but now it is 50/50. He is a physician and in the army. He just told me this week that he is not happy. I think he feels like a failure. He is going to have to give his ex child support which is being worked out, he has to choose between being in the army or completely missing out on a lot of time with his kids which was vastly different when he was with his ex, he is in a lot of debt from the lawyers from all of this being dragged out, he had a lot of plans for the future that got messed up when she left him. Oh, and she cheated on him, refused to accompany him and the kids on a deployment and quite literally stole the kids and kept him away from them for over a month.

Anyway, he has a lot of issues in his life and I put myself into fixer mode for some of it and I think it started to drive him nuts. I have stopped giving him so much advice because I think he is so overwhelmed and mostly just wants to vent to me. I really, really heard him when he said he wasn't happy and I want to do everything in my power to do that for him. And I think I finally get that, for him, that is just somehow making his life easier. His life is very complicated. I used to help him clean, cook, and do things around the house even though we don't live together. I know he appreciated it because it drives him nuts when things are messy, but I also think it annoyed him because it was like his thing and he wasn't doing a good job or something. But, his ex was a stay at home mom and now he has a huge house and 3 kids and lots of shit to do alone!

So, today I put what I learned into practice. I was going to give him a fun father's day present, but yesterday he was bitching to me about the disorder of his pots and pans in the pantry and that is was somewhat distressing to him. I dropped off his gift with a little note basically saying that I have had an epiphany and a very small summary of my understanding of the situation and I hope that he enjoys this gift for once. As I gave it to him, he was like, ""you're not supposed to give me crap anymore..."" but I think he was pleasantly surprised. At least I think. Anyway, I left very quickly because this was a somewhat surprise visit and he sometimes doesn't like those.

ANYWAY, what little things can I do to make his life easier? Does anyone have any tips? I am totally willing to do any and everything you guys suggest and my man deserves the world. For example, he loads himself up on chores when the kids are with their mom. Sometimes I think he totally forgets about me. And lately I have offered just basically a booty call and he will squeeze me in for that but it gets to the point where he can't even relax and sit next to me because he has to go do something. The other day I went over to his house under the ruse of baking something and I left an ingredient at his place. I ended up baking for like 2 hours, and he finished his stuff from work, did a little bit of chores, and he had a dresser he had to put together for his daughter so I ended up helping him with that and then we just went to bed. I think that was a really good night, but if I had asked him to come over he would have said he was busy, but I kind of snuck myself in there. Another thing is that he doesn't want to spend money right now but he feels bad when I buy everything, but like, sometimes I want to do SOMETHING that costs money and I'm the one offering because I want to do it WITH HIM. Is there some way that I should be saying this better or suggesting things?",1529187844

ISTJ,"I'm an INTJ female and have been talking to this male ISTJ I met for a few months.

We initially began talking because we were partners in class and I started to become aware that he would not leave the classroom until I left and then would be right behind me not saying anything at all. Then, one day we were talking about something as class ended and he ended up walking me to my car and it became an unspoken routine for the entire semester even if we were not talking about anything. In fact, the two times I broke the routine, he gave me this look and I decided that he did not like that and I never did it again.

I wanted to get to know him better and I figured like we were not going to get anywhere if I didn't initiate things with him. So eventually, I asked him to go to the school diner with me (just as friends) and this became part of my unspoken routine with him where we would go out at least once a week. 

One day he asked me what I thought about him (like first impressions) and I told him a variety of things and included how I thought he was a sweet guy.

I came to that last conclusion because it felt like he was always courting me or at least trying to. So the next time I saw him in person he was acting different and I figured that he did not want to be the ""sweet guy"".

Eventually, he reverted back to normal, but in our later interactions, he randomly began to talk about how he really liked tall women (I am not tall) and even started pointing out random girls when we would be out just because they are tall. One time there was a girl walking with heels on and he just like stood still and checked her out. In fact, like he went into detail about his ideal woman and like I just don't fit anywhere in his list especially personality wise (submissive). 

I figured maybe he was trying to send a message to me due to the randomness of it and I left it that. For whatever reason, he stopped doing this. If I tell him I don't like something, he responds with very few words, however, his behavior changes and he kind of acts like nothing ever happened.

Now when we go out, he tries to make up reasons why he should cover everything and will insist unless I roll my eyes, sometimes it almost seems as if he is mimicking my behavior, and he is always staring to the point where I start to feel a little nervous so I try not to notice and I end up laughing.

I would like to hear from him more often, but he's a really busy guy and takes forever to respond to texts (I've recently learned that it's probably partly because his phone is in airplane mode).

Despite being very different people, I just feel close to him, like sometimes we just ""get"" each other. Is he just being friendly?

ISTJ,"disclaimer: i have no way of asking this question without coming off as a huge douche bag. I'm not trying to be. tl;dr at the bottom

I'm a very logical person. I like facts and I like knowing all the facts. in the recent past I've been really working on owning up to when I'm wrong (factually) and knowing when the argument at hand is about opinions and while I'm not wrong, it's okay to try to understand the other persons perspective. It's a nice thing to work on and I enjoy it.

But not everyone does this. I deal with my family members whose arguments about anything (from net neutrality to what types of cars to drive) stems entirely from their political opinions and bias. I deal with them being unable to be honest about things (such as diet, health, exercise) and I'm sitting there thinking ""Theres no way I'm right this often. There's no way my family and friends are wrong so often."" I just see people around me do such stupid and hypocritical things and it's hard to be 100% objective and logic based, but i really try my hardest. And I think I do really well. Is it possible that I'm right as often as I think I am? I try to take into account the facts that I know, the experiences I have had, the experiences I have heard from others, and try to leave opinions, temptations, and emotions out of it. And I'm right a lot. Not all the time, but a lot. And things like hubris, and people being over confident. I just want to make sure I'm right, instead of thinking I'm right because of my own bias.

Does anyone relate to this?

Examples since this question is probably pretty stupid and random:

-Texting and driving is bad, even if you're not explicitly texting (checking the time, changing songs)

-Eating healthy. I am very health oriented, I have gotten my bloodwork done many times, I have altered my diet accordingly. I try to eat healthy diet in terms of micros and macros. My brother does not. He hasnt gotten his bloodwork done, he eats unhealthy. Some days he says ""Oh i dont eat like this all the time/Its just a treat/Everything in moderations."" and other days he says ""Whats the point of living if youre not going to enjoy it?/You only live once. I'm gonna eat what I want."" (translation: example 1 is ""i dont eat unhealthy all the time. Example 2: ""I eat unhealthy all the time but thats because i enjoy it and yolo"")

-Calories and weight. I have 0 issue not eating. I was skinny all my life, but in the past few years have been bulking to build muscle. I do it as healthily as possible, and it works. I weigh myself every day. I track my calories, each gram of food. It works. I have undeniably proven to myself that counting calories works. My dad has been trying to lose weight since I started gaining weight. He hasnt been successful. He refuses to weigh himself ""in case its gone up, then I get discouraged."" He's tracked a calories a few time and it worked, he says, but he stopped because its too much work. He swears carbs are evil despite this. However, only when convenient. If he orders no fries and they give him fries, he'll eat them. Just today he got KFC for lunch, ordered the grilled chicken, got fried instead. He ate it no problem, and had a klondike bar for dessert. ""Carbs are evil"" he says, but eats cake, cookies, ice cream, chocolate, on the regular. 

-Playing online games with friends. One friend always pushes the idea to try hard. Then when I want to take the time to go into a custom game and work on our callouts, coordination, and grenades, he says ""nah"". Hypocritical.

In these situations, I feel I am on the side of logic and facts. It feels like my friends and family are on the side of bias and crazy opinions. Am I wrong here? 

-Brother is major conservative, agrees with everything trump says and does, disagrees with anything a ""libtard"" says. Because liberals were trying to keep net neutrality (NN), he was entirely on the side of Ajit Pai and the FCC. We spent hours a day arguing about it. Me with facts, him with some facts and mostly logical fallacies fueled by political bias. I tried to understand his perspective, why he thought getting rid of NN was a good idea. But his arguments were full of holes. At one point he made this argument, and I quote (from a text he sent me) ""But if you look at how it grew from the 90s to 2015. Verses now. It's a big difference. Ignore the length of time. But the changes. There isn't really a whole lot since 2015."" He actually tried to argue that NN was bad because the internet grew much more since it's birth to 25 years after its birth, compared to in the last 3 years. 

tl;dr
Idk I guess I'm looking for validation but past that, does anyone else ever have the thought of ""How am I right this often? Surely I'm missing something. Surely they're correct and I'm just not seeing it. There's no way I'm right.""

ISTJ,"I've been seeing this one guy for two dates now, and he seems like a sweet guy. Good-looking, proper, well-dressed, kind, and a twinge of snarkiness that I appreciate. But I find that talking with him at the beginning of our dates is a little awkward, maybe even forced, but by the end of the date it feels more natural and enjoyable. 

As the years have passed, I've found it increasingly difficult for me to determine whether I like someone. If I like someone from the first date (sparks flying, etc.) it goes sour within a month. With this person, I'm not sure if I even like him, but potentially worth it to keep seeing.

I can only think of a few things that I want:

- A compact headset for when I'm not home (I prefer headsets over earbuds but I'd need a small bag / backpack for them)

- A butterfly knife because they're neat

- A high end watch because I'm sort of into watches, but it's something I won't be able to afford for many years to come.

ISTJ,"I'm typing this while I'm at a hospital (accompanying mom for her checkup), where I am surrounded by thousands of strangers, and I am wearing particular set of clothes that **purposefully** fit the occasion and place as opposed to wearing clothes at home for the sole purpose of covering my body.  

And, I don't feel depressed, sad, lonely, and weak - *at all*. I feel great, well functioning, and healthy; I feel like myself. I feel motivated and productive!

However, when I'm home, I feel depressed, sad, lonely, and weak - **not** myself. I get suicidal thoughts. If I stay in my home for too long this ""depression"" takes over me. 

The ""depression"" is mainly caused by the recent end of a friendship with someone I had been very emotionally invested on. I long for her, I grieve, and I sometimes cry. I feel emotionally traumatized, afraid to make friends, afraid of loss. Yet I crave social interaction (but only online, because too long IRL socialization would exhaust me). Nothing makes me happy, but chatting with people online.

However, right now while I'm here at the hospital, or just anywhere outside of my house, I don't feel any pain. I don't think I need a therapist. Sure, I still fucking miss her, but I'm more emotionally intelligent and tough that I don't even feel the pain. I'm a sheer fucking healthy human being, I am.

It's like the moment I step foot outside my house, I magically transform into the real me. I return home and poof, I'm the sad, weak, and dependent suicidal me. It's as if my front door is a fucking portal, where the fake me switches places and summons the real me to this world when I go out.

Can anybody please explain what in the fuck is going on here? Why am I like this? Am I truly depressed? How do I bring ""my real self"" with me inside my house? How do I fuse this seemingly duality in my identity? Help me understand.",1523065933

And no matter what hobby or task you do, you can't find that one thing that fits that void. It remains empty and begs to be filled, but you don't know what to do about it.

ISTJ,"All of my friends and employees are Ns, so I'd appreciate any suggestions you have on managing an ISTJ. I'm an INTJ, so I tend to be blunt, direct, logical, and am very open book about my business and my decision making process with all employees. 

My ISTJ came from a job where the boss was very hands off and absent; I want to train him further and help him advance his technical skill without micromanaging or seeming overbearing. 

He is more experienced than the employees I've hired in the past, but is coming from a company with... well... lower standards and a so-so reputation, so I will definitely be working to help him level up. 

I am especially unclear on ""sensing"" and what the hell it means. So far, I understand that he does not think abstractly, about the big picture, or theoretically. Sensors just focus on the concrete present. Does that mean you are literally thinking ""Here I am walking down the street! Now I will use my left hand to turn this doorknob counterclockwise and enter this room!""? I apologize if that seems absurd, but can't guess what else it might mean. 

Finally, he has very unusual religious beliefs. My (INTP) top employee assumed this meant he couldn't possibly be a T, since anyone who follows ghosts/mysticism/mythology is obviously illogical, but in my reading, I have learned that ISTJs enjoy rules, traditions and order, so perhaps he pretends to believe in order to participate in something that adds extra rules to his life...? Obviously, I know this topic is off limits in any workplace and have carefully coached my staff never to bring this up and to avoid making him feel out of place or uneasy due to his personal beliefs and religious practices, but I'd like to know if there is anything else I should know or do about this besides watching my tongue. 

TL;DR: INTJ business owner with only N employees seeks advice on being a great boss to help ISTJ who has strange religious beliefs advance his professional skills and feel comfortable/happy/accepted at work. ",1522275633

ISTJ,"Hello so I am an INFP, I think very differently from you guys.

I have been confused by an ISTJ's intentions because you guys are supposed to be incredibly consistent and yet, this person is shown me quite the opposite.

The ISTJ reduced me to the past in December of 2016. Long story short, I had wanted to reconnect with the ISTJ and the ISTJ said there was really no need because he had ""new friends and had moved on."" Of course I was crushed, my feelings were not reciprocated and I felt invalidated. Harsh words were exchanged and it took me until August to apologize. We were on bad terms, but he accepted my apology and I decided that I should leave things like that.

In October of last year he had reached out to me asking how I was doing while he was intoxicated. I was quite confused because he had told me that I was a part of his past and yet he struck up a conversation about me, kind of implying that he still cared about me and was wondering what I was up to.

I did not take the conversation well and questioned whether he meant to text me. The ISTJ was not receptive and we did not talk after that. Come December/January and the ISTJ struck up two conversations with me. These conversations were relatively long and naturally flowed. It seemed as if no time has past and he did not bring up the fight we had a year prior. I thought this was strange because again, this is the third time he reached out unprompted after telling me he did not want to be friends or anything.

A couple of days later he added two my closest friends on a social media app that you usually don't add people you are not friends with on. When one of my friends questioned who he was, he cited that he was friends with me. I again am very confused because I have not seen him in nearly two years and we have not talked long enough to warrant a friendship?

So it's been two months since I've heard from him and I'd really like to ask his intentions. I am not sure how highly ISTJs value friendship, but I personally see friendship as being something more than just exchanging a couple of text messages a year. In all honesty, the concept of being ""friends"" with this person is only two months old and we have not been in the same state for very long (I attend a neighboring state college).

I know you will probably say this is too long (I am faulted) but to be direct I was wondering if this is typical of ISTJs because you guys come across as so consistent/direct and yet this person is everything but? I would also like to talk about why he suddenly wants to be ""friends"" after he reduced me to the past, but I don't wanna say it too direct because I fear that will scare him off or cause a fight? Do you guys have any suggestions?",1522031774
ISTJ,"For the longest time, I‚Äôve seen myself as an ISTJ. However, some comments from friends lately have made me reconsider. As an ISTJ, the T seems to fit me. I tend to make logical decisions before involving the feelings of myself or others; however, I do definitely consider them. I will confront someone to solve a problem but overall I dislike discord (but doesn‚Äôt everyone?). The cognitive stack makes sense as well. I can totally see the Te - when I‚Äôm put in a leadership position, I can easily organize everyone to develop a good and efficient outcome. Sometimes, I tend to get a bit carried away trying to organize everything and make it perfect that I will forego others‚Äô feelings without realizing it - however, when I do realize it, I always feel awful about it. I also tend to be very Type A. I can also see the Fi - I tend to keep my feelings inside to most people, although to my closest friends I will let my true emotions show more. Based on all of this, an ISTJ makes the most sense. However, I seem to possess some qualities of an ISFJ as well (or maybe I‚Äôm mistyping myself). I‚Äôm known as the ‚Äúmom‚Äù friend because I‚Äôm always making sure that my friends have eaten, gotten enough sleep, etc; when they haven‚Äôt, I‚Äôll give them some food or offer my car and a blanket for a nap during lunch (I‚Äôm in high school). My friend said the other day that whenever she mentions my name to anyone, their first reaction is always ‚ÄúOh, she‚Äôs so nice!‚Äù I can maybe see parts of the cognitive stack in me, but they‚Äôre inconsistent and I think that I relate to the ISTJ stack more. All things considered, I know that I‚Äôm young and probably don‚Äôt know myself or haven‚Äôt become my true self yet; however, I‚Äôd really be interested in learning what type others think I am.

Below is an overview of the Big 5 for those who are unfamiliar.

-----

[*From wikipedia:*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits)

&gt; * **Openness** to experience (inventive/curious vs. consistent/cautious)  
Appreciation for art, emotion, adventure, unusual ideas, curiosity, and variety of experience. Openness reflects the degree of intellectual curiosity, creativity and a preference for novelty and variety a person has. It is also described as the extent to which a person is imaginative or independent and depicts a personal preference for a variety of activities over a strict routine. High openness can be perceived as unpredictability or lack of focus, and more likely to engage in risky behaviour or drug taking. Also, individuals that have high openness tend to lean towards being artists or writers in regards to being creative and appreciate the significance of the intellectual and artistic pursuits. Moreover, individuals with high openness are said to pursue self-actualization specifically by seeking out intense, euphoric experiences. Conversely, those with low openness seek to gain fulfillment through perseverance and are characterized as pragmatic and data-driven‚Äîsometimes even perceived to be dogmatic and closed-minded. Some disagreement remains about how to interpret and contextualize the openness factor.

&gt;* **Conscientiousness** (efficient/organized vs. easy-going/careless)  
A tendency to be organized and dependable, show self-discipline, act dutifully, aim for achievement, and prefer planned rather than spontaneous behavior. High conscientiousness is often perceived as stubbornness and obsession. Low conscientiousness is associated with flexibility and spontaneity, but can also appear as sloppiness and lack of reliability.

&gt;* **Extraversion** (outgoing/energetic vs. solitary/reserved)  
Energy, positive emotions, surgency, assertiveness, sociability and the tendency to seek stimulation in the company of others, and talkativeness. High extraversion is often perceived as attention-seeking, and domineering. Low extraversion causes a reserved, reflective personality, which can be perceived as aloof or self-absorbed. Extroverted people tend to be more dominant in social settings, opposed to introverted people who may act more shy and reserved in this setting.

&gt;* **Agreeableness** (friendly/compassionate vs. challenging/detached)  
A tendency to be compassionate and cooperative rather than suspicious and antagonistic towards others. It is also a measure of one's trusting and helpful nature, and whether a person is generally well-tempered or not. High agreeableness is often seen as naive or submissive. Low agreeableness personalities are often competitive or challenging people, which can be seen as argumentativeness or untrustworthiness.

&gt;* **Neuroticism** (sensitive/nervous vs. secure/confident)  
Neuroticism identifies certain people who are more prone to psychological stress. The tendency to experience unpleasant emotions easily, such as anger, anxiety, depression, and vulnerability. Neuroticism also refers to the degree of emotional stability and impulse control and is sometimes referred to by its low pole, ""emotional stability"". A high stability manifests itself as a stable and calm personality, but can be seen as uninspiring and unconcerned. A low stability expresses as a reactive and excitable personality, often very dynamic individuals, but they can be perceived as unstable or insecure. It has also been researched that individuals with higher levels of tested neuroticism, tend to have worse psychological well being.

[*From a peer-reviewed paper:*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0191886996000335):

&gt;The NEO-PI Agreeableness score was correlated only with the thinking-feeling (T-F) dimension; the NEO-PI Conscientiousness score was correlated with both thinking-feeling and judging-perceiving (J-P) dimension; the NEO-PI Extraversion score was strongly correlated with the extraversion-introversion (E-I) dimensions, while the Neuroticism score from the NEO-PI was not related to any MBTI subscale score. The openness dimension was correlated with all four especially sensing-intuitive.",1521894417
ISTJ,"I'm having a bit of a rough time - Basically I find myself with too much unstructured time on the weekends, which leads me down a dark and spiraling rabbit hole.  During the week I work full-time, have classes two nights a week, and usually see the boyfriend one evening, so I'm pretty tuckered out and busy which leaves me no time to dwell.  

But on weekends, I simply feel like moping around and doing nothing.  On really bad days I spiral into the ""my boyfriend hates me... he doesn't talk to me enough.  What is he doing?  Why doesn't he want to be doing it with me"".  That being said, when I didn't have a boyfriend I spiraled into ""what am I doing with my life.  I should be doing something productive, blah blah blah"" or the ""I have no friends.  If I get married who will I invite.  I will die alone and my cats will eat my body"", so it's not really a relationship question... that's just currently what I'm dwelling on because it's there to dwell on, even though it's entirely irrational. 

I could and should do homework, I should do household upkeep... but mostly I just feeling like sitting around and moping. 

So... how do you spend your time?  What captures your attention so completely that you don't realize hours have passed?  I think I'm severely lacking in things to do.  Or rather, things I want to do.  That which used to hold my interest just doesn't anymore. ",1521861063

I'd probably just stand there to analyze everything being said, then pack my stuff and leave with a straight face.

I get suicidal thoughts, which I 100% know I won't ever actually do due to lack of convenient suicide method. Okay, maybe an 8 out of 10 probability I might just jump to death in the future. Whatever.

The pain doesn't come only when I dig those memories. I'm terrified of the possibility of experiencing that pain again, that I have become more paranoid and extremely untrustworthy of everyone.

ISTJ,"Istj male and I sometimes get along really well. We can talk for hours and it seems like we just naturally click. Because this doesn‚Äôt happen for me with a lot of people, I decided to start trying to make an effort to get to know him and it‚Äôs all gone downhill from here. 

At school, I just have tunnel vision because there‚Äôs a lot to do and I‚Äôm not really concerned about anything else besides accomplishing what I need to do. So I didn‚Äôt notice initially that he would kind of linger around me after class, as if he was waiting or something, following me out, and then started engaging me in conversation long enough to walk me to my car. I wasn‚Äôt off put by any of this, I thought that maybe he was just being friendly or had a tiny crush for whatever reason but it wasn‚Äôt a big deal.

What‚Äôs confusing is that we both study CS and when we have to work together on solving a problem if I‚Äôm right about something, he‚Äôll get really flustered, and  or/ passive agressive or go on mini rants/tangents, or begin to like try and dominate the conversation even though I‚Äôm not going out of my way to point out he was wrong. In fact, I openly admit when I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing and I‚Äôll even ask him questions to clarify things. And if I see something that‚Äôs wrong, I‚Äôll provide a solution to make it right. I never just say ‚Äúyou‚Äôre wrong‚Äù. In fact, I never do because it seems like he‚Äôs sensitive to this. 

I don‚Äôt even know how to respond to these moments. So, I don‚Äôt upfront, I just remain cool. Other times, in the corner of my eye, he‚Äôs like staring at me for whatever reason.  

I realized that he‚Äôs really judgemental. So there will be moments where he will make comments as if assuming I‚Äôm judging him or others based on like clothes, or the food they eat, the way they study, whether they choose to study or not, ect. When in reality I could care less. And I‚Äôll try to communicate that to him by saying things like ‚Äú it‚Äôs not a big deal‚Äù and ‚Äúpeople will people‚Äù. But after listening to these judgements, I‚Äôve started to wonder if he‚Äôs judging me to the death too, which makes me not want to be around him. 

Last week, because in class he‚Äôs an asshole but then lingers around me. I figured that he didn‚Äôt want to talk to me anymore but maybe felt like he had to out of habit or something. So I just left at the end of class to try and make things easy but he ran out behind me and looked hurt that I didn‚Äôt wait. 

Later in the week I text him about hanging out over the weekend and he said ‚Äúyeah sure!‚Äù but then when I started text back to figure out he‚Äôs schedule there was no response. In fact, when I do text him he gives really short responses or like takes 6 hours to respond. And I purposely put myself out there because like I figured someone has to, it seemed okay because he started texting me first, and I‚Äôve tried to be direct with him about if I‚Äôm annoying him or not and he‚Äôs always like ‚Äúnobody text me, you‚Äôre not annoying me.‚Äù 

So once again I figured that maybe he didn‚Äôt want to hangout but didn‚Äôt want to just say no. Which is irritating because then I feel like I have to continue ‚Äúread between the lines‚Äù. Sometimes I come to class not as like extraverted with him as usual, because if I am stressed out like being unnaturally extraverted just so we don‚Äôt have to be silent this can be exhausting overtime. 

And now like the overall hot/cold, indirectness, the lingering, trying to be a little more extraverted, is all exhausting for me so this week I just left without saying a word. But today, I decided to look over and back and he was just staring at me as I left and because we made eye contact I gave him a wave goodbye, but I couldn‚Äôt smile because there‚Äôs nothing to smile about. 

I think I also feel weird about being under his judgment. He kind has like this superiority complex due to studying math and CS. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love studying CS. But I don‚Äôt necessarily view anyone studying anything else as inferior or even like other subjects like inferior. I just admire and respect when people have passion for whatever they do. 

What am I missing here? What does he want from me ?  ",1521078836
ISTJ,"Hi all, so glad to come across this community! Would like some advice... Recently found out I‚Äôm ENFP, (Gemini female)  I am back in a relationship with an ISTJ (Virgo male) we were a couple 10 years ago and have got back together in our 30s as we have always remained close, despite living in different countries for 5 years, and share a great friendship and respect for each other. (the most important things long term?) We have been there for each other through a lot. We had a brilliant relationship back then but i fear now what was ying and yang is butting heads üò£ we have a very different outlook and little things become big things that go in circles. His lack of apparent enthusiasm for things Im passionate about can seem dismissive and hurtful to me.I feel he views me as kind of childish, due to my lighter approach to life and liberal nature. On the other hand I find sometimes his single minded obsessions and attention to detail over insignificant crap a little boring! Then there‚Äôs the differences in how we express ourselves... I‚Äôm aware we are polar opposite personality types - which is a relief to know as I can understand his anal perfectionism and him my flouncy fickleness. we work so well together when it comes to advice and support, we share a similar humour and offer stability to the other in lots of ways. He feels safe to me, and I relieve the intensity of life for him. I love and care about him a lot. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd ever find someone who could love me more or want to care for me as much....thing is, chemistry is a little off. Or a lot off. There is basically f all. We are both attractive people, i appreciate that. I just don‚Äôt feel that spark. We have both made HuGE sacrifices to give this a go ( moved country and given up a very good career) so this is a massive disappointment to us both. Has anyone else found this? Is it something that can be worked on, and how?? or are we just TOO poles apart and understanding one another if too much hard work :( I want honest opinions, although there is a lot at stake I also don‚Äôt wanna waste time flogging a dead horse and hurting us both in the process.Or having this constant battle over silly stuff. Is it doomed to always lack that extra oomph and I should pack it in as mates? is it the ENFP in me striving for too much? or will my natural penchant for passion destroy the relationship in the long run.

He also paid out of pocket for IV treatment that has helped me a lot. About 10k dollars. 

(Lyme disease is not covered by insurance after 4 weeks despite over 700 peer-reviewers studies it exists after 4 weeks.) 

We also have a lot in common with spiritual beliefs. 

August/September 2017
We briefly became physically involved but I‚Äôm slow so we did not have sex.  However it was really sweet and romantic and I stayed at his house a few times. He smiled a lot when he saw us in mirrors together and at one point cuddling I asked him why he was smiling so big! He responded, surprised at himself, ‚ÄúI feel content.‚Äù He normally does not smile but when he does it‚Äôs super cute. 

He also went to all my doctors appointments with me. 

He ended things in September after someone commented on our relationship and him paying for my treatment - he freaked out about being my lawyer (I understood but I also logically stood firm he did nothing wrong - we met ON a dating site so that establishes relationship prior to professional relationship). 

November 2017
We went on a trip to dr and stayed in hotel. He got a super expensive hotel. With one bed. It was late and I was tired from teaching all day and undergoing IV treatment. 
We were innocently more than friends. We also alternately bickered and cuddled the whole train back, which was weird. We have different thoughts on Pres Trump and Harvey Weinstein‚Äôs treatment of women. I didn‚Äôt want to talk about it and was a little shocked at his defending both men (‚ÄúThe women knew what they were getting into in Hollywood‚Äù type stuff to which i replied they were following their dreams to act and likely naive.) 
Would that have stopped him from liking me? Or thinking I like him??

Dec/Jan
Still emailing and texting a lot 
Spent 5 hours on the phone at the end of January 

February 
He spent whole month w aging parents 
He‚Äôs very very caring w them and their health 

Now
We email often but do not talk as much. 
My hearing is in 2 weeks. 

He has recently gotten A LOT quieter. Not conversational. Still responsive and helpful. 

I‚Äôm wondering if you think it‚Äôs possivle he still has feelings for me? 

How to go about this after the hearing? 

I‚Äôm in love with this man. 

But moreso I want to know if i should move on (and wish him well) or if he is just slow and this is murky water
This is getting painful waiting to not even know if it‚Äôs even anything on his end. He was not dating anyone when we spoke in February. He has made a few comments that sounded almost jealous bc after he ended things with me I went on a dating site briefly but did nothing with it 

He has been single for 7 years. He was once ‚Äúa dog‚Äù and hooked up with many women he says, after a breakup from a 6 year relationship. 

His spiritual beliefs are that he should not even ‚Äúspill the seed.‚Äù So he tries not to even do that. 

Please help with advice. 
I‚Äôm not so sure he‚Äôs as confident as most ‚Äúdogs‚Äù are. 
He only made a move on me after I wrote him a long email that we both move on and should be friends bc we We‚Äôre emailing and flirting all the time for like 6 months and I don‚Äôt want to be conquested as he‚Äôs made clear he has treated women in the past 
He said he did not want to conquest me, called me and asked me to see a movie he knew I‚Äôd like (fantasy lol) 

In person he‚Äôs a little awkward and tried to make moves saying goodbye like, ‚ÄúThis would be the time one party would let the other party know if they wanted to initiate contact‚Äù 

i wonder if he ended things bc he just wasn‚Äôt into me or if it was because of being my lawyer and the legality/appearance of that. 

I will edit. This is long. 

How do I get him back? To talk more? To know his thoughts or feelings? To move forward??? 

It has been nearly a year and a half since our first ‚Äúdate.‚Äù 

Thank you. 

Also, would he continue helping me even if he felt nothing? If he was with someone else? Confusing. 

He is currently helping me pay my insurance as I do not have a teaching job yet but will next September 

Thank you! 

Also, would you judge someone for health/financial problems ? As a bad person to be with even if they are trying to do better?",1520924849
ISTJ,"I'm an INTJ female who's been having a friendly relationship with an ISTJ male. The other night he was at my house, and he asked me for a favor. I, jokingly although I do have a dry sense of humor, said, ""No, I'm too tired."" He got irritable, and said, ""I've done a pretty big favor for you."" I told him I was just kidding, and he said, ""I don't joke like that. I feel like leaving."" At that point, I was embarrassed and defensive, and I told him to go. As soon as the words were out of my mouth, I regretted it. It's worth noting that he's a religious figure and shouldn't even be at my house alone. I know he stresses about that a lot, so I don't know if he was just super stressed or what, but he started yelling at me that he was done, and it took guts for him to come to my house. (He has been to my house three times. This was not the first time.) He stormed out and hasn't spoken to me since.

ISTJ,"Fellow ISTJ here, I need some help with the idea of relationships and to put it simply: I just don't know how they work. I feel like for the average person this question is a no-brainer but I was never taught how I am supposed to feel when to take things from dating to a relationship.

My question is basically how do you know when to make someone your boyfriend or girlfriend. Is it simply based on mutual interests and liking spending time with one another and that's it? Am I supposed to have the ""butterfly"" feeling in my stomach every time I see them? How am I supposed to feel? It makes me really anxious not knowing this and that anxiety has contributed to me ruining a lot of potential relationships.

As a side note, I am diagnosed with OCD, so this may be contributed to that, maybe I am just over-thinking?

ISTJ,"Hi there, ISTJs!

I posted a version of this on the ENTP sub. 

I'm going to be starting a job with a new team in my department soon, and based on our last MBTI testing at work, I believe she's an ISTJ. 

I don't know her super well, but I like her and she seems really competent. She's the one who approached me about joining her team, so that bodes well. My only worry is that, as an ENTP, a lot of our working styles and personal quirks may be very, very different - and not very complimentary. I like to brainstorm and go on tangents. I'm a big picture thinker. That doesn't mean I can't also execute on details, but it's not natural to me. ST types have a tendency to find ENTPs impractical, since we're usually more interested in possibilities than the here and now. I'm also quite gregarious and open, and she's definitely a lot more reserved. I can be argumentative and a bit nonconformist, which may be different for an SJ, but I don't know! I'm basing some of this on my ESTJ husband. 

So, I guess my question is: if you're in a leadership position, what behaviors do you love to see from your subordinates, and what do you hate? Or, if you're not in a leadership position, what behaviors annoy you from your colleagues? What would be a big no-no for you? My current boss is an ENFP so he gives me pretty free reign to take on zany ideas, push back and disagree during meetings, etc. How open to new ideas are you, ISTJs, or how best can someone present a new idea or critiques to you without rubbing you the wrong way? 

",1520013409
ISTJ,"Tl;dr: Her words as best as I could remember: ""You made me an object of obsession. You didn't even see me as a person anymore. You couldn't respect my decisions. You're on the cusp of fucking scaring me. But I'm more pissed. Stop talking to me.""

Met online, never met in real life. Same country, cities apart. General consensus from people who've heard our story is that she's most likely an immature INTP (unaware of it) and I'm toxic, clingy, and obsessive. Bottomline: we wI plead guilty to whatever fault, alright.

For a couple weeks after she said that, I was able to stay away. Three weeks ago, I sent her an email: told her if she ever wants to reconnect or need me for anything, I'd still be here for her. Promised I won't talk to her again.

But, I'm a dick. These past few days I've been messaging her on GMail's Hangouts. Apologizing over stuff I've done and telling her that I still have hope we could still restore the friendship, what we used to have, especially since summer break's nearing. Wishing her the best of luck with whatever she hopes to do and all that jazz.

Now, I'm just left wondering. Why the fuck have I not been blocked yet? Why does she still bother to read my messages? No response from her, and Hangouts doesn't have a ""seen"" feature, so IDK if she actually reads. But, when I send a message, her online status comes on, so yeah.

Shed some light? With your understanding of INTPs, what could she possibly be thinking? I mean, wouldn't you just block a guy who just wouldn't fucking stop messaging you? Yes, I'm fully aware I'm being selfish, insensitive, and a complete fucking nutjob. It's just that... *that.* Seriously, why haven't I been blocked yet?",1519996523

Sports - tried it, not for me. Video games - outgrown. Movies - don't evoke a strong emotion out of me anymore. Music - meh. Hobbies - tried everything, no luck.

Um, I had a friend. Had. Past tense. I think my problem may be related to her. Shit happened, it fell apart. Too emotionally exhausted to remember and give full details, very sorry.

I was romantically attracted to her and since she left, I've been searching for something - *anything* - that'd make me feel the same way she did. That adrenaline rush from sheer excitement when my phone pings (usually a message from her.) The contentment when talking to her. All that jazz.

I don't know what to do. I just want to feel joy again. And I'm not looking for just mindless adrenaline rush like when you ride a rollercoaster. I want to feel *joy.* I want to be happy.

1. While capable of hard-work, he barely does any. He preaches a lot about how important work is, often outright shaming people he views as ""lazy"" but he himself will spend months putting off stuff until the last minute, where he then tries to get it all done at once.




2. He's very quick to assume that he's smarter than others. Often telling people his way of doing things. He hates when other people do this to him. 




3. One of his catchphrases pretty much is; ""You'll only learn by doing"" but what he means is; ""You'll only learn by doing it the way I tell you to do it."" Which again he despises other people telling him how to do things.




4. He's got an explosive temper. I mean there's been more than one time where he's blown up, over something really, minor. He actually got into a screaming match, with a baby. So, of course, he can't stand ""people with attitude"". 




5. Interacting with him is like he views every interaction like it's some kind of win-lose contest, and he's obessed with winning. He has to get the last word, he has to be right, and when arguing he just continues to get more stubborn, and louder, and louder until it's just him screaming at the other person, just so he can ""win"".




I know these sound bad, but he does have his good traits. I wouldn't be asking if I could help him if he was just a big, meanie pants, all the time.

ISTJ,"How does one persuade ISTJs that what they were indoctrinated, conditioned, etc. to believe is false?

Example: ISTJ teachers in the US education system. Typically, they‚Äôre indoctrinated and falsely led to believe a bunch of propoganda and are basically conditioned to become drones, following orders without question, conditioned to believe what they‚Äôre told based on title, degrees, certificates, authority, etc.

In reality, the US education system is a bureaucratic indoctrination, conditioning, and propoganda machine designed to turn people into drones for the corrupt rich.

Those people base the correctness of everything on title biases, authority biases, etc.

The propoganda they‚Äôre led to believe is thus:

*Not informed on neuroplasticity*

*Believes in talents*

*Believes people aren‚Äôt credible if they don‚Äôt have a degree in the corresponding field*

*Believes degrees make people ‚Äúmore right‚Äù*

*Believes degrees and titles actually matter*

*Believes whatever the education system tells them*

*Believes people of authority should never be questioned, except politicians*

*Believes the keys to getting places in life are following orders, following the rules, and working hard rather than smartly*

*Fails to realize sources only matter for black &amp; white facts (e.g. statistics)*

*Believes the education system wants to help people*

I think you get the idea.

1. How does one persuade an ISTJ otherwise?
2. How does one persuade an ISTJ of something unusual (e.g. chakras being an attempt by ancients to explain how states of mind and the nervous system work)

ISTJ,"A bit of a foreward; I have spent the majority of my life being lazy. This might be uncommon, but there's a plethora of reasons for it. I didn't have any direction in life, was raised suboptimally and suffered from self imposed social isolation, drug addiction, and depression and anxiety since my early teenage years. Most of which I still struggle with today. Formally, I would test as an INTP/INTJ and was satisfied with that at the time. 

My life has undergone some rapid changes however. I live in a new city and have a new job in a kitchen. I actually like the job because it's very organized and every single thing is done step by step with only the faintest hint of variety (can u make my pasta with this instead of this pls?). My workplace habits is very much of what I identify most with the ISTJ type. 

I've struggled greatly with ""sorting myself out"" in the past. The amount of schedules, lists and journals I have made when feeling ""up"" only to later discard and never follow is tremendous. I have an inability to follow through. I have no formal education on paper at least, which heavily limits my career choices. That's why I have been considering sticking with this new lotchen job, it allows me to make use of some of my strengths while still being moderately enjoyable.

But back to my question, is how do I go from zero to hero? I have a huge number of things that need to get done and problems that need solving that I'm completely overwhelmed in starting and planning. It a hard to even phrase this question properly.

I'm looking for resources on how to increase conscientousness mainly. I know to accomplish anything I need a routine but it's just so damn hard to get from where I am in life now / who I Am to where and what I want to be.

I need to lose weight (I'm over 300 pounds)
I need to quit smoking (both cigarettes and weed are holding me back)
I need to improve my mental health but have no idea where to start (I hardly left my bedroom for nearly all my teenage years, socializing issues, anxiety issues and a lack of a clear identity or purpose in life or set goals)
I have a job (they keep telling me I'm an excellent trainee with potential but I feel like I should be doing more and better.... I really have no fucking idea what I would do without this job. It's be back sitting at home doing nothing buttoning and wasting my life away....)

That's not all either, but it's a good start of what a list could theoretically be. 

The big frightening realization of true isolated adulthood is starting to slap me in the face. I have bills to pay and responsibilities and I can't even take the initiative to solve my own shit. It's a problem for sure.

Would love some advice from all of you.

My friend's roommate (ISTJ Female) was engaged after 2 years, and they broke up. It was awful for her. She was, and is very conservative. She never drank or got drunk, she's never been to a bar or club. After this awful breakup, she's been wanting to go out, wanting to drink. And this isn't all the time, just when the occasion comes up, she's totally in.

Okay, so, one night we were staying in and drinking, and her and I end up making out for a while. It was great. She kind of freaked out in the morning though, and it hasn't been 100% normal since. Like she's friendly and acts normal, but I can tell she isn't 100%.

So, I'm an ENFP, I can make out with people, it's no big deal. I just enjoy the closeness/intimacy/connection. So, I didn't want to date her. I think she thinks I wanted to date her, cause she told me she wasn't interested (lol neither am I?!), and maybe still thinks I'm interested.

Just wanted to know your thoughts and how to proceed. This happened a month ago, she's my best friend's roommate, so I see her constantly. I want to give her what she wants and needs, I have no agenda or goal, just to make her life better. Let me know your thoughts, and thank you.",1516317976

ISTJ,"I've had a real tough time with online dating. I've got some questions you would hopefully be able to help me navigate.

Starting with pictures, in my mind, one is enough. You can see my face, you can see I am in good shape - that should be enough. Apparently not. I have a neutral expression, because I hate smiling artificially. I have been getting low response. I know I am not unattractive. I do not have any pictures of myself, and I find the idea of taking pictures solely for the purpose of online dating slightly sad. Okay, this is fixable once I swallow my pride.

In describing myself, should I straight out say I am an ISTJ? It seems like it puts many people off and they wrongfully assume that you are some sort of shy closet psychopath. Should I just mention positive ISTJ qualities? Should I mention I am long-term focused, or does that scare off potentially good matches who who prefer to play it by ear and see if there is 'chemistry' (oh, how I hate that word in context of dating)?

And in this environment of abundance of alternatives and constant craving for instant positive feels, how do I set the expectation about my personality so that any first date doesn't just end with 'I didn't feel there was any chemistry'? How would you approach your first date (and the build-up to it)?

How do you structure interactions past the first date so it doesn't just end up being food and drinks all the time? To me, it's completely irrelevant - we could be lying in a dumpster - I would not care, I am focused on the person. Do I keep the in-person dates light-hearted, or is this where I open up more about my personality, or do I save that for messaging app chats?

Should I completely scrap personality types, psychology etc. and just focus on shared values and interests I could potentially devote myself to in a relationship with the person I am dating?",1515443541

Specifically, I need them to act in something which pretty much rests on them (can't say that; don't want to intimidate him)... I asked and he vaguely asked if someone else could do it. I'm generally bad at asking people things considering I'm pretty blunt and unaware of emotions. 

How would you suggest trying to persuade an ISTJ to do something without putting too much pressure on them? 

  UPDATE: He said yes! For future reference I told him that we had approximately 6 months to finish filming/editing and that the script was not set in stone so he could change whatever he wasn't comfortable with (also one of his concerns was his lack of acting ability, which was not a problem). It took some time (about the whole day) but we got there, he was actually really nice about it. Thanks for your help :)

ISTJ,"Hi all!
I work in IT and my job includes hiring and training new managers, I am also heading some projects big and small.
After I became interested in MBTI and identified myself as ISTJ, I offered my colleagues to also type themselves and everyone got pretty interested, taking tests, reading descriptions and all.
What came out of it: almost all people that I hired are SJs. Moreover, almost all people working on my projects are SJs, although I did not hire them, but I tend to get involved in projects only with people I like and trust (because due to my role in company I have the right to choose my projects). ISTJs and ISFJs are prevalent. My only personal friend is ISFJ. My husband is however INFP, but this is a whole different story.
I remember reading that ISTJs subconsciously surround themselves with other SJs. What is your experience with types of people around you?

I have tried to get him to stop being friends with him, because 50% of the time we hang out with him he is drinking (about a liter of vodka), and afterwards my boyfriend would complain what a miserable time we just had. I would agree.

I was very close to getting him to stop being friends with him, but my boyfriend said if he stopped hanging out with his friend he would be sad and lonely because he does not really have any other friends he hangs out with. He does have other friends but with busy schedules they only hang out a few times a year.

Anyway, so naturally I am trying to get him to meet new people, but he has zero interest. I *have* noticed when he meets someone new he rarely talks and he appears very uncomfortable. With his friends and family he is at ease and talks regularly. What is the key to breaking him out of his shell?

ISTJ,"Fellow ISTJs, I am having a lot of trouble with my boss at my new job. He is not what I thought he'd be when I interviewed with him. He promises to deliver things and then he never delivers them and it has been a hindrance to me doing my job effectively. I worked really hard (60 hours a week, doing 3 people's jobs because we were trying to fill those roles) my first few months and have been told by multiple people that my team has done a 180 since I joined and is now known as the dream team; I improved my team's output, morale, and there is now a feeling of camaraderie that wasn't there before. I asked him if there was a possibility of a bonus because of my accomplishments, or if there isn't, I would like him to think of some form a recognition that is more than just a pat on the back. No bonus, not even a bottle of wine. Fine. He then goes on to tell me that I did a great job and he wishes one of my peers would do as much as I did. That was completely demotivating, since it came off like ""you did great, we can't reward you, and your peer isn't doing anywhere close to how well you're doing but you guys are treated equally.""

Because of his broken promises, my frustration at having to manage him so that I could do my job, and his inability to be a good manager by comparing me with my peer, I have completely written him off and now every time I have to talk to him,  I am abrasive and not a good partner. This is something that I recognize and I am trying really hard not to do, but every time he opens his mouth I just remember his failures. I've talked to him about what I expect from him, and I think he is trying to improve, but it isn't working and I don't have the patience/will to teach my boss how to do his job.

I post this here because I think many of you would harbour the same feelings that I have, and I'm hoping that some of you could give me some advice as to how I can improve the situation. I just feel very disappointed, frustrated, and unappreciated.

ISTJ,I met this senior ISTJ  a couple of years ago at a restaurant that my ISFJ friend and I would frequent.  My ISFJ friend said he would see this older man almost every time he  would eat there no matter which day of the week it happened to be.  This ISTJ captured my attention because he would always be looking at the Barron‚Äôs stock paper.  I like to think I‚Äôm an investor and sometimes I do make the right decisions but you will not see me faithfully reading stock news.  When I first approached him he was very standoffish but after a year he became more open to us and we started eating and socializing together.  He is 83 but very active with exercising and he is strict with his diet.  He and my ISFJ friend seemed to hit it off but he seemed distant with me.  I think he was wondering what my motives might be sense I‚Äôm am quite younger than bother of them.  Once he found out more about me he has now trusted me enough to offer to purchase my cell phone since I was think of purchasing a new one.   I was quick to say yes because secretly I knew he might be interested and I also know he might want my help learning to used it.  You know how you ISTJs slip behind times and technology will leave you behind times.  He told me if he bought my phone I‚Äôd have to teach him to use it.  I‚Äôm fine with it because I think it is good for him to learn.  I‚Äôm excited about it.  Before our visit was up he said that I‚Äôm too easy and the problem with me is that I think from my heart??  He bid us goodbye but didn‚Äôt mention anything more.  I‚Äôm guessing he needs to think about upgrading his cell phone plan. But why  am I too easy and so what if I think from my heart?

ISTJ,Welcome to our weekly thread! This week's question is: if you could sit down and have a chat with any celebrity (living or dead) who would it be and why?,1511725229
ISTJ,"I started working in a new company. I joined in the summer, so there was not so many coworkers around, but here he was. Always so kind and eager to help me. From the start he was asking me quesions and wanted to know more about me. We even talked on the chat sometimes during the work and he started with questions like, so you said you like nature... I kinda started falling for him and only after a month he first mentioned that he has a girlfriend. I was really surprised, since he was talking about buying an apartment and did never mention her, being on the holidays at home and never mentioned her... 

I tried stop thinking about him and things were getting better until his business trip, when we texted each other for full 6 days all the time. It was still nothing very wrong with the conversation itself but the fact that we were sending photos to each other and saying good night and good morning everyday didnt feel completely right. When he was back I promised to myself in case that he writes to me again I need to invite him for a drink and we need to have a talk. And it really happened. 

I could feel that he is not completely confortable with a drink, since he didnt know the cause of it, but he still went. We first just talked random stuff and had beers, and then I asked him what this is. He said that he was thinkin what this was as well but that he loves his GF. I said that I understand this, but I feel that we are crossing borders and that we should stop doing what we are doing. That I like him and I dont want to be hurt at the end. He said that he likes me but he agreed that this is not right, so we stopped texting. 

Next week we didnt text but instead of this we spend much more time together at work, he was around me all the time and one day he wrote to me that he is confused about his GF and how he feels. I said I cant help him with this, so he needs to figure it on his own.

We started texting again until one day when I asked him if I need to forget him. At that point I was already completely in love with him. He was saying mixed things but basically that he wants to say no, but until he is with his GF, he needs to say yes. And the he thinks he wants to stay with his GF. I said okay and asked him to please never come back to me again unless he knows he want me. Everything was very paintful for me, not only because I was in love, but also because I was feeling so guilty about his GF. 

We are doing good, not talking much at work and not texting at all. Until the other day, when we had a party and we drunk a bit too much and at one point we were hugging each other. Nothing else but it was enough for me to see that I still have feelings for him, but I honestly have no idea what is going in in his head.

Its crazy how connected I feel to him in such a short time. I believe that we have something special. I would not want him to leave his GF for me, but would like to uderstand why is he doing the things he is doing. He said that he never felt much in his live, that he is a boring person... but i dont think so.

ISTJ,"Good evening all, I am a 27 year old female ISFJ. I've been in a relationship with a male 29year old ISTJ for 6 years now, and I feel like we've become ""stuck"" in this stage. 

TL;DR at the end!

I was staying over at his house for about 4 years (because we were both studying and his parents wanted to help us) and everything was fine at the beginning, at least during the first 3-4 years. Afterwards I did start to feel as if though there was very little growth to our relationship, and little growth in him, but I just decided that it was because we were still living at his parents', and that when we moved out we would finally be able to progress. Whenever I mentioned getting a house/apartment, he would always sound excited, and hoped that we could do that quickly.

One year and a half ago, I was able to get my house, and invited him to live with me, and he said he would. I kept asking him for when he would go, and he would always just say later. As I REALLY don't like pushing people into doing stuff, I wouldn't say anything, but then 3 days later we would be passing by the store, and he would say ""oh look at that, that would look perfect in our living room, when I go live with you"" and talk excitedly about moving in. Except that it just stayed at that, and he never made a move to actually move in.

Seeing as he had mentioned it so many times, I always asked him about when he would do it, but he just said ""when I'm ready"". Eventually he did go, about 7 months ago. And he stayed there for 2 months, then came back to his parents'. When we were living together I felt as though I was his mother. The only housework he did was wash the dishes, even though we had talked about sharing responsabilites, and his excuse to not do something would always be ""I don't know how to do it"". Then when I would offer to show him he would just say ""how about later"" so he could play his video games/see youtube. Which is fine, again I do NOT like forcing people to do what I want them to do, and it's hard for me to ask for help anyway, so I just took the work load and did the rest... but then he would feel bad. He would say ""oh, I never do anything around here, I don't know how to do anything"". Which was true, but he never actually took any action to fix that. 

He came back to his parents' house to ""learn how to do things"" and surprise, he has done nothing to learn things. I have talked about this issue with him before, and it always ends with ""I will get better, I will learn how to do things and go back to live with you"". Well 7 months later and he has done nothing to fix this. I have been trying to cope with this by lowering my expectations of him time and time again, but at this point I feel that I just cannot expect anything at all from him but basic respect, but I feel no more excitment at seeing him, and I feel as if he was just those summer boyfriends you get for a little while. I have also spoken to him about this, and he has said ""I'll work harder so you don't feel that way"". Yeah, nothing so far, but he seems happy enoough in our relationship.

Is it me? Am I still expecting too much? I'm aware that emotionally distancing myself from him isn't the best answer, but I just don't wanna be nagging him constantly, but at the same time I feel almost as if though I have already lost him, but his family and his friends are deeply important to me and I don't wanna lose them.

TL;DR: I feel emotionally distanced from my partner and have spoken to him about it several times. He has said he'll do better and hasn't actually done anything.

ISTJ,"Hello, I will be posting this to both this sub as well as the INFJ sub, as I have previously (up until this week) considered myself one. 

I've come to believe that, while MBTI can act as a quide regarding people's tendencies, we are far too complex and malleable to be confined to one ""type."" Using one's results to improve and become more self aware is ideal, but even this is difficult to achieve since the result's accuracy is dependent on the subject, and their answers can be askew due to the barnum effect and self-serving bias. In addition, it's easy for a type to look at their weaknesses and see the justification in them based on their type and motivations, then reason why they need not change at all. This can be suffocating to personal growth. 

I wanted to test the magnitude of my own self-serving bias, and so retook the test (I took the ""16 Personalities"" version) and was as hard on myself in my answers as I could be. I thought of real life examples and asked myself what other people would think my answer should be (In particular, I thought of my mom and boyfriend, both people whom I consider to be critical yet accurate).

My result, as you might have guessed, was ISTJ. I based my answers on my flaws, not my strengths. Yet upon reading more about the ISTJ, I was able to relate and even liked the qualities of you guys.

I don't feel that I could easily identify with just any type. However, perhaps the context under which one considers themselves and the examples they apply to the questions primes them to look at themselves in a certain perspective. This is why one can so easily relate to their results. If I thought of every example where I behaved in an authoritative, logical manner (I am sure that even submissive, overly emotional people could recall a situation in where they perceived this as their behavior), I could just as easily identify with an ENTJ. 

I apologize in advance for these loose examples. I want to know what the rest of you think. Which facts give you belief in this crude classification system? Thanks. ",1510331569

ISTJ,"1. He internally strives towards stability, a world that does not change, relationships that do not change - logically beautiful and coherent, calculated, and well reasoned through. 

2. His logical program is meant to be an alternative to any sort of destabilization of his environment and surrounding structures: social, political, physical, biological, and so on. For this very reason, his understanding of consistency, reasonableness, rationality is linked, first of all, to the organization of structural order (the ""order of things"") within the framework of some real, concretely existing system. Outside of the system the he never examines anything. Any phenomenon is viewed by him as part of certain existing system, that is regulated by certain patters and laws and a certain logical order. Perceiving his surrounding reality from the point of view of its systematization, logical design, and coherence, he is constantly analyzing the systems existing around himself . Asks himself the question: is this an isolated occurrence, or it is attributable to some system? Is this an isolated act, or is this a model of behavior? Is this an accidental actions or motion, or is there some system of views and values behind it? To understand the inner essence of phenomena, to figure out the cause-effect connections between phenomena of the most varied sort, to analyze the observed phenomena, to systematize the conclusions, to derive some more generalized definition and introduce it into an already existing system of views, to chose from all existing systems the one most suitable for achievement of specific goals and to improve it, to adapt this system to the specific social conditions, thinking it over and working through the smallest details - all of this is the sphere of on-going intellectual activity of any of the representatives of this type.

Under no circumstances can he be ""by himself"", ""thinking only for himself"", ""himself only for himself"" - this contradicts the program of his intellect too much, not independent; ""One for all, all for one"" . For this reason he holds conformism and loyalty with respect to the existing regime, since he often attempts to find an application for himself within an existing ruling social system. Even if a representative of this type exists as some ""antisocial"" element, nevertheless he cannot be ""by himself"". For him it is difficult to be a ""lone wolf""; therefore, he will for certain be organized within the framework some or another social structure, where he will fulfill all entrusted to him duties and hold the responsibility for his actions - another form of behavior for him simply does not exist.

4. In his opinion, the behavior of a person needs to correspond to his position, otherwise public consciousness will be disoriented by models of the ""unbecoming"" behavior, which will lead to the destabilization of the social system. Respect for the authority - is one of the most important values of his intellectual structure. Orientation at authority - is an important motivation for many of his actions, that in many respects determine the nature of his relationships and behavior. He is always ready to directly counter and fight any manifestations of disorder, incompetence, and irresponsibility in society. He can settle comfortably into any level of the social hierarchy. For him the main thing is to occupy a place in this system. He or she can carry out any official work, and conduct his business relations in accordance to the occupied position: make demands of subordinates and try not to argue with his higher-ups. ""The management knows better"" - is an LSI phrase, and the argument: ""I was only carrying out orders"" - is the most convincing one. And it is incomprehensible to the ISTj how it's possible to dispute this. According to LSI's hierarchical logic, within his system the subordinates must obey those standing above them, and the young must obey the elders.

5.  He loves to use verified tried-and-tested methods, especially if they agree with his own point of view and are known by him to bring positive results.

6. He doesn‚Äôt agree with the assertion that ""any pleasure in this life comes at a price"";. In his understanding, the ability to tune and adjust one's experiences with the orientation towards harmony and pleasure - is his own individual capability, his own merit. Therefore, why does he has to pay for it? Under no circumstances does he place his personal prosperity, well-being, and convenience under a destructive blow. Moreover, he tries not to create any precedents for this. If the current circumstances have already folded in an unfavorable to him manner, he will try to come out of this situation with minimal losses for himself. As a result of such attitude and values, he can make an impression of an egoistical, self-loving, insensitive person. Such opinions, that do arise in people around him, indeed substantially complicate his life. However, he will obstinately and stubbornly defend his right to live as he wishes, supporting and motivating it by the fact that he doesn't really want to cause suffering or problems to anyone else, and sincerely feels upset if his lifestyle causes suffering and inconvenience to anyone.

7. His focus on the goal in the development of new procedures and new technologies. They are interested in any scientific discovery from the point of view of its practical application. He chooses a rational approach for any type of work. While at this, his rationalism sets a goal of increasing the effectiveness of labor and alleviating the work conditions to make them less burdensome. He can take on any assignment or task with enthusiasm, if only it would bring some real, concrete, perceptible benefit. 

8.  He is able to put strong pressure on other people, while never using a commanding tone. In situations when it is necessary for him to subordinate others to his will, he does this by taking action on his sensations ‚Äì he begins to express whole ""range"" of unpleasant sensations: impatience, agonizing desire, irritation, suffering, offence, hostility. As a result of such displays, much sensory discomfort is created, which painfully acts on others. Applying this method, he achieves fulfillment of many of his desires and requirements with relative ease. As a rule, they don't know about the force of their volitional effect. They do not recognize or realize it. Frequently they tend to view themselves as a kind of soft, amiable, and reasonable people. They do not always understand why other people so quickly yield to their wishes.

ISTJ,"I'm the NT; he's the SJ. Both 'T' types. He's...perfect. Exactly what I wanted in a baffling and alarming way. I'm hoping someone can help decode his behavior, explain whether I still have a shot, and advise how best to proceed assuming I haven't wrecked everything. 

We exchanged several emails prior to meeting in person. Immediate and visceral chemistry upon meeting, though he kept it chill in SJ fashion. 

""Wow, __...you're incredibly handsome!"" //visible shock 

""You, too. :)""

He invited me over, offered the shower (I'd worked a double that day) put on a movie, made drinks, and mine was a bit too strong. That's not why we had sex, but maybe why I was more of the aggressor (initially; he quickly took over *swoon*).

By then it was around 6am. I don't sleep well in strange beds, so the sex only put me under a few hours. Then I was awake and chatty/""OhShit;SJsarecrazyresponsible.Whatifhewon'tlikemeanymorebecauseIfuckedhimonthefirstdate?""

Fifteen minutes into that:

""__, I think you'd better head on out.""

The SJ has decided it's time for me to leave‚Äîhe needs his sleep‚Äîand is kindly efficient about making that happen. Of course, I comply, explaining about and apologizing for my insomnia, etc. Some more light conversation in which I attempt to intuit what's actually happening (sleep, of course‚Äîbut does he want to see me again?) , this last thing where I look up at him and he shutters his eyes. There's pain, and I can't figure out whether it's pity or regret or what's going on. So I leave. 

This was Friday night/Saturday morning. Last night, I still hadn't heard from him and decided to text my number (only iMessages up to that point). I realize it was a mistake to text and that I should have waited. Then I went one better and told him I liked him, wasn't good at games, needed to plan my weekend and hoped I'd hear from him.

I think I messed up on multiple levels, and I'm not sure the situation can be salvaged. This is pretty embarrassing, so I'd appreciate if people would refrain from being cruel. Give it to me straight, but don't be an ass about it. 


TL/DR: I'm afraid I've run off an ISTJ by being too intense. What can I expect/what do I do? How can I tell courtesy from actual interest? He sent me home with clean clothes; will he want them back?


UPDATE: He ""doesn't think we're a match, sorry, but best of luck to me."" I  thanked him for letting me know, said I'm sorry too, and I guess that's the end of that. :-(

UPDATE #2: (Scrapped). Gotta let it go. Will let it go. I'm a good person right now. I'm worthy.

UPDATE #3: And yet... :-/

ISTJ,"So I‚Äôm looking into a career change - big time. I‚Äôm currently a claims adjuster for workers comp claims, and have been for the past 3 years. I‚Äôve also been miserable for the past 3 years! I mostly hate it because of the people who abuse the system, the volume of work that needs to be done, and the fact that I feel that I can‚Äôt even control *any* of it. I also hate that I‚Äôm sitting at a desk all day every day, at the same time every day. 

Real estate interests me because you‚Äôre able to talk to people and help them get through with what they need. That‚Äôs one part I actually like about my current job - but again, you just can‚Äôt control what a claimant is going to do, plus as an adjuster, your customer is really the employer, so as you can imagine, it‚Äôs very hard to keep all people happy, when they are against each other from the beginning.

But back to real estate - I also like the idea that I have freedom in work schedule, and freedom that I can be out and about, and not ALWAYS chained to a desk. I don‚Äôt mind having my own desk, I just hate that I literally cannot do any work unless I‚Äôm at it. I want to see the people that I‚Äôm helping and guide them through it. My girlfriend (whom I live with) is a restaurant manager that can work 50-55 hours a week, a lot of those hours being nights and weekends - so naturally having a ‚Äú9-5‚Äù as I currently do, is a huge problem in our relationship. 

Maybe this is weird - I mean, as an ISTJ, you‚Äôre naturally introverted, and probably don‚Äôt like social interaction much. But I love that I could control a situation in where I am actually helping someone, and the person actually wants the help!

ISTJ,"I'm am engineer who changed jobs 6 months ago from private to public sector. I mainly changed because of the pension (earlier retirement), job security, and the ever elusive 40 hour work week.

One of the things I did not anticipate was going from working for one manager on large projects to three or more managers all with their own small projects/tasks. The last 3 years I was always working on one, maybe two, design projects at a time for weeks on end, but now in my current role I'm juggling 8-12 different project tasks at a time. Some I'm supposed to take on as designer. Some I'm supposed to manage younger engineers/interns on. Multiple times a week I have to cover for inspectors or complete reviews for them.

On top of this my reporting manager is constantly changing what task is my priority. Oftentimes daily. I know a lot of my stress simply comes from having to jump from project to project and never really get into them.

My question that I'm having trouble answering is that even if my boss didn't keep changing direction all the time, as an ISTJ am I still going to go crazy trying to juggle a position where I'm expected to wear the hats of designer, manager, and even inspector all at once? 

Ive brought up to my manager once before that the constant change of priorities is keeping me from getting anything done. His reply was that I'll get used to it.

He recently lost his grandfather whom he was very close to. He is very introverted (~87%) and isn't one to show any negative emotions. When we were alone, I sat down with him and recommended that he at least vent to someone he trusted--that if he bottled it up, the pressure could eventually break him. I told him he could come to me if he felt comfortable doing so as I pass no judgement. He seemed thankful and did vent some, but now seems to be just going through the motions and ""burying it"" while he keeps himself busy. This is probably his own way of coping, but I want to make sure I'm doing all I can.

ISTJ,"I have an ISTJ friend who displays the following behavior.

&gt;When Fi takes too strong a role in cognition and overtakes Te, forming an ""SiFi loop"", the ISTJ may completely and totally withdraw from virtually all surroundings and circumstances which are not immediately familiar and comforting to his sense of stable interpretive meaning. All forms of external interaction seems to involve uncertainty, which makes them inherently unsafe--avoidant behavior becomes the norm, as the ISTJ with poor Te finds himself both unable to confidently take command of any situation or assert his organizational abilities toward any productive end, and irrationally sensitive to any form of experiential input which does not align with the sense of dependable routine which defines the boundaries of his comfort zone. The SiFi loop ISTJ will continue to narrow his perceptual intake further and further, convinced that anything he doesn't already know completely will only attack and further corrupt or damage his easily impressionable sense of personal ethics and ideals. Inferior Ne--as we will see in the next section--leads to a flood of dangerous and threatening external possibilities which must be contained and avoided at all costs.

He's still using Windows 7 and I offered to buy him Windows 10 but he refused, saying he likes it the old way. He is severely depressed and I want to help him.

He is my first boyfriend, while for him im his sixth, we have an age difference of 8 years and have different nationalities. Not that it was a problem for us ... 
We started to meet once a month and I even started staying at his place at some weekends but ive notice an 180¬∞ change in his behaviour towards me ... he doesnt almost text me or even have long conversations anymore with me and the few and little time we are together he doesnt seem very intimate towards me... almost no talking, kissing or even hold hands or cuddling ... i know we have very different ways of seeing things and different necessities as its normal according to our personalities... ive tried to approach him about that but he insists he is the same and if he is its probably because he is been tired with work ... but it already passed some months and he is still the same ... i think we are really different but if he loves me back as i do then there's no problem, but i really cant tell and it feels like im doing almost all the effort ... he is very supportive but i don't want to annoy him also with all my problems ... we even got into fights because of that and even almost broke up ...

ISTJ,"I think how I feel rn would be more relatable to you guys so posting here :)

More in depth story that you can just ignore and answer the main question: 

I am extremely used to focusing on one specific thing and putting my heart into it, whilst ignoring everything else, be it health or other tasks I should be doing.

But my problem is that I do not have enough time to do a Certain Thing(it is a bunch of exams basically), so either I separate my work into chunks and do a bit of each chunk everyday over an extended period of time OR I take on the entire HUGE workload in one go over a tiny period of time and try my best to finish and hope for the best (which every single person I have spoken to about this, including professionals and teachers, has said is a horrible idea because it is 99.9% impossible to finish because the syllabus is enormous).

I'm so used to focusing on specific long term goals though, I feel like if I try doing multiple things at once I'll just fuck it up somehow (I have tried and fucked up before). My heart, my gut, they both want me to just take this whole thing on and do my best, screw what everyone says! I am clinging to that 0.01% chance I have at this to do well.

But, logically, this is a pretty terrible idea and even if I'm uncomfortable with it I should learn to focus on multiple goals at once, it is a life skill that I should have regardless. I'm currently 16, and I'm sure it will help me a lot to get through work life and university.

So yeah. I cannot express to you how much I would rather just take on the massive workload instead of push it off for a while and do a little bit of it at a time, I want to get this done and move onnn... I mean, I could just suck it up and get to it since I know what the rationally best option is but, since I have a choice... why not do what my heart wants? :( even if it's a really really shitty idea...

Like, that feeling where you just really want to do something but everything, adults, logic, reality, even yourself, is against you? UGH. Thanks in advance.

- She has a good memory and reminds about everything in vivid detail. Like very, very vivid detail. I'm INFJ and I basically only talk about my opinions and events from a generalized perspective, and I try to externalize the ""essence"" of things... I am terrible at dealing with detail. 

- Practical, doesn't seem to explore too much abstract subjects. Focused on ""duty"" and work.

- Complains about a lot of stuff. I mean, a lot. Things she sees as stupid and nonsensical in general. 

- Says she doesn't have friends/is bad at making friends. This is probably more related to her being Aspergers.

- Has a super hardass vibe. And I'm not saying this as an offense. It is more like a ""definite"" vibe, ""I-know-what-I-am-talking-about"" vibe. She seems quiet and calm for the most part, but hardass at the same time. 

Here is the thing, I'm starting to wonder if ISTJ is actually my ""opposite"" type. Cause where I'm Ni, ISTJ is Si. Where I'm Fe, ISTJ is Te. Where I'm Ti, ISTJ is Fi. Where I'm Se, ISTJ is Ne.

Hearing that really came out of left field given how hard I felt I was trying to act more upbeat than I normally would. A lot of it probably has to do with my demeanor; I definitely have a strong case of RBF going, which doesn't help.

Have any of you other ISTJs had similar experiences or comments made about you? Do you have any advice about how to... well... not be so ""intimidating?""

I learned that I have istj personality and the outline is pretty cleared that I have these traits.

So I always think that I would be a great fit, if I was a gear in a massive working system. You can call it ""bureaucrats"" with tons of paperwork and keeping the order of the society behind the closed doors. its like knowing your borders and getting the best benefits from that. For example, if you are new to system and you want to learn how it is working and get the upper hand by researching its behaviours and all that. In dnd traits (chaotic evil, lawfully good etc), I feel lawful evil/neutral is the most suitable one. That's because, you might want to rise to top, but everything should be performed according to law and order. Moreover, I feel like everything has some hierarcy and responsibilities to fulfill and I am the cpu unit that do the computing and maintaining the order.

ISTJ,"Thoughts about Si, Se, Ni and Ne, context, cross-context, worldview, and possibilities

* Si and Se deal with real experiences directly.
* Ni and Ne deal with patterns and connections.
* Si and Ni are concerned with worldview.
* Se and Ne are concerned with possibilities.

Ni/Se and Si/Ne work together as pairs:

* Ni/Se operate within one context at a time. Se usually focuses on the present context, but Ni can mentally shift the context in space/time so Se can have a look at it.
* Si/Ne are cross-contextual. So Si builds up insights over time, and Ne uses it as a springboard to find parallels between situations, objects, ideas, anything.

Therefore:

* Ni builds its worldview by looking at patterns and connections within a single context at a time.
* Si builds its worldview by looking at real experiences across contexts.
* Se finds possibilities by looking at real experiences in the current context.
* Ne finds possibilities by looking at patterns and connections across contexts.

Any comments, corrections, elaboration, or relevant anecdotes welcome.

ISTJ,"I'm so tired of people reading some half assed ISTJ description on the internet and then assume that we are mindless people who follow ""traditions"" for traditions' sake. 

Personally, I find the word 'traditional' to be a low key insult when used to describe me. 'Tradition' implies that I do something *just for the sake of it.* It insinuates that I have applied no critical thought or analysis or personal values to the things that I do.

ISTJs don't do 'tradition'. We do *efficiency and reliability* and, with developed Fi, *things that we highly value as proper/right*. 

If I happen to order a particular food every time I visit a particular restaurant, it's because this particular food has *proven* to be tasty or beneficial in some healthy way. I'll most likely order it not because tradition dictates, but because I'm *guaranteed* to enjoy it. It's cataloged in my brain as a reliable source of gastro satisfaction in this particular restaurant. And if I happen to grow tired of this particular food, shock twist, I won't order it anymore. 

In a thread somewhere in this sub, the OP actually thinks that an ISTJ would avoid dating a person of another race because this ISTJ's family ""traditionally"" doesn't allow dating outside of their race. Basically, OP thinks that this ISTJ would choose to be a racist simply because tradition dictates. 

*colossal eyeroll*

If an ISTJ is an asshole, it is definitely *not* because it has been ""family tradition"" to be an asshole...

If an ISTJ is an asshole, it's because they're an asshole. That, or their Fi isn't strong enough for them to resist family/peer pressure and stand by their decent personal values.

ISTJ,"Hi. i'm (M, 21) ENTP and my girlfriend is (F, 19) ISTJ and we are dating for more or less 1,5 years. We both were always worried to tell our parents about the relationship because she is Japanese and i'm korean (howeaver we live and we were born in Brazil). When i told my father about her he started saying silly (and not friendly) things about japanese people so i waited for a year to tell my mom. After that they met each other and the first impression was good the only problem about her ,they say, Is that she is Japanese.
In her side, her mom don't like me, she her that she once loved an non-japanese guy and after a while she broke up with the guy because of the non-japanese thing, so her mom is expecting (but not actively telling) her to break with me because i'm korean. My girlfriend tells me that she says bad things about the korean people, just like my father did.
I think she likes me, we always have a great time when we are together, but she lacks a bit of ""romance or something like that"" when we are far apart for sometime chatting, and we ""fight"" but not ""fight"" (it's basically me trying to get her attention). I'm curently in another country, and we will not see each other for 4 months.
When we started dating i made her to do the personality profile test, and she said she was an ISTJ, you as an ISTJ, what would you do in her position? Would you choose the tradition over your boyfriend? (I had and still have to answer the same question, but i have chosen her instead of the tradition because i think she is worth the price) 
From what i think, she has to have a position about our relationship which she is hiding from me. 
I don't want to break with her neither being in the dark waiting for her answer to that (if she is breaking up with me i wish she did faster).

ISTJ,"I have an ISTJ friend that I mostly enjoy being around, but he has these traits that at times drives me insane, and I get this borderline feeling of both laughing and crying.

Note: Every quote I bring up here is my best translation from swedish into english, so if some of them might not make total sense that might be the reason why.

So, first things first. I strongly believe that he's got a slight touch of aspergers, judging from the the usual indications such as having trouble to understand when he's hurt people. He can say the most awful things to pretty much anyone if he's in the mood. 
I've on numerous occasions done the same thing to him that he recently did to me or to somebody else (in an educative purpose). But he's seemingly clueless why somebody would hurt him in such a way. 

His self insight is also piss poor, he routinely calls people out and mocks them for things that can be applied even more to himself. Sometimes he even praises himself for something he just criticized another person for.  

If somebody has a hypothesis about someone or something, and even makes it clear that they're not totaly sure about it, he still almost always takes it as gospel.

A recent example of his poor self insight and totaly devoid empathy is when I, him and his collegaue were on vacation, and he would routinely say things such as ""You're such a beta male"" or ""If you're so intelligent, why won't you apply that into having game and getting laid every other night?"". Probably relevant to add that I'm 99% sure he's a virgin.

So one night his colleague tries to delve a little bit deeper into his mind brings up that being a virgin is nothing to be ashamed of (He has never admitted he's a virgin). He just sits completely still and gives him the silent treatment. His eyes starts watering and he's close to crying. When his colleague realizes that he apologizes and quits the subject.
I and his colleague later goes out to drink, but ISTJ stays home because he thought his colleague ruined the night for him. Later that night I and his colleague meet 2 girls which we decide to meet again the next night.

The next day I decide I won't say a single thing back to him when he says things like I've mentioned earlier in hope of him getting tired of it. The only thing it results in is him taking it to a whole new level, seemingly thinking he's stronger and superior as I won't ""bite back"". Routinely commenting that I will fuck up with the girls we'll meet later.

Later that night he says something like ""Oh, you're such a beta male"",  as I'm starting to get rather tipsy I for the first time that day bite back with ""How fucking alpha are you yourself?"", he seems to be taken totally off guard that I actually replied to him. After a few seconds of confusion he replies with ""Atleast I'm further up the hierarchy than you"". I reply with ""We shall not go where we went yesterday(when his colleague talked about virginity)"". He just heads straight home without even saying goodbye.

So how do I handle a person like this? I still want him as my friend, but it's becoming extremely taxing to be around him when he acts like he does.",1504988959

While he assured me that he loved me very much and that there was no one else in the picture (we both agreed to 100% honesty), he just didn't want us to be distracted from our careers. We split amicably, and heartbroken. Fast forward three weeks, I'm in a new town and decide to call him about it. I realized that he had barely been messaging me, despite promising to not cut each other out of our lives (as he deemed it too cruel). I was dumb, and asked if he still loved me. And he told me that he didn't know because he doesn't think about love and stuff like that as he's too focused on his training and working out. And that he's not even thinking about relationships at all. It hurt, of course.

I know that ENFP and ISTJ relationships are difficult to work out, but I can't help but feel so incredibly attracted to him, I'm not too sure why either. This is the first time I'm crushing so hard on an ISTJ - the fact that I actually confessed, albeit not taken seriously by him.
Sometimes when I'm too tired from a long day and we travel back home together and I don't speak, after a few minutes of silence he would initiate a conversation and that gets me talking again.

First, I'm INFJ. I happen to like one of you almost from the beginning since I moved in to a new house. At the beginning, it seemed that he liked me, he was more open, would ask me about my day, my plans for the weekend, do small things for me or offering me some stuff. We even hung out with some of his friends a couple of times.

There were some issues with his health, and maybe some times I was too shy and confused because a kind of crush on him. 
There's this episode which I think I may have spoiled things. One night we were talking (far from each other in the living room) and suddenly he smiled to me in a way that know I recognise as flirting, but at that time the only thing I could do was looking at him tenderly, kind of smirked but then looked other way and started doing something else because I was just blocked. I know I can be this messy with my emotions.

The thing is, recently, he's more withdrawn than ever. It's me who starts the conversations (short) all the time, but he seems uninterested and answers briefly. He is sarcastic sometimes, not friendly to me anymore, he doesn't try to initiate any interaction unless it's for practical matters and that's a minimum.

I take it as he lost all the interest and doesn't care about me anymore. Do you have any tips for me to improve our housemate relation? Once you close up, do you closeup forever, is this the behavior  I should expect for future?

Is there anything I could do, or just give up?

I've been working as a freelancer in TV in NYC for the last 10 years, working my way up from a lowly Production Assistant and more recently became a Producer. The problem is, working in this business has brought me so much stress and anxiety and what I crave is consistency. By the time I mostly learn the job and whats expected of me, I'm out of a job and looking for another one. Finding the next job and continuing the cycle for the past 10 years has definitely taken its toll on me and I know there must be a better fit for me.

I took the time to read a few career change books and what I learned about myself is that I'm an ISTJ. I've been successful in TV using my ISTJ skills to get the job done perfectly (in my eyes), sacrificing my time and energy on each one figuring out the unknown and working twice as hard to find what the standard is - emulating what others have done or do to find a pattern or set of ""rules"" to follow. Making the ""right"" decision has always been a challenge. By all accounts, I'm regarded as successful and I make good money doing what I do but it doesn't fulfill me and I want stability and order to my career. Looking for the 9-5 where I know whats expected of me and I'm working full time.

* Enabling, assisting other people to locate information
* Assisting, serving, helping
* Diagnosing by seeing the relationship between clues
* Analyzing by perceiving patterns in data, events, or processes, or accurately evaluating information
* Systematizing, prioritizing, categorizing, or organizing information
* Researching by gathering or compiling information
* Making decisions based on the meaning of data or information
* Organizing information, projects, or events
* Retrieving or finding information, researching, compiling information

My analysis paralysis has had me looking into a variety of career options but none have felt right. I want this decision to come from within to see a logical or correct choice. 

Has anyone been stuck like this and figured out a way forward? Thank you!",1503600293

ISTJ,"Hello, noticed from personal experience my friends and exes who were ISTJ, rarely were ever upfront romantically. They would tell you a portion of the truth hoping you'd understand the rest and often are inconsistant, especially with disinterest.

I'm an INTJ, so I guess that makes me more blunt or straightforward and I see it as a sign of respect. Examples of things ISTJs will do is ignoring messages and instead of saying, ""I don't have feelings... I don't think we will ever work out... x and y..."" they make excuses. They seem to avoid confrontation (romantically again, not in a business atmosphere) and even if the other person is suffering, they will be oblivious or just let it continue instead of honesty. At first I thought my ex was honest when he said he was busy but I'm becoming confident in this observation. Withdrawal, short responses and rudeness are common as well.

ISTJ,"Background: Female 24 INFP here pretty crazy in love with a male 21 ISTJ. We've been training the same sport at the same gym, and since I've been single for the last year and a half he's the only guy I've been interested in. I haven't done anything about it because I'm nervous about how it would affect the dynamic of our team, and he's someone I value very highly as a person to train closely with because he is so knowledgeable. I also want to see him make his dreams come true and I don't want to ""get in the way"" so I do everything I possibly can to help and support him. I've never given him any direct verbal indication that I have strong feelings for him, or sadly, even that I support him and believe in him. I've never, ever been this shy about these things with a guy before. 

He treats me differently than any other girl I've seen him interact with, but I'm not sure if that's a good thing. We mutually tend to ignore each other in class (I prefer not to learn new moves with him because I get self conscious even though I know he'll be very supportive if I'm not doing the move correctly). I am the one girl he can't have a casual conversation with and he is the one boy I can't have a casual conversation with. This isn't to say we don't interact. When we do, it's usually a very playful argument. 

Outside of class when we train extra hours together alone we're both more comfortable, and will be either strictly business and dedicated to training or sometimes he'll do goofy things like invent moves. One time he grabbed my nose and when I got after him about it he said he was ""training"" and that I need to let him do the move, he was joking of course. Sometimes he surprises me with extra things to train and will set up something to help me work on things he thinks I need help with and will give very helpful advice. 

We have a hard time talking one on one, we don't look at each other more than a few split seconds and mutually prefer to communicate with one another through a third person. I get very bashful and know I blush, and I think sometimes he does too. But when we're traveling or training alone together, the silence can be very comfortable and welcome, especially before a competition. He's one of the few people I can share silence with comfortably. 

When there's another person with us, we can talk and argue about whatever to our heart's content. We still don't generally direct the conversation at each other, but we're indirectly communicating. In a text group chat or in real life we mutually pick on the most active other person. Sometimes he succeeds in making me really jealous... haha. 

He likes teaching and quizzing me on things like statistics and rules, and then likes to show off what he teaches me about (like football) to the head instructor, with whom he's very close. 

We talk about each other a lot. I'll say something off handedly to him and it'll make its way back to me through another team mate. People also comment on how our relationship seems tense, which always catches me off guard. 

He remembers almost everything I say. 

At different times he's very vehemently stated that I'm a hardworking and nice person. The only direct compliments I remember him giving me. 

He likes to coach and encourage me. In fact he was the first person to tell me not to give up [our sport]. Sometimes outside of class if we're playing a game or different sport and I'm struggling with a concept he'll coach me and encourage me even if he's on the opposite team. 

Last summer a team mate who knew and kept my secret about me liking Mr ISTJ teased us about being lovebirds. He would always excitedly respond that he would never date me, but I'm not sure if that is really true or not. (This team mate has kept the secret to date but we're no longer close friends.)

If he tries to make a dirty joke or tease me for liking something about himself, eg I jokingly patronize him for being too aggressive and he responds by telling me that I like it, he always always embarrasses himself. It's adorable. 

Anyway, based on that I'm not sure if he has interest or no interest. Sometimes I think he's trying to distance me because he's not interested, and sometimes I think he's trying to distance me because he *IS* interested. As previously stated I'm not sure if it's wise to tell him how I feel. We will be traveling frequently together either just us or with 1-2 other mates in the near future. It's been a decent time that we've known each other and he hasn't seemed to have pursued me, so I wonder if I should just move on and focus on our relationship strictly as team mates. I wonder if I'm confusing him, too, and would like to put an end to that. What's your take? How should I move forward? 

I know these relationship questions get old but I appreciate any input as it would put my mind at ease.

ISTJ,"Hi! Without giving out too many details, I met a single ISTJ (100% certain he is one) in the workplace. Because of how our teams work, I don't see him too often, but I have developed a pretty big crush on him, and we got coffee recently since he offered to give me career advice. I was silly and didn't realize that would have been a good time to give him my number to gauge interest, but ah well.

He said if I try to return (am an intern and will be looking for full-time next year) he would love for me to come back and work on his team---we haven't really had a chance to work together on things/he hasn't seen my working capabilities at all. I can't tell whether he likes me in an impersonal or personal manner---he's initiated the chance to get coffee but besides basic questions didn't really go in depth on asking more personal questions about me which I believe an ISTJ would do if they were romantically interested. It's probably just him being friendly and helpful (since you guys really are that!), but I can see him being hesitant to pursue anything (I'm an intern---age difference of 7 years, not sure if I will be in his city next year).

Anyways, I digress. How can I tell whether one of you guys is interested in a girl romantically vs. just trying to be a helpful person? What does my situation sound like to you all?

ISTJ,"Just a random curiosity that popped into my head while chatting with another friendo. 

I worked with an ISTJ who was a few decades older than me (I'm 22) and although I think I annoying her at first, she seemed to grow rather fond of me after I came to her for help for a few times (although I'm sure it's not the only reason, she deals with people who take her for granted/act better a lot. ppsh, always be polite to people, especially your head admins)

Having to show someone again and again is irritating, but there are some super obvious things I never learned how to do, being the Damn Millenial that I am. Postage, fax machines, etc. are all super confusing to me so I always went to her for help LOL. 

She would always shake her head and sigh but she always slipped me random cute office goodies and even booked me an extra night free in Vegas for a trip and said ""Technically, the convention STARTS that day"" hehe. She ended up telling me that she thinks it's amusing and kind of fun to help someone learn something new and kind of be the resident expert, and she doesn't get to do that a lot.

I know there's also a sort of phenomenon I read about where people actually like you more if they do you favors, and not the other way round. 

Do you guys enjoy teaching or helping others, in general? Could that be more of a generational thing? I'm an ENTP but very rarely do I enjoy training or teaching, unless that's my literal job. p: What sort of behaviors or qualities do you like in others?

ISTJ,"Hey everyone,
I work register/gift wrapper at a store for the summer (ending at the end of August), just recently when we've been closing our charge totals from the machine haven't been matching up to our charge totals to the register, nothing ever considerably big, but a difference nonetheless. These things happen, my co-workers and I understand, but recently I've been getting accused by my one coworker of being the one to mess up the register thus creating the discrepancy. 

All my other coworkers have been working there a long time and this is my first summer on the register, so, I'll admit, sometimes when things get busy I'll mess something up or press the wrong button or whatever. But 100% if I know I messed up or think I messed up, I'll tell my coworker and they'll see what happened. 

The other night I had no problem when my coworker closed, but the night before and this night, they didn't match up. Two nights ago we had some issues with people using Visa Gift Cards and we knew that it was going to be an issue later. Tonight, we compared totals an hour before close and they matched up. I only used the register once in that last hour and was 1000% sure that the one sale I did, I didn't have any problems. But my coworker is seemingly blaming it on me (he's very nice so he's not actually telling me I did anything wrong, but he keeps saying he didn't do anything wrong)

So. That kind of pisses me off, but I get it because they've been there for MUCH longer than I have. But the thing that gets me is that they always have their Bluetooth piece in and are on the phone for usually like 40% of their shift which can be very distracting, especially when you're ringing up prices and trying to talk to two or three people at once. I'm not totally blaming them but I'm just saying it could've been either of us. Then my coworker said that our boss might just have to put me on wrapping only duty which, to be honest, I'd be bored as fuck and not a helpful employee and would probably just offer to quit because I'd be wasting everyone's time. 

No one else has previously mentioned me being shit at the register job until tonight, because, once again, it happens occasionally through everyone's faults here and there, so I think that's why I'm really salty and needed to rant. I have tomorrow off so we'll see what happens when I get back on Thursday. 

TL;DR - Getting accused by a coworker for messing up the register even though I'm sure I didn't do anything wrong. 

Anyone have any tips/similar stories or honestly any input on this situation? I could really use some feedback. 

Thanks. ",1501641204
ISTJ,"Hey guys, I got a couple questions for you/people who know ISTJ's well.

I have this manager at work that always seemed into me, but very timid and nervous. I found out he was an ISTJ pretty early on. We've worked together for quite some time and only recently became very good friends. I broke up with my boyfriend of two years a couple weeks ago, and this ISTJ has been a remarkable support system and friend. When he found out we broke up, he jumped at the opportunity to invite me over. We watched movies, had a few drinks and talked until 5am despite the fact that he worked the next morning. We did this again a couple nights in a row until he finally made a move and kissed me (which was very surprising, because I assumed he would be very afraid of taking that risk as my manager). We've formed a really deep connection and have had a lot of fun over the last few days together, but everything with my ex is still very fresh. My heart is still occupied by a lot of hurt, which wouldn't be fair to him if he wanted a relationship right away (I've voiced all this to him). He told me he's perfectly okay not getting into a relationship right now, although he's extremely warm, affectionate and thoughtful (he makes me breakfast every morning, asks me all the time how I feel about things when he never does that with anyone else, wants to hang out with me all the time, etc).

So here are my questions:
1) I really do like him, but I would hate to hurt him by not being as emotionally available as him for a while. Do you think that would be painful for an ISTJ?
2) I thought I had read at some point that ISTJ's are not usually into one-night stands. Just because I'm a female, I always have a concern in the back of my mind that someone is using me sexually and they're going to just drop me out of nowhere. Considering everything, does that seem like a big possibility?
3) How quickly do you guys get emotionally attached to someone, typically? Do you think the fact that he's being so thoughtful, warm and completely ignoring the fact that he could easily lose his job over a sexual relationship with me means he's actually attached already? 

For clarification: I do not intend on hurting him. I very much care about him and I'm trying my absolute best to be as clear as possible. I'm not opposed to a relationship in the future, although I think it qould be irresponsible right now.

Thank you for any constructive advice and insight!",1501641147
ISTJ,"I have been hearing that ISTJs and ESTJs tend to be the least types to ""step into"" illegal drugs. I completely agree with it as my ISTJ friends and I never ever touched the ""illegal ones"" that can cause a huge problem. I did try weed twice when I was a college freshman, but never touched it after I realized that I hate the feeling of getting high.

However, I have mixed feelings about alcohol and cigarettes. I never drank (unless my parents or uncles were present) or smoked until my freshman year in college. I started drinking with no adult's supervision just because all of my friends (including my ethical friends) in college were drinking and felt like alcohol could help me socializing with other people. I did not drink often as I did not want alcohol to disturb my studying and hated socializing with 10+ strangers at fraternity parties. However, I liked the concept of getting drunk that whenever I drank with a small group of my friends , I drank until I either pass out or vomit. After getting ""fucked up"" multiple times, I realized that I do not really enjoy myself getting drunk anymore and decided to control myself. While doing so (and still), I started to estrange myself from all those parties and huge scenes of socialization where alcohol is involved and began to drink alone or with my friends only. I usually (unless I am extremely stressed out) stop at 2 or 3 bottles of beer and rarely (unless I am with my friends) drink heavy alcohol. The only problem at this moment is that I drink beer very often (3-4 times a week) as I realized that 2 or 3 cans of beer do not really disturb my work and studying. I obviously do not drink if I have a huge task/exam soon.

I started smoking when I was 18. I do not remember how I started it exactly, but probably because I was extremely stressed out. I smoked for the next two years and eventually became a heavy smoker (9-12 cigarettes per day). I decided to quit after I realized that I am a heavy smoker and my friend's father because of lung cancer. Instead of smoking, I started smoking vape as cold turkey did not work for me. I feel like vape makes me feel less guilty as it has no carcinogen, but will try to quit it once I am confident that my body does not need nicotine anymore.

What's your opinion/story with alcohol and cigarettes? I know some ISTJs who are simply addicted to either of the two, some who know how to control themselves, and two or three who never drink after having a bad experience.

ISTJ,"I keep going into too many details with this post so I'll try to keep it on topic. Just really jumbled up right now, had a fight with them about this yesterday. Posted this on r/enfp, but thought I'd post it here too.

I'm 16, ENFP. I want to finish highschool (UK system, A levels if you've heard of it) within next year with the best grades possible. I have issues with time management (I don't procrastinate, I just take waaaayyy too long doing things, still not sure how to handle that) but I try.

Now, I have much deeper issues. Almost killed myself a few months ago because depression shit, my sleep schedule has always been fucked since I was a child and at the moment I either stay up 24 hours straight working or get really depressed for whatever reason and sleep all day just to avoid the pain, I'm talking 18 hours of sleep here. My diet is HORRIBLE. I've gone days without eating during exam time because I couldn't think of anything but studying, I'm pretty sure the only reason I'm alive is because of my mother leaving a plate of food for me on the table. And when I do eat it's usually junk because I never have the energy or the time to cook anything.

Anyway. 

So, my ESFJ mother has to pay for each exam I give + tuition, and it's a bit on the expensive side as I'm studying under the british education system in a third world country. Money is a bit tight for my family at the moment, so I could understand if it takes me longer to finish highschool than other people since then it would be less of a strain on my mother. I'm currently working as a teacher's assistant and as soon as I get the qualifications I'll apply to local schools to help pay for what I can. I really really want to finish highschool quickly so I can take some time off to deal with my problems and then apply to uni, without ending up being that one older kid in class (not that that's a bad thing, I just don't want to).

But money isn't exactly the problem here. My mother can pay, it will be difficult, but she can pay for me to finish by 2019 instead of say, 2020. But she doesn't want to.

My ESTJ sister wants me to take high school very slowly, much slower than my peers do, because of the issues I have that I described above. She is 26, has a great job and she would gladly help out with my education but she does not believe that she should help me at all because I am not doing things the 'right way', which is sleeping on time, not studying for insane hours, eating right and also not sleeping for insane hours and missing classes because of it. She will not support me because she believes she has no reason to because of these problems I have, and my ESFJ mother will not support me either until my sister does.

What do I do? What can I possibly do? I can't fix these things, I've had them for years. I understand now would be the best time to fix them and fixing them would give me better results without destroying my brain and my body, but every time I try I end up failing the very next week. I don't have the energy to try anymore. I don't want to. I would rather work till I'm braindead than be efficient and work slowly.

I don't have much leeway with them aside from my grades, which have been straight As so far, and word from my teachers, who all think I'm an excellent student besides missing classes occasionally. But when I bring these up to my sister she just says that I shouldn't get too cocky/arrogant and none of it matters because I didn't do it the 'right way'.

How do I get out of this? Please, I really don't want the way I am now to fuck up my future or the things I want to do. It's just fucking high school, you study, you pass. I'm trying my best, I understand I'm making mistakes but I wish they would just let me suffer for making them instead of forcing me not to make them by taking things away.",1501608941

My father is 57-years-old and is the kind of person who (1) gets up at the same time every day, (2) goes through the same morning routine, (3) goes to the office and works way too hard at a business he owns, even though he doesn't really need to financially, (4) comes home and looks for extra work to do around the house, and gets annoyed if he can't find any, then (5) pretends to watch TV in his chair as he slowly drifts to sleep while acting like he is not drifting to sleep.

It is going to mess with his head being bedridden even for a short while. I myself love to binge Youtube videos, but most videos I've shown him are not the type he enjoys (it makes sense that videos on the mysterious nature of quantum mechanics would be super engaging to an ENTP, but perhaps not as much to an ISTJ who has no interest in physics).

Any suggestions on some channels, or just general video/media ideas, I can show to him? He almost never goes on Youtube (or really even the internet), so nothing you recommend will be something he has seen.

ISTJ,"I see, over on INTJ that there is a lot of confusion between these 2 sub-types and I'm looking to clear it up for my own mind, using some of my own experiences/feelings.
I *feel* and *think* I am more closely associated with INTJ (but, again, I think many do or at least *want* to for its description, w/o giving much thought to functions themselves).

But, our Te function seems to create a strong similarity, especially when applied towards 'work' or problem solving.

So, on topic: I do not care about nor follow most traditions/religions, I was raised Christian, but as early as a teen I lost most respect for religion in general because it seemed (felt to *me*) like I was just 'blindly following' what a bunch of people (writers of the bible and such) said is to be so...the way...the truth. So, I played along, wore my mask, obeyed as long as I had to, until I grew up enough to make my own choices and decide how to spend my time.  Currently, I'd consider myself mostly agnostic, but I continue to research religion and philosophy, often searching for 'what ""good"" can I take from this' and apply it towards my own life.  This curiosity has led me primarily to Eastern religion and philosophy. Meditation has helped a lot recently, thus my interests in knowing more about the cultures/traditions that it originates from; Who they are, what they are, how they are, and what have they done for the universe? My understanding is; I'm fine letting you believe what you want to, as long as you allow me to believe what I  want to.  So, this is not meant to bash or make judgement towards a persons *own* choice or belief. 

I'm not keen on having *too many* rules/regulations, and limiting or stagnating ideas and evolution of a thing/person/environment/field of study/etc.  I often welcome alternate ideas and pov, at least for consideration; for the data aspect of it; to see how others perceive their universe.

I do not do/keep track of birthdays (not even my own), or holidays. I don't like to *celebrate* (make a big fuss about) things, and prefer to instead make each day unique/special in its own way.

I've worked in some environments with a strong political hierarchy and had very little interest in 'playing along' (sucking up/impressing or 'doing the time'  others higher up the chain for example) in order to advance up the so called ladder.  I much prefer we be equals towards one another, expressing and sharing ideas, collaborating. (This train of thought broke down/was interrupted...and re-reading it appears poorly expressed. Yep, I'll even share my broken ideas. ;))

ISTJ,"I (INFP, 23) was with a ISTJ (F20) for about 4 months. It was her first relationship and my 2nd one. My last relationship was very turbulent with my ex cheating on me and so it's taken some time for me to feel ready to date again. This relationship felt very different, she was always very honest with me and I really loved the stability.

She broke up with me because although it was 'nice', she said she wanted to experience the feeling of a spark. She said we could still be friends though. This came out of the blue for me and I did not take it very well -  I became very emotional and persistent on changing her mind. My behaviour upset her very much and I am also ashamed of myself for not being able to keep my composure. She is a very private and a fairly withdrawn individual. She said it was the first time someone close had been that emotional/persistent and that it was overwhelming.

I apologised immediately after and we have been talking as friends, but she no longer responds as much. It's been a couple months and I've tried to accept everything that has happened and really want to be proper friends now. Although she was extremely comfortable with me in the past, she told me that she now has trouble/feels reluctant talking to me because she immediately associates me with memories of the breakup, which makes me feel even more guilty.

I really want to know what I can do to try and remedy this. What would help her no longer connect me with bad feelings and feel more comfortable with me? I really value having this person in my life and so i dont want to just cut ties. I have fears that time and space might make us drift more and even consolidate the memory. What have people around you guys done to redeem themselves in your eyes after a negative incident? Or is there anything you wish someone would have done?

While you can pretty much post any song you want, memes related to music, news about music, anything related to music except self promotion.

ISTJ,"Female ENFP here seeing male ISTJ. I've been seeing him for about 6 weeks. We spend a great deal of time together(on dates or just hanging out), I've met his friends, and we have great sex. In the beginning we had a couple of""misfires"" in communication, so to speak, due to our personality type differences. But since then, I bought and read a few books on introverts-I really like this guy- and our communication has been quite smooth. He's expressed he's looking for a serious relationship in the past...and I'm definitely ready to call him my boyfriend. 

Thing is- I know ENFPs like myself are pretty intense and I don't want to move too fast for him and scare him off, as he contemplates all kinds of desicions for lengthy periods. I know no two individuals are the same, but I was hoping to get some insight from other ISTJs on the timeline of when they decide to commit to a new partner, as well as if I should intiate ""the talk"" or if I should give him some time to bring it up to me. At this current time, even though I know what I want, I'm comfortable giving him some space (a couple of more weeks, maybe?) to work out whatever he needs to in his head, if that'd be beneficial, but I don't know if I'm just over-thinking it.

Se-users are often described as indulgent and hungry for new experiences but what about Si-users?

With tertiary Si I can't fully make sense of it but I noticed that I almost never like something (food, music) the first time I try it. Only after processing the new sensations in my mind can I decide that I like it and only after longing for something for a while can I fully enjoy it.

ISTJ,"What is your opinion of so-called ""ambiverts""? (aka people who are both introverted AND extroverted)

I call bullshit.

I propose ""ambiverts"" are just extroverts with poor social skills. For instance, an ""ambivert"" goes to a large New Years Eve party, feels awkward they don't know anyone there, and come home feeling sad and drained. They convince themselves this is ""introversion"" because their perfect party would have been small and full of lots of attention from close friends.

Meanwhile, us introverts are exhausted by people. Even our favorite people. We want to cancel every hour leading up to the party and firmly believe home alone with internet/Netflix beats any party.

(Also, we probably made an excuse and cancelled last minute. If we did show up, it's because we cancelled the last 8 times before that.)

While socializing is an incredibly difficult skill to master for 99% of the population (damn that 1%), I still believe ambiverts (aka extroverts) can gain more enjoyment out of social events with enough practice at being charming.

Meanwhile, introverts are not going to enjoy extended conversations with other people, even if it's a party where we are the guest of honor and universally thought to be charming and wonderful.",1500162118

ISTJ,"Hey guys, needing a bit of help reading an ISTJ guy I've been seeing; I'm an INFJ/ENFJ. 

Everything started pretty well with him, he was initiating conversations and communicating frequently. First date was fantastic etc, and we spent a fair bit of time together a few weeks after (3-4 days straight), followed by some casual dinner dates (this was all in the first 1.5 months). Communication was pretty much the same throughout this time. 

However, his work has recently gotten extremely hectic, with very long hours and some travel. In the last week he's had to fly interstate and handle a lot of issues (he's a manager), and his schedule is early starts and not getting out until past midnight - rinse and repeat. He also hasn't had any time off in nearly two weeks. 

I know how much stress/pressure he's under, so I've been messaging to check in and sending encouragement. During the last week he's been responding every day, but slower and in shorter sentences, and taking much longer than usual to get back to me (most likely due to nonstop work/no phone time?). I've appreciated the effort he's made to remain in touch despite the stress. However, in the last few days, it's been radio silence. 

I'm beginning to worry / wonder if I'm annoying him or if he's losing interest, or if he's simply just over-stressed and beyond exhausted to reach out/respond. I don't want to push him over the edge or anything, since it's a new relationship and we're both taking it slow.

Is this disappearing / distancing ""typical"" of ISTJs? How do you guys handle stress and communication in times of stress? Is there anything I can do to help the situation?

I read on many websites that careers like marketing, public relations, event management should be avoided by ISTJs due to their unstable nature and high social interaction.

HOWEVER, those careers, ie public relations, communications, marketing, are highly desired by me. I think it's because I have a strong desire for ""attention"" and ""validation"". I feel through those ""fancy"" careers, I receive attention through daily interaction with various people at work and those jobs also give me the opportunity to prove myself and earn recognition. I believe the desire for attention may come from my strict upbringing where my parents had not attended to my emotional needs well while constantly requesting me to perform well.

Adding to that, I'm not passionate or excited about careers usually suggested for ISTJs like accounting, legal, finance AT ALL.


So my questions are:
1. What are other explanations to my desire for those ""fancy"" careers?
2. How do I know whether they are really a good or bad fit for me?
3. If they are not a good fit for me, how do I fulfill my desire to get ""attention"" on my day-to-day job and desire for a ""fancy job""? ",1498817552
ISTJ,"When it comes to parenting, are you likely to support or oppose it? From a child's point of view? From a parent's point of view? 

I ask because theoretically, it would seem to be more tolerable among XSTJ types due to their ability to set feelings aside when accepting someone's decision after evaluating its logical consistency. 

Of course there are exceptions, like the time I had a XSTJ professor try to provide for me emotional support (even if it were not to come directly from her) when I started opening up to her about my addiction problems. Never received the preachy lectures I often got from my father in which I was told ""you'll hate me now but love me later."" 

But from an XSTJ kid's standpoint, even though they like to adhere to structure and order, naturally kids are going to be curious and want to experience the world on their own, good or bad. They may appear to be rebelling, but in most cases they're probably unaware and do not fully understand that what they're doing is considered wrong and let the curiosity take over. For an ISTJ, I sure did get into a lot of trouble, and I point my fingers towards my need to understand foreign experiences.

Quick backstory:
We're around the same age (I'm 27, he's 24) and met unexpectedly at work. I usually don't even notice others since I'm very focused at work. He comes off as very friendly, professional, mature, and these traits made him stand out to me. What made me become interested was how he introduced himself to me, often seemed happy to see me, seemed overly helpful, and was very polite. He comes off as very introverted and incredibly shy as well. It took some time, but he eventually asked for my number, which I later found did require some help from an additional co-worker to encourage him. I could tell he was terrified when he asked for my number (I saw his hands shaking mildly), but it went well. We texted often after that.

We met up in person twice so far. First time, movie date which I thought he didn't even like but later in a text told me he had alot of fun. He even tried to hold my hand, which seemed to come out of nowhere. It's hard to read him, lol. Second time, his place and things got kinda ""hot"" but we didn't go all the way. He even asked before I left if I was busy the next weekend, I said I would check my schedule.

So, it's been about a month since we last got together. After our second date, he seemed to ""disappear"" (stopped texting me) which really confused me and emotionally hurt even, then I've consistently been getting a cycle of Saturday 1am texts from him asking if I could come over Sunday. I'm assuming these are drunk texts? Why is he asking me out at 1am instead of just scheduling ahead of time?

I've also initiated several times to hang out with him and he often says he has other obligations (family gatherings usually) and starts apologizing ALOT. I'm trying to take him at face value and give him the benefit of the doubt.

I've found that I've developed some feelings for this guy, which is something that I honestly feared. I've initiated hanging out with him several times and gotten blown off. It hurts. I guess I'm just wondering if he even likes me or was I just another conquest (he doesn't seem like that type but maybe he's put up a great facade)? At this point, I'd rather just know the truth and move on. I would feel much better knowing he just wanted to hookup or already had another girl, rather than complete silence or leading me on. He keeps saying he's busy, but he does tell me when he's free. It also often seems like I have to initiate the conversation first, or ask to hang out, etc. Is this normal with ISTJ guys?

TLDR; INTJ girl pursues very shy ISTJ guy, 2 dates go well. ISTJ guy allegedly gets busy and says he can't hang out with INTJ girl due to family events. ISTJ guy keeps apologizing and seems to stop talking as much INTJ girl. INTJ girl is confused and begins to think ISTJ doesn't really like her, or just sees her as a ""hookup.""

I really like him but it seems he's avoiding me, and I don't know why. I'd just like some closure I guess and he doesn't seem to like talking about himself or expressing what he's thinking. Is this guy on player level 99 or something or just really obligated to work and family?

Backstory:

Two weeks ago I met this ISTJ at a group hang out of mutual friends. I sat next to him and we immediately. He was very open and friendly and picked on me in the best way. It was like he fit right in. He said he was a stats major and I was intrigued. As the night closed I said, ""I WANT TO BE YOUR FRIEND! Can I be your friend?"" And he added me on Facebook. THEN as I was leaving I said, ""oh do you know your MBTI?"" And he said yes and had it readily available in his email. 

I excitedly messaged him that night and also asked if he would help me with some homework. I rambled and got nervous and sent a bunch of messages. 

He smoothly responded as if I hadn't been all spazzy and came over after work for 5 hours. 

Later that day I asked him randomly, ""are you happy?"" And he answered sincerely. 

We banter and I send way too many messages and invite him all the time to things. But he initiates too. 

He spends hours with me and we talk about so much. I ask him questions and he rarely understands what I'm asking the first time because they are often abstract concepts. 

Tonight we both discussed the fact we've never trusted anyone so quickly. I told him I enjoyed that he never pressures me. I decided to be vulnerable and told him that I enjoy our friendship so much and that, honestly, i was glad he didn't pressure me to think if we should date. I said words of affirmation is one of my primary love languages and ""I was afraid I would say something and he would think I'm hitting on him."" And I added, ""not that I WOULDN'T, but I like that he doesn't pressure me."" 

He told me he trusts me and feels like I get him. That he enjoys listening to me and the way I talk. He said everything I talk about is interesting. That I make him think. 

Necessary added info:

I'm an ENFP with a highly developed Te

All my closest friends are INT/ENTJ's (and one ISFJ)

He's quite good looking, but I'm demisexual so right now I'm just in the ""your face isn't weird at all"" phase. üòä 

He always asks me open ended questions. 

Questions:

Could it be he likes me romantically?

If so, should I let him make the first move?

How should I word existential and abstract questions so that he better understands what I'm asking?

Does age difference matter a lot to y'all?

I also must add that over the past few years I've been recovering from severe depression that has since transitioned into a more mild form. This might be the actual culprit, but I cannot be entirely sure as my depression has not been interfering with my life and goals lately. ",1497368044

ISTJ,"I'm a male ENFP and I have a huge crush on a female ISTJ in my class. She's smart, reliable and our conversation feels so incredibly natural. We've known each other for quite a while (3 years) and I only recently developed feelings for her. 
(I'm demisexual if that matters). She also seems to like me too.

The thing is, I'm afraid that our differing natures will lead to conflict in a relationship. I grew up with an ISTJ (my older sister) and we've always had a bit of an odd relationship of being extremely close and at the same time very different. My desire for freedom and her desire for scheduled order has lead to a lot of arguments over the years. I'm afraid the same problems will develop if I choose to actually pursue my crush.

So here I am, asking advice from the people who think the way she thinks. I would love to hear any input you guys have, especially from those of you who have dated other ENFPs.

I'm a socially inept potato.

ISTJ,"Hello everyone,

I have a huge crush on this girl at my part-time job (at a restaurant(, but the issue is that we rarely talk to each other for two reasons:
- We work at the same time about twice a month
- She works in the dishes, while I work in the kitchen, and there are around 15-20 people working on one day. The only chance I have talking to her is when I personally bring dishes to the dishwashers (they are always with 4 people).

I don't see her anywhere else than at work. The only chance I might have is at the annual party which our boss hosts, but that means I've to wait half a year and I might not even have a chance to talk to her then.

So really do not know what to do, should I just try to stop thinking about her or so I try and get all my courage into talking with her on the rare times that I see her,  which is a hard thing to do for an ISTJ, she is also very shy. Dating is also not really a thing for people of my age and in my country (17, Netherlands), so thats not an option.

This might be the first time in many years that I've developed a crush on someone, so I really have a feeling that I should at least try to make something out of it, but it's pretty complicated as you've might just read.

Any advice? I will greatly appreciate it...

ISTJ,"Insight would be nice, this issue has got me bothered to the point that I can't sleep. As a result I'm sorry if this is a little long. I'm an ISFJ in love with an ISTJ, and his signals are the absolute worst. I know ISTJs are not ones to admit feelings and are afraid to show any love, but he is so hot and so cold I can't figure out if there is something here or not. We dated for 2 months and broke up, honestly, over a misunderstanding. He thought I was pushing him to be my boyfriend when he wasn't ready, which I wasn't, so we mutually broke up. That doesn't stop us from being friends and playing video games a lot, and occasionally flirting. He rarely initiates conversation but replies quickly, and then will initiate if I don't talk to him for a few days with a random youtube video or something. He'll send me selfies and comment to me in passing how pretty I am, but in a round about way. For example he'll say I look like Sigrun Mercy from Overwatch (which I do) and five minutes later comment on how she's super pretty. He volunteers to do computer stuff for me all the time. I thought he liked me, then when I ask him about what we're doing a month or so ago he says something like we're super attracted to each other, we're great on paper, but he doesn't feel a spark. Fine, got the message, moving on. Fast forward to two weeks ago.

Two weeks ago we started flirting again pretty heavily, which I thought was odd if he turned me down. I was the initiator in that flirting, but an ISTJ would shut down my flirting if not interested, right? He then started initiating more conversation and suggesting we get together to do a variety of activities (movies, bar, gun range), then shoots me down when I ask for a time and date. I even asked him straight up at one point (cause you like directness... correct?) if my flirting with him was unwanted or overboard. He simply replies ""nope"" and acts like nothing happened.

ISTJs... am I dumb, does this guy not like me, or does he like me and is terrified? I feel like he doesn't like me but our friends are convinced that he does.",1495598442

ISTJ,"So there's someone close to me with Asperger's who I also just found out is an ISTJ. She had all the symptoms as a child and adolescent, but in adulthood she's worked really hard to behave as a neurotypical person would and now mostly just has aggression and anxiety. For the longest time I thought that Asperger's accounted for her other personality quirks, but I now think they might be typical of the ISTJ type. I just don't know. For example, if anyone is ever a minute late for an appointment, it can send her into a fit of rage and anxiety so intense you'd think something truly terrible happened. Also, she has a lot of trouble empathizing and expressing compassion (even trouble knowing and expressing her own emotional reasoning), or understanding where other people are coming from emotionally or in terms of a personal value system. She is fixated on a particular view of the world, with very rigid morality based partly on conventional morality, partly on a few subjective experiences (that must be tertiary Fi?) and partly on things that people she respects have told her. She seems unable to come up with an original moral structure to live by, has no internal compass. Not to say she is immoral--quite the opposite--just that there's no flexibility at all to her beliefs. As an INFP this confuses me, because refining my ideals and tuning my moral compass is a full-time occupation for me. This frustrates her to no end, of course, because change is extremely frustrating to her (maybe the hardest thing for her to cope with). Anyway, is in-the-moment moral reasoning and empathy a struggle for all ISTJs?",1494704328
ISTJ,"So, I don't know if I'm growing up or something, but lately I've seen a serious need for stability in my life, maybe because I'm suffering from the consequences of not having much of it. Also have some issues with depression and incredibly fucking unhealthy Fi (already hated myself for 3 years of my life but it's starting to affect others around me because I'm becoming selfish, resentful and doing dumb shit like not talking to some guy who was in love with me because I upset him for 5 minutes and I felt like shit about that). But don't mind that, I'll be going to therapy next month. But for now, general stuff!

Being an ENFP, I'm guessing it's time for me to develop Te and Si. Since you guys are naturals at these two functions, I thought I'd ask here. I think my Te is doing somewhat alright, getting the highest possible marks in my classes and all, so I don't have any problems with procrastination I guess. I get done what I feel I need to. Buut

I've noticed the STJs in my life just seem to have everything under control naturally, they try not to get emotionally attached to things they know can break/be lost and they don't even feel bad about it, they have an actual routine to how they live their lives which they follow to a T, and the only time I've ever seen them distressed is when the routine they've catered to themselves cannot be followed, or when they're dealing with something new, something they don't understand and haven't planned for.

This is something that seems wonderful to me after living the opposite kind of life. I know this stuff will never come naturally to me, but surely it is something I can develop, at least?

The little idealist in me wants to find an ISTJ partner who will help me grow in this aspect, maybe I'll love him so much that even the thought of breaking a routine between would be unfathomable to me because it would hurt him, and that practice would aid me in developing my own routines. Maybe his cold rational nature could help soothe the emotional chaos in my head so I would stop getting hurt over silly things, silly events, silly people. But of course, that's a load of crap and it's completely implausible, and I know I'm completely alone if I want to make anything better, especially for myself. Not only that, it would be incredibly unfair to just drag someone else into my mess just because I'm having trouble fixing it. But... I dunno. Lemme know where you guys tend to hang out, maybe? Probably a horrible idea until I get therapy and get my shit together.

But anyway, getting to the actual point, do you guys have any tips or pointers at all for developing these two functions? Anything that could help a young and really dumb ENFP with the issues that I have? Where do I find you guys once I get better and can have something meaningful that benefits both of us?

ISTJ,"I am 22 years old and for the past two years I've been pretending to be something similiar to an enfp.

I've been locked in my room for most of my growing up by myself. Because I was totally terrified of society because of my parents, school, whatever.. I've been playing a lot of video games and been pretty good at it.

Then I became 18, here were forced to join the army, and boy what a ride that was. After that ended I really felt lonely and scared as fuck, I wasn't as interesting in gaming anymore, no job, and didn't want to start learning anything yet. Most of all I felt like I had a lot to learn...  so I spent the past 2 years around 2 now very close best friends that have introduced me to a lot of people and experiences! They're both INFPs btw and I felt like they really helped me develop my feeling and sensitivity.

Those experiences and adventures made me develop this weird personality where I am super nice and interested in everything and I am super jumpy and laughs about everything. Not that it's not real but its usually over the top exaggerated. No one knows this because they think thats just how I am. I told you guys, I can do ENFP so well I tested myself on MBTi, I discovered the test around 4 months ago and did it a couple of times. I would get ENFP and would relate with it for the most party.

NONE of this felt fake or unreal to me, I felt honest, I was kind of fooled by myself.

Then a bunch of stuff happened, I basically realized I was conforming to society. I was not putting all of myself out there. And even if I was I was still not being real to me but to this character I created.

This has taught me how to be an extrovert, and also develop my feelings and sensitivity, social tact empathy A LOT MORe!! It's been a heck of a ride.
NOW I am learning to let go and just be me. I do not need to please anyone. I am enough. With all my weirdness and introversy.

ISTJ,"Hi everyone,

I'm an INFJ woman who just started texting with an ISTJ guy, whom I was introduced via mutual friends. We actually have not met yet, he got my number and reached out, and we've been texting about every other day for about two weeks.

Due to both of our work, we haven't found a time to meet yet, but we plan to meet in exactly one week.

I'm a bit confused yet curious about the way this ISTJ texts. He's consistent in that he'll answer all my questions pretty promptly, within 2-4 hours, which is pretty good for his job, which doesn't allow him to be on the phone much (medical residency, working 70+ hours/week).

What I find puzzling is that he doesn't really ask any personal questions, or the ""getting to know"" questions. He does ask what my schedule is like probably because he's trying to figure out a time to meet. But there's very little ""warmth"" in the texts, meaning no joking around or asking friendly questions or asking about me, the person. Questions he asks are like, when do you get off, when does your graduate program end, etc. As a woman, I do get tired of coming up with more ""fun"" questions sometimes... and I'm also more used to the man initiating most questions :/ I guess I'm a bit conventional. 

Do you relate? Is this pretty normal for ISTJs?

Is.. he interested? lol.

ISTJ,"**sorry for the typo in the headline, it should be named""ISTJ parent"" 

I'm 27F, ENFP and I have recently been diagnosed with ADHD. I want to tell my ISTJ mother about it, not only because I want her to know about it, but also for the reason being that she probably has ADHD herself and I want her to get some testing done herself.

My only problem in this situation is that she immediately shuts down when I start talking about _anything_ mental health related and she always shuts it done with the annoying ""This is only made up for economic reasons, you can get your life together just by getting your shit together"" argument.
I have studied Psychology myself for several years and I have only recently found out about ADHD in myself, because symptoms and behaviors differ a lot in women with ADHD compared to men. I learned a lot about those in the last few weeks and I am in the process of finding the right combination of therapy and medication. But since I got my diagnosis I managed a lot better and I saw so many improvements in all the life areas I struggled a lot with previously: time management, University exams, keeping a job for more than a few months, organization and household chores, remembering things, and even simple things as getting shopping groceries done...

I thought about giving her a copy of my psychologist's five pages testing and diagnosis summary, but I am not sure that this might 
be of any help. I have come some neuroscience studies about ADHD from this year, which show that ADHD patient's brains are in fact different than in non-ADHD people... Maybe that would help to convince her? Facts and statistics? 

I'm so emotional about this topic, because I've seen my mum struggle a lot and a lot of her weird behavior (obsessive tendencies, emotional dysregulation, not being able to listen to me for longer than 10 seconds, losing a lot of keys/phones/wallets/you name it, struggling with studying for her language classes, struggling in her programming job, etc.) all seem to make sense to me now after doing a lot of research about ADHD in women per se.

I think I might actually prefer not to sign up for extracurricular activities at all than sign up and miss some practices, classes, and whatever else. I hate being unreliable. If I say I'm going to be somewhere then I'm going to be there.

What do you think? Do any other ISTJs identify with this? If you do have uncertain schedules, how do you deal with it?

(Note: for this summary, we will be using the term ""[extravert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraversion_and_introversion)"" as used in clinical analysis initiated by Carl Jung instead of the popularized spelling, ""extrovert."" )

# Introduction

The Movers &amp; Makers company is engaged in ongoing research about introverts, extraverts, age, occupation, and communication preferences. The original hypothesis was that introverts, or individuals in introvert-friendly occupations such as STEM, were more adverse to having a phone call disrupt their time, with some exceptions. In contrast, extraverts, or individuals in extravert-friendly occupations, were more open to phone calls. Our formal interviews showed this hypothesis to be incorrect and revealed a trend based more on age and occupation than temperament.

As an informal triangulation of our data, The Movers &amp; Makers research team decided to conduct surveys on popular social media and internet forums. The research has not yet concluded, but ""Phase 1"" of these informal surveys are complete and we'd like to share the results of these surveys. The results of this informal survey coincided with our formal research and also contradicted the original hypothesis. This summary is not an analysis of our hypothesis, our formal research, or of the informal research. This summary is only a brief overview of the informal survey results.

# Summary

In addition to essential demographic questions, the questions of the survey took the form of ""I work for a company that has never done business with you and I'd like to introduce myself."" The possible answers included, ""Call your phone number,"" ""Send you an email,"" ""Send you an SMS,"" ""Send you an MMS,"" and ""Send you an IM."" We also asked two, somewhat open-ended questions that emphasized the positive and negative consequences of the communication preferences.

## Overall Preferences

Our initial observations, which initiated our research, were that there are some people that don't like to be called on the phone and would prefer to be contacted by other means. This survey supported the observation with less than a third of respondents preferring  a phone call (31.3%) over alternative methods. Email was the preferred method by half of the respondents (49.6%).

[Overall Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/UmRoBq3)

Granted, the spectrum of scenarios may have been biased toward phone-call-aversion, so this is not an absolute reflection of preferences, but merely a summary of the preferences reflected in this survey. 

### Introvert-Extravert Preferences

Breaking down the data between introverts and extraverts yielded an insignificant difference between the two temperaments. Introverts preferred a phone call in 30.61% of responses. Extraverts preferred a phone call in 31.41% of responses. This is a difference of only 0.8% and is much smaller than we anticipated.

[Introvert Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/p7S4Djk)

[Extravert Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/9eww0um)

The similarities between introvert and extravert coincide with our formal research and are also reflected in the breakdown of most of each questions that follow.

#### Ambivert Preferences

While ""ambivert"" is not a part of some personality/temperament models, many contemporary research make allowances for ambiverts. In our case, we are including the term because people that identify as ambiverts seem themselves as distinct from both extraverts and introverts and they may have a distinct profile. However, the number of respondents describing themselves as Ambiverts is too small to comprehensively study and we recommend a more in-depth study of ambiverts and communication preferences.  Still, as a note of interest, we'll include the results here, though we caution against drawing any conclusions. Ambiverts responded with a preference for email at 54.6% and phone calls at 19.2%.

[Ambivert Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/5CHYPha)

### Male-Female Preferences

Our original hypothesis did not account for sex or gender. We allowed for the selection of ""sex"" in the survey to satisfy any curiosity of biological temperament selection. As we suspected, there isn't a large or significant difference in correlation of sex to communication preferences as borne out in our formal research and reflected in these survey results.

[Male Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/VeC5EeV)

Overall, male respondents selected a preference for a phone call in 34% of responses with females selecting phone calls in only 28.6% of responses. Email was the preferred response for both males and females in 49.3% and 49.7% of responses respectively.

[Female Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/Npq6ZeS)

#### Gender and Non-traditional Genders

We specifically did not include the word ""gender"" in this survey because the study of gender is outside of the scope of our current research. We allowed for the answers of ""Prefer not to say,"" and ""Other"" with an open field to promote the completion of the survey, but this survey is not equipped to tackle gender. Even with this allowance, only 0.1% of respondents answered with a non-traditional sex. Of that 0.1%, some of the respondents showed open hostility to the survey in their comments, indicating that this answer was not truly reflective of the respondent. The answers from these respondents were removed from our analyzed results.

That does not mean, however, that we do not value research regarding gender. We believe that the identification of gender and that correlation to communication preference might be quite significant. It is simply that we have not begun to tackle the question at this time. We would openly welcome input or recommendations from anyone with knowledge or expertise in this area.

### Generational Preferences

The first of two areas with distinctive responses is the difference in generation. The age groups that we call ""Millennials"" are the least resistant to phone calls, with 31.6% of responses, and yet 48.4% of the Millennial responses prefer email. Millennials were also more open to ""alternative"" communication methods such as IM, SMS, etc. with about 20% of the responses in total.

[Millennial Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/fJBFPKj)

The age groups that we call ""Generation X,"" or ""Gen X,"" are slightly more resistant to phone calls with only 29.1% of responses preferring a phone call and 57.3% preferring email.

[Gen X Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/mAotSZr)

The age groups that we call ""Baby Boomers,"" or just ""Boomers"" are the most resistant to phone calls with only 23.6% of responses preferring a phone call and 72.7% preferring email. Boomers were the most resistant to ""alternative"" communication methods with only 3.6% of responses for SMS and zero responses for the other methods.

[Boomer Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/U7Yng1Z)

### Occupational Preferences

The second of two areas with distinctive responses is the difference in occupation, or, occupational ""wings"" as we call them. These wings are simply divided into occupations that are [STEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics)-related and non-STEM-related. The survey results reinforced our formal research and part of our hypothesis that respondents in STEM-related fields are more resistant to phone calls than their non-STEM peers. Respondents in STEM-related fields responded with 23.5% of responses preferring phone calls and 57.4% preferring email.  

[STEM-Related Occupation Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/QnwxZOc)

Responses in non-STEM-related occupations were more receptive to phone calls, but only with 34.2% of the responses and 46.7% preferring email.

[non-STEM-Related Occupation Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/LMluzrF)

## Scenario Preferences

We asked respondents to imagine a range of hypothetical scenarios and how they'd prefer to be contacted in those scenarios. The scenarios spanned a variety of business-oriented communications that fall onto a spectrum what we term ""cold to hot"" in order indicate the amount of familiarity the two parties have already established. We also asked about preferences in various degrees of urgency and responsibility.

It is probably unsurprising that the more distant and less urgent relationships are the most resistant to phone calls and the nearest and more urgent relationships are the most receptive to phone calls. In the ""coldest"" scenario, *I work for a company that has never done business with you and I'd like to introduce myself*, responses were predictably low on preferring a phone call with only 8% of responses and 85% preferring email. In this scenario, the differences between introvert and extravert were negligible, but the differences in generation were in-line with the overall responses. STEM and non-STEM responses were also in agreement with the overall responses.

[Cold Business Introduction Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/65J1a3r)

Also, predictably, the ""hottest"" scenario, *I have an emergency (business emergency, not life or death)*, included 74.6% of responses favoring a phone call and 5.9% preferring email. As an interesting note, in this scenario, more respondents preferred SMS to email with 13.7% of the responses.

[Emergency Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/IOxd25R)

The scenarios that emphasized cool or hot combined with responsibility, however, were a little surprising. For the scenario, *I'm a customer with a question (it's your responsibility to answer customer questions),* the responses were similar to the warm business responses. 19% of responses preferred a phone call for customer questions and 72.2% of responses preferred email.

[Cool Customer Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/2FOARrW)

The scenario, *I'm a customer with a problem (it's your responsibility to handle customer problems),* showed a surprising 61% preferring email and only 31.2% preferring a phone call.

[Hot Customer Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/FbwgWnW)

## Consequences

We were also interested in understanding what impact these preferences have on the communication recipient. We set up a pair of questions in the survey to give respondents a chance to demonstrate the perceived consequences, both positive and negative. The negative consequences include, ""I mostly roll with it--no big deal"" (16.8%), ""I find it irritating and frustrating"" (24.3%), and ""The interruption negatively affects my work"" (16.5%), as well as, ""I may decide not to reply or continue communication"" (17.8%). The most damaging consequences would be ""I lose some respect for the person contacting me"" (7.3%), and ""I may block that person, or mark their contact as 'spam' or 'junk'"" (6.5%).

[Negative Consequences Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/RbL1A2Q)

Conversely, when the respondents' preferences were respected, there were positive consequences, including, ""It helps me manage my schedule"" (14.3%), ""I feel I'm more productive and efficient"" (13.9%), ""I believe I can dedicate the proper amount of attention to the communication"" (21.5%), ""I'm less irritated"" (20%), and ""It reduces my anxiety"" (18.8%).

# Conclusion

Our initial observations were that most people don't like receiving phone calls. Perhaps it's no mystery that the manner in which communication technology evolved puts the telephone front-and-center to business communication. However, our ongoing research shows that most people find phone calls to be disruptive and intrusive. Using the phone as a primary source of communication could be damaging to business relationships and to the overall economic health of our collective society. 

Looking at this research, we can see why ""cold calling"" feels ineffective and like ""a waste of time"" to many people. ""Cold emails"" are more likely to be effective and seem to have a lower downside. In fields like recruiting, it may be damaging for the hiring side of the relationship to initiate contact with a phone call. 

Yes, the research is ongoing, but it seems relatively clear that the phone should not be the first point of contact in any scenario, unless we know for certain that the recipient would prefer a phone call or we know for certain that the purpose of the contact is an emergency (the definition of ""emergency"" is somewhat subjective and needs to be judiciously applied). In business scenarios, the least risky option for contacting anyone is to use email and the most risky is to use alternative methods like MMS, or even IM. But, phone calls seem equally risky by the same standards considering that email seemed to dominate the responses.

As an illustration of the resistance to phone calls, this is a comment from the survey, ""I hate phone calls, almost unconditionally.  Texting or e-mails are always preferable unless it's really an emergency."" And, another comment, ""I do not generally like speaking on the phone because it's a purely auditory activity, and I am a visual person... I like time to process what's going on and formulate a response, otherwise I feel flustered and anxious."" These and several other comments are reflective of the overall tone of this survey. There were no equivalent comments showing resistance to email. 

Our research currently only analyzes the state of things as they are, not *why* things are as they are. For example, why are Boomers more resistant to phone calls than Millennials? Why are STEM-related occupations more resistant to phone calls than non-STEM-related fields? Why are extraverts as equally resistant to phone calls as introverts? What is the significance of gender in communication preference? How might this study be different if we focused on personal scenarios instead of business scenarios?

All of these questions push us to recommend further research in this area. We know that we are continuing to research this area, but our small contribution covers only a fraction of needed research.

We will begin ""Phase 2"" of this research soon. If you're interested in participating, keep a watch on our blog for updates. This topic will remain a topic of interest for The Movers &amp; Makers Company and our research is ongoing. If you are interested in this research or our other research, please [contact us](mailto:researchers@moversandmakers.xyz); but, please refrain from calling us on the phone, it's so disruptive.

ISTJ,"Hi. I'm new, I am female in case it matters and old (42). I was with my X for 15 years. Took a two year work on me break and now I'm dating. Or theoretically I'm dating as I have not actually been on a date yet. Talking to people first on dating sites is exhausting. I have done it a few times and usually get no response. Or get responses that make it impossible to start a convo.  Only jack offs looking to get laid message me first on dating sites. 

I'm kind of awkward with my jokes. As you can see in my recent history titled ""Why I'm Single"". Irl I am painfully shy. I cannot approach a stranger in a bar and say hi. The only exception is when I am at kink events. I am totally comfortable with my people there and can talk to strangers. However I've met no one in that community who is after the same things I am so there are no potential mates there. But even after these events I need days to recharge. 

I find sitting down for dinner with a stranger daunting so I usually suggest lunch (so I have an easy out if it doesn't go well) or drinks or coffee. 

Anyone else find the whole dating process super frustrating? Any ideas?",1491760768

ISTJ,"I've done the 16 personality tests quite a few times and I seem to get INTJ or ISTJ. I've read around the differences between N and S and I'm looking through here to see what others can type me just by the following things I mention about my self. If there is anything missing that cannot lead you to type me properly please do ask any questions regarding my self.

I value my Independence a lot and more so than others. However, humans do need some form of socializing as we are a social being. Therefore, I would only socialize with my close friends. If i were to socialite with other people it would only be for something that I need. I stay alone most of the time whilst I am at sixth form as my close friends go to another sixth form. I love Maths and Chemistry and so I do stuffs like reading ahead and reading books about these subjects as they fascinate me.

As for my hobbies, they include, playing games like Skyrim, Final Fantasy VII, watching anime (Horror, Slice of Life, Comedy), studying lel, roaming around the internet and working out with my close friends at the gym. I also listen to music such as K-hiphop, Kpop, Jpop, Lofi Hip hop, Indie and Vaporware music etc, pretty much any music that just suits me or any music that I like to be frank.

I do beat my self up alot as I do want to achieve the things that I had planned for the long term (Go to a good university to study maths) and do the necessary things that will get me there. I do compare my self to others alot but I don't necessarily show my emotions and I don't in parituclar show my emotions to my friends and just keep it to my self. And I'm currently going through depression/anxiety because of all this. But I am determined to improve my self and get my self back up to give my self the best possible chance in the future. However, during my lowest days I would end up just watching random videos and withdraw from everything and after that beat my self even more for wasting time. In terms of career wise, I first thought about getting into medicine but I changed my mind as it's far too competitive and I may not even like it as it may be quite demanding also the fact that I don't enjoy Biology A-level anymore and so that put me off from it, (I'm currently self studying further maths) as it seems like the best option to put me. Although my sixth form won't let me study further maths, I decided that I'll just self study it rather than dread biology. In terms of following rules, I first ask my self the point in these rules and whether they are as important as said. If I think it's stupid to follow then I end up not following it. In terms of social/popularity, I tend to follow and listen to my self than whatever is going around other people or follow a certain trend to be liked so yeah. I used to have social media and was quite a narcissists but I stopped after realizing that I need to do things more to my self and not show it to anyone as I feel like I'm just letting them know everything about me. I don't like that. So I deleted social media 2/3 years ago and only keep whatsapp to message my friends.

Generally, I am quite a lazy person and would rather do things efficiently rather than do a routine as it will make me depressed as there is no variety.

In terms of helping other people, I would offer help in terms of emotional problems by listening to them and just thinking what they could do and everything. I'm not really good with these kind of stuffs, especially when girls rant a lot and expect me to say something. Got called a brick because I was too busy thinking the possible solutions that I could offer.

I love dark humor, and as well as that, I really think that in general that this world is pretty shit to live in (Could be my depression talking) but, I really think that we as a whole are pretty much better of being dead, in that way we wouldn't have to feel any pain or any inequalities that happens. And I do question my religious belief a lot to the point where if people know that I'm somewhat agnostic and attempt to give me crap I don't care, as I know that I will suffer or go hell if it were to be the truth.

 Anyways, that's pretty much what I can think of right now.",1490985469
ISTJ,"Hello Everyone,

Have you ever been thinking why you are listening that music genre you are into? I have, so I would like to share my opinion to you. I am going to tell a little story about music in my life then introduce my genre and list some example songs. 

My choice is [Hardstyle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardstyle)

**Affect on my life:**

* I started listening to House and Dance music when I was 3 or 4 years old. My aunt used to listen to those genres and showed me too. The most influential, catchy song was [Mr. Oizo - Flat Beat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmsbP13xu6k) for me back then. I liked how simple and ordered, yet catchy song was it. After years later I listened to Dance music most of the time. Then *I do not remember how* Hardstyle came. 

**Changing genres:**

* It was 2008 and I felt that Mr. Oizo's Flat Beat track ""has evolved"" into this genre. I was completely okay with the fact. The enthusiasm held approximately end of 2012. Dubstep has come. I was shocked to see how complicated, yet so simple. As the various sounds fit together. Disorganized, loud, creative and energetic. I spent two years listening to [Dubstep](https://soundcloud.com/zomboy/never-say-die-vol-59-mixed-by-zomboy) then came it's sub-genre, [Riddim](https://soundcloud.com/crmnls480/mix-2017). If you look at my taste, you will see a downward trend from melodic to raw, aggressive, simple, non-creative, anxious type of music, that was Riddim. I used to listen to only one or two numbers repeatedly in a week. Tried to search new songs, tried to fit in that family, but I found nothing new, ""I minded"" people. Slowly I realised that I missing something. Moreover from time to time I often felt really anxious but then I did not know what is anxiety feels, because never experienced before.

**Meet Hardstyle again:**

* As I wrote above, I felt anxiety. Somehow Riddim music made me anxious during the years.
While I browsing my music folder on my computer I suddenly ran into a folder called ""Hardstyle"". It was very outdated. Last modification happened on 2012. November. I was curious and I gave it a try. After half an hour I felt attuned and started questioning myself *""Why I left Hardstyle? Why? Bloody hell, it is so good!""* I could not tell why the music is so good, but I'm started to feel comfortable with it. The next day I listened those songs again and started thinking. ""What did I do with my life? I wasted so much time. Years! 4 years and 1 month. *(Yes, 2016. December)* I realised that why I fall in love with this genre. Because it is ordered, melodic, predictable, comes from within, creative, does not have too much lyrics, but if some song have lyrics, those are logical, reminds me the good things, easy to memorize and gives a good feeling and good atmosphere to the song. At the first time, I noticed that the drum stands up, and it gives a sense of the whole structured rhythm, which is important in my life to me. And do not forget the melody, which is also organized, but lighten the mood. I started to going to Hardstyle events in my town. Unfortunately, there is no such interest for the genre. So in these events there are quite a few people, like 30-40 people. Safe to say that quite airy the place. When you step in, you see people dancing and smiling. Such a great experience to see the faces and feel you are part of a big family.

**Harmony between the two worlds:**

* After 2013 something changed in this genre. The big artists started to produce more popular sounds to the EDM scene, to make more profit. Some of them completely abandoned this world and moved to EDM. I mean Headhunterz and Showtek. I feel sorry for them.
So I started listening to hardstyle, but I had to search new songs, because as I wrote, my folder was updated a long time ago. Okay, I had the idea to search for artist names and listen their new songs. I have seen with regret that no great progress in their work. I'm not saying that they have worked less, but I wanted something new because I was familiar with those sounds. Alright, so I started listening to mixes. I checked out the tracklists. And faced with new artist names that I never seen before. New names, new opportunities, I thought. After I dug deeper and deeper, I noticed that I used to know as ""Hardstyle"" was split into two sub-genre. Euphoric Hardstyle and Raw Hardstyle. But fortunately there is a little gap between them called NU Hardstyle which combines the two sub-genres, so basically the real Hardstyle with melody and hard kicks. I have a chance to choose between two worlds and I can combine them if I want to.

ISTJ,"Don't get me wrong, my mother has helped me tremendously from her perfectionism and I am forever thankful to her for organizing events and prompting me on things.  However, she needs everything to be completely meticulously planned out, is rarely open to trusting me to schedule my own things, and is rarely open to taking risks or letting anyone else do so.  She also has some pretty serious OCD and past negative life experiences that exacerbate these traits.  I find this to be VERY annoying.  The rest of my family also has trouble dealing with it.  I love my mother very much but there has been too much turmoil and arguments that have come from our constant clash in perspective.  Whenever I try to mention her overbearing nature, she gets very hurt and very defensive about it, to the point where it seems to not be worth the effort.  

How do I explain my concerns to her without hurting her too much?  ",1490672192
ISTJ,"Looking for suggestions on places I can kind of camp out and use wi-fi to work outside of the house for extended periods of time. I honestly can't focus and get distracted easily when working at home.

So far, the places I tend to frequent include the library, coffee shops, panera, barnes and noble, and sometimes certain diners.

Recently my productivity has dropped a lot so I'm looking for new places. Being the introvert that I am, I crave solitude and need to find a place where I can focus and get a lot of work done outside the house. Any suggestions or recommendations?

ISTJ,"I‚Äôm an XNTJ writer here (unsure still if I‚Äôm I or E), and I‚Äôm needing some help with a female ISTJ main character for a story I‚Äôm developing.


I‚Äôm needing help with two things, the first, could any ISTJ‚Äôs in hospitality or management fields tell me what either satisfies you or bothers you about your job, especially how you feel about dealing with people? Anyone who‚Äôs ISTJ, in one of those fields, and loves your job, I‚Äôd especially want to know exactly why and how you decided your job was a good fit for you. I‚Äôm also trying to get a feel for how ISTJ‚Äôs handle conflicting personality types, especially in positions where they have to deal with satisfying a lot of people, especially extroverts, who likely rely more on emotion and intuition.  


Second, does this sound like an ISTJ, and if not, what personality type would you suggest fits more accurately? Fiercely strong / motivating / hard around the edges / goes by the book but surprisingly adaptive when no other options are available / slow to trusting anyone / appears outgoing in that she pretends to care about other‚Äôs problems for her job, but would must rather be alone /=represses most emotions outwardly, yet easily stressed internally / watchful / jack-of-all trades / blames herself when things go wrong. What makes me uncertain is the fact she rather enjoys her not typical ISTJ job (she owns and operates a bar and often takes the listening/comforting role of your average bartender when things are busy, yet she‚Äôs more likely to spend the afternoon playing chess than chatting if she‚Äôs free) and the fact she does take risks when doing things the same old way simply isn‚Äôt working. Does this still sound like an ISTJ or have I diagnosed her wrong? I know no one fits a type 100% which is why I‚Äôm so conflicted here.


Thank you so much ISTJs for all your help. You have no idea how much I appreciate it. :)

ISTJ,"Hello, I'm one of those people who are forever confused about their MBTI type. I've looked a lot into it, looked at the cognitive functions, whatever. I can see myself all over the place. For the past little while I've been pretty consistently getting ISTJ (or ISTp for the socionics stuff) on tests, and my SO has read many profiles and agrees the ISTJ/p ones fit the best. 

I can see ISTJ, it makes sense. There's just some things that seem off to me.  One of the biggest things is how they seem to be aesthetic and dress well. I am pretty apathetic to how things look. I let my SO decide how our house is decorated and I often dress in just comfy clothes. I also have purple hair and tattoos. I don't wear makeup or like to wear dresses. I think I dress like a tom boy for the most part, often sporting a baseball cap with my purple hair just naturally hanging below. 

Also, my rationale for having purple hair is that I always thought coloured hair looked pretty, and I am studying engineering so I know I wont be able to have crazy coloured hair when I am older. I might as well indulge myself now while I still have the chance. My hair isn't super well maintained and it looks pretty faded most of the time, but I find it really fun even looking kinda shitty. I just love the aesthetic of tattoos.. They are all easily hidden however.

Another thing that I really don't relate to is the classic ""J"" traits. I mean, I am bossy and I am never late, but I can be pretty messy and unorganized. I don't care for cleaning and I could easily live in a mess. Obviously, I feel better when my house is cleaner but it isn't a real priority to me. My partner is the one who usually initiates cleaning and he does the bulk of the work.

Where I do see ISTJ in myself has a lot to do with my work ethic. I am a very responsible, dependable person. I am the type of girl who gets her homework assignments done a week before they are due. I currently have a A average, and considering I am studying engineering, that's pretty good (most students are at around a C since most fail a few classes). 

I am the type of person who works really hard. If I am going to do something I give it my all. I'm always highly regarded at my workplaces, I often put too much stress on myself by trying to get everything possible done. However, once I get home I just want to cuddle into the couch and watch tv shows with my SO. 

Another big thing I relate to is having emotional problems. By that, I mean I am incapable of dealing with my emotions well. When I am having a conflict I just close down. I don't understand emotions well, of myself or others, and I would rather never deal with them. I've been called cold by previously partners because of my reluctance to discuss feelings. It just doesn't seem relevant most of the time. My current partner is either a ISTP or ISTJ and we get along super well never talking about our feelings. On the odd occasion we have had to discuss emotions and its like pulling teeth for me. 

I am also extremely reserved. I basically only have 1 friend outside of my relationship and I am perfectly happy that way. However, I am very engaged in class, willing to answer questions and participate in the lectures. When comfortable with people I can be rather talkative and almost silly. I like to fool around and play, but with most people I am very formal. 

At home with my SO, I like to sing, dance, joke, make funny faces and swear. I am a really silly, high energy person when at home with him. He's the only person I am like this with as I am totally comfortable with him (we poop in front of each other).

I don't know, what do you think?

ISTJ,"Hi everyone, 

I doubt wether my friend is ISTJ or INTJ can you help me ?

He is very pramatic, logical, organized, careful with money. He work in the financial field. He has a hard time with his emotions, he doesn't like to talk about what he feels but he knows how to say kind words. I think his love language is primarily Touch, this is how he express affection most of the time. And he dress very sharply, he has a great sense of style. I don't know if he is introverted or extroverted. He is a bit shy sometimes, likes to stay at home, but can also talk very freely with people he doesn't barely know. 

He admires my creativity, and my intelligence. He seems drawn to my feeling side even if he doesn't understand everything about it. He even understand and likes my humor?? I think he is one of the few who know I can actually be as sweet as tough given times. 

There is sometihng very balanced about our relationship that doesn't look like with what I've read about the INFP/ISTJ dynamic.

Do you have an idea ? Thank you :)

ISTJ,"Hi guys. This is my first post here. I learned that I am ISTJ only recently, but reading about this type of personality helped me connect the dots and realize that it fits like a glove.

I work as a junior graphic designer at a branding firm in Poland. On a daily routine I am asked to create websites, concepts, and creative copy from a scratch. It is very difficult for me as I am a perfectionist who suffers form impostor syndrome. Long story short, I am never satisfied with my work and I am having doubts if I picked the right path of career.

I am creative when it comes to ideas, but as far as graphic design is concerned, I find it demotivating to see so many better designers out there. They make me feel like my work is worthless. My co-workers have high expectations of me and demand creativity that I do not have, I am afraid.

So here's my question: are there any designers among you? How do ISTJ cope with creative tasks? If not design, would you choose a different career path? I was thinking about UX design (less visual design, more conceptualization) or QA testing (which requires programming skills that I do not have).

ISTJ,"This is a similar topic I posted in INTP because I thought I was an INTP but I took several cognitive function tests on different websites and got the same result: ISTJ. So, I will post this question to my fellow ISTJs out there that are hopefully in these careers (first-hand perspective) or know other ISTJs who are currently in these careers (second-hand perspective).  

Hi I have been confused about the myer Briggs personality test in the past and have read a book on the subject as well as visiting several websites and have switched from intj to intp to intf and finally I believe I am istj. My reason for believing this is that I have quickly realized after reading on many topics in this subeddit based on others topics and the way they react in their personal situations dealing with other people, their thoughts in public/private situations, their description of their behavior in public/private situations, their hobbies/personal interests, and even their view on life.. that I definitely am close to an istp for most of my daily life (mostly with my family and by myself..and then the F comes in when I work at my retail pharmacy technician job or my other retail job which involves a lot of customer interaction and listening as well as showing as much emotion that I can convey to the best of my ability.. which drains my energy). I am currently a graduate with BA in biology under my belt and would like to pursue another degree (preferably a masters for better job market opportunities in the greater Detroit area where I live). I am considering the following options and would like a short timeline in terms of acquiring the degree, the required skills, and easy availability of job since I am focused on making more money; however, I'd like to enjoy the job somewhat. These are the careers I am considering based on reading and interacting with professors in these fields and reading in this subreddit (a lot of software developers/ comp sci majors on here):

software development/software architect


Finance (my hobby involves creating a money management system along with a wagering system for the pick 3 lottery using software that generates lists of numbers and finding the best ROI for short term and long term goals of a gaining the best investment for my money.. I play on pen and paper and it's interesting to analyze and test different systems.. a career similar to this would be awesome.. I figured finance or investment management would be close to this).


Industrial engineering


Global supply chain/logistics
Nursing (because of high availability of jobs although I'm not very social but I have experience as a pharmacy technician in catering to patients needs somewhat.. although most of what I do is refill prescriptions and take care of rebill issues with a somewhat friendly demeanor within the pressure of retail get-it-done fast and move onto the next patient queuing system that retail pharmacy is based on..)


Respiratory therapy (found this in This subreddit looked interesting the jobs in Michigan aren't too high though but I'd still pursue it if possible and it's a short timeline to obtaining the degree, need to read more on this career)
Computer science in general (until I find a specialization)


Data scientist (the university i graduate from - wayne state - is releasing a new program that is roughly 3 years long that involves the engineering and systems engineering department, business school department, and computer science department into a masters of data science degree.. problem is that it requires GRE and my comfort on taking those kind of tests is at an all time low but I'd probably be willing to study for it if I find the right resources to study from and prepare for it efficiently). This program interests me because of the data analysis and tests as well as machine learning and artificial intelligence/neural networking used in analyzing data which relates back to my hobby of analyzing pick 3 lottery data for my test and backtesting systems to establish wagering and bankroll management systems in order to recieve highest ROI.. something that really interests me like a game or puzzle I need to solve.. and can make money from with proper discipline and established rules for my personal betting style.. This degree flips that investment management into quantitatively analytical view that I'd enjoy to gain as a skill for my own personal enjoyment).

So those are my options at the moment

ISTJ,"I'm an ENFP, so having an ISTJ father is kinda hard in the sense that I can't really tell what he's thinking. I feel like it's hard to bond with him at times and I'm not sure if he even cares that much. Sometimes his actions will say that he really cares, like a lot. Other times, it seems like he doesn't give a living crap about me. I mean, he's my dad so he has to care at least a little bit but just how withdrawn he is a lot of the time makes me question things. Plus it always seems like his expectations are unreachable. For example, the first time I took the ACT, he said a 30 should be my goal, which I thought was insane to begin with. I ended up with a 32 with a perfect score on the science section. A month later, he said that it would be nice if I could get a 33. I took it again and got a 34. Now he's saying it would be nice if I could get a 35. Like, um sir I am well above a 30 which was the *original* goal are you friggin kidding me?

ISTJ,"Hello! I've come to the conclusion that one of my best Friends is an ISTJ, although nothing I say can convince them that they are not INTJ. This person has done zero research on the functions, and it doesn't help that everything online depicts ISTJs as boring rule-followers(no offense; I love you guys &lt;3) which doesn't match them at all. I don't want to force them to look at the functions and do research, even though I know that it would be the most effective way to convince them; they have a tendency to resist MBTI in general because they believe it interferes with individuality. ""I understand why you want to have I type, but I just *can't*, ok?"" I didn't push it. However, lately they are seemingly more open to the idea of MBTI, but utterly convinced they are INTJ(again, they haven't looked at functions when I have). In my opinion, it doesn't matter what they think, but I'm just wondering if it's *healthy* for an ISTJ to latch onto something like I'm seeing them do. Is it common for you to stick with an idea like this? Is it normal for my Friend to reject MBTI, or is this something more personal? Do you have any idea why they originally disliked it but are now open only to the idea of being INTJ?

ISTJ,"Hi Reddit!  My name is SecuritySix, and I‚Äôm an ISTJ.

First of all, I‚Äôd like to apologize, because I know this is going to get long.

I am looking for some advice on how to gain and/or improve a particular subset of social skills.

Social skills are one of my biggest weak points.  And yes, I refer to human interaction as skill, because for me, and I suspect for a great many other Introverts, social interaction is not an innate talent, but something that has to be practiced and worked at.

My general social skills are‚Ä¶let‚Äôs go with ‚Äúfine.‚Äù  I can interact with other people just fine in everyday social situations.  Dealing with friends, coworkers, cashiers, family, and other people one encounters in a normal day, while draining, isn‚Äôt difficult from a technical standpoint.

The problem I run into presents when I am dealing with the opposite sex, and even then, only when I contemplate trying something beyond an everyday interaction.  If I‚Äôm speaking with a female relative or a friend‚Äôs wife, I‚Äôm fine.  Interacting with a waitress or a female cashier generally goes smoothly as well, since I can process it as a simple business transaction.

That said, when it comes to dating, I‚Äôm hopelessly helpless.  I can identify at least some of the problems standing in my way.  The trouble is, I don‚Äôt know what to do about them.  I have tried searching for ISTJ dating advice, but everything that comes up is how to date an ISTJ rather than how to date *AS* an ISTJ.  So, that‚Äôs where I‚Äôm hoping /r/ISTJ can help me out.  So, here‚Äôs a numbered list of problems of which I am aware.

1)	I am oblivious.  More specifically, I am intellectually aware of the signals a woman uses to indicate interest in a male, and I can even recognize those signals when I observe them being done to someone else; however, if/when they are done to me, I have no clue.  Unless a friend is there to witness it and say ‚ÄúDude, she was totally flirting with you,‚Äù I won‚Äôt know it happened.  And when my friends wait until a week after the fact to tell me, it‚Äôs too late to do anything about it anyway.

2)	Generally speaking, I am not an initiator/instigator, even among my friends.  I don‚Äôt throw parties, I don‚Äôt have company at my house, I don‚Äôt say ‚ÄúHey, let‚Äôs go out to eat.‚Äù  If someone asks, I‚Äôll jump in with an answer, if someone sets me up for it, I‚Äôll make a smartass comment.  To quote Deadpool, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt take the shits, I just disturb them.‚Äù 

3)	The thought of asking a woman out terrifies me.  I‚Äôve figured out that this isn‚Äôt actually a fear of rejection, odd as that may sound.  I‚Äôve been rejected enough times that it is familiar territory, so I know how to deal with it (I am sick of hearing ‚ÄúAw, that‚Äôs sweet, but I have a boyfriend‚Äù in all its variations).  I think the fear stems from 2 things:

a.	Analysis Paralysis.  How do I ask her out?  If she says ‚Äúyes‚Äù, where do I take her?  What will we talk about?  Etc.

b.	Fear of change.  I don‚Äôt like change, straight up.  I know change is inevitable, but I‚Äôm not good with it.  I don‚Äôt have a storage unit full of everything I‚Äôve ever owned or anything weird like that, but I‚Äôm slow to throw things away (I might find a use for that someday), I stay at jobs I hate for too long, schedule disruptions bug the crap out of me, stuff like that.  I‚Äôve been single for a very long time (I‚Äôm 34 and can count the number of girlfriends I‚Äôve had on one hand and have an embarrassing number of fingers left over).  Dating is change, and change is scary.

c.	Fear of acceptance.  This is sort of a combination of A and B, I think, but I acknowledge it as a specific thing.  If I ask a woman out and she says ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I figure the odds are pretty good that I will either stand there frozen like a deer in the headlights, or I‚Äôll run away screaming.  If I‚Äôm very lucky and can find one of my wits, I might say something stupid like ‚ÄúCrap, I didn‚Äôt expect to get this far.  Now what?‚Äù

4)	Kind of in line with #3, it takes me months of exposure to a woman for me to ask her out.  Call it ‚Äúworking up the courage‚Äù, call it ‚Äústrategizing the best approach‚Äù, call it ‚Äúbeing a coward for several months‚Äù, whatever.  It‚Äôs extremely rare for me to have regular enough exposure to the same woman to find myself comfortable enough to ask her out.  And ‚Äúcomfortable enough‚Äù isn‚Äôt really the right phrase.  It‚Äôs more like ‚Äúnot so unbearably uncomfortable with the notion that I just refuse to do it.‚Äù

5)	I‚Äôm actually OK with the other party initiating the whole dating thing (assuming I even know that‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening at some point), but that requires that I be somewhere that the other party *can* initiate, if that‚Äôs even going to happen.  Problem is, I‚Äôm a bit of a hermit.  If it weren‚Äôt for bowling once a week (which a friend basically goaded me into, although now that it‚Äôs part of my routine, I enjoy it) and regularly scheduled hangouts with my friends (every Friday and Saturday), I wouldn‚Äôt go anywhere but work and home on a daily basis with trips to the bank and grocery store every 2 weeks and the occasional stop for gas.

6)	Online dating doesn‚Äôt work for me.  I‚Äôm not saying it *can‚Äôt*, but see #2 for starters.  I‚Äôve had an OKCupid profile for more than 10 years, and while I‚Äôve messaged a few people, I‚Äôve put somewhere between zero and a negative number worth of effort into actually getting a date that way.

So, as you can see, I have plenty of the ‚Äúwhat‚Äù I need to work on.  I have no idea on ‚Äúhow‚Äù or ‚Äúwhere‚Äù to start.

Any help/suggestions would be appreciated.

TL;DR: I‚Äôm an ISTJ who may need an actual written instruction manual with step by step instructions on how to talk to women. 

If you read all of that, thank you very much for your time.  If you skipped straight to the TL;DR, insert some sort of insult that is an affront to your sensibilities right &lt;here&gt;.

It really, really annoys me when I'm confiding to someone about my feelings (rare, I know but it happens) and people just go like ""well yeah the same thing happened to me before blah blah blah"" and it sways the whole direction of the conversation to themselves. 

I'm not being self-centered here; I just think it happens to many of the people around me and it can get pretty depressing at times. Explains why I keep these conversations in my head most of the time. I read up about it like any ISTJ, and it's just behaviour for people to bring up their own experiences to try and relate to others so I'm not really sure if my peeve is justified here. Perhaps they could be just trying really hard.

What I wonder is, does it take a lot of effort to follow the emotions and try to analyse the causes and possible solutions for the one confiding without bringing up a relative experience you had?

Fellow ISTJ here, going to finish a degree in Software Engineering sooner than later.

ISTJ,"Hi Everyone,

INFP here, in a long-term, very committed relationship with an ISTJ (who is on the verge of ESTJ). Lately, we have been having a lot of fights over small things that blow up into days-long affairs. 

I love him for many reasons: his unwavering support of my at-times unstable career, the way he laughs at all my jokes, his social-minded activism and his utter devotion to me, which started day 1. 

However, there are things that feel insurmountable at times. We fight about stupid things, like how one should load a dishwasher. (I don't particularly care how people load a dishwasher, as long as it's done in a way that fits everything in, but he has a very specific way to do it. He interprets my lack of concern as disrespect, I think.) These small things turn into big things, and the way that we argue is not effective. I always feel he is trying to ""win"" and he feels I am unreasonable. He is very stubborn (as, perhaps, am I), and I think my emotions scare him. 

I have tried to explain to him that there are many different ways for people to live -- that there is never one right and perfect way to approach a task or idea, and that while he may believe that his way is the most efficient way to do something, not everyone values efficiency above all else. He cannot comprehend this. Am I crazy for trying to explain that/believing that? Does that sound crazy to other ISTJs out there?

I feel very alone in our relationship sometimes. Perhaps worth noting is that we live very far away from my family, all of whom are ENxx, for his job. I have a few N friends here, but I really value being able to connect deeply with my partner. 

I think if we could better understand each other's approaches to life, he might understand that I'm not trying to ruin his life when I forget to close the cabinet drawers, and maybe I won't melt into a puddle of misunderstood emotion who feels like she's being controlled when he suggests I organize my closet. Can anyone point me to a book or resource that could help us understand each other? Any ISTJs have advice on how I can better understand him and vice versa? INFP/ISTJ success stories? 

PS -- this is my first Reddit post! I've also only recently gotten into MBTI. Apologies if I'm doing this all wrong. ",1485824886
ISTJ,"Hey guys,

I went to college in September and made new 'friends' at least pals. I decided to invite them to my birthday party at a local pub. Only one of four appeared. The rest three had an absolutely great excuse such as 'I forgot' and 'Okay but I'm already with another company, I will go there soon.' etc etc etc.. Actually it was a bit bad for me that none of my new 'friends' came, but after all, who cares... I enjoyed myself and had fun with another real friends. But! That one guy who actually came, had a round on him several times. It was a cheap place and I didn't mind, but basically I pay back those rounds because I don't like have a bad feeling about it. A week or two ago he messaged me to have a drink somewhere again. Alright, I said the place and the time up to you. If you figure out when and where, send me a message. (I didn't want to go to be honest..) He said it's okay, but within two weeks I didn't get any message from him. Today he invited me to his birthday party that be held on Saturday. And the place, which he chose is a very very expensive place to me. Not for him, because he is older than me and he has a job besides college. That's one of my problem and I think I will be alone with his older unknown friends. I don't want to go, but I promised to him when I was drunk that if he have birthday in the future, I will definitely go.

**TL;DR:** I have a pal, he went to my birthday party, treated me with some beer. He want me to go their birthday party but the place is expensive and I won't know any of his friends who will be there. I don't want to go and I don't want to be a jerk because I promised him when I was drunk some months ago.

What to do? I force myself to go, stay for about 2 hours and go home? Or not home.. have an excuse to go with other friends I promised to have a drink with those people as well? Holy moly...",1485810500

ISTJ,"I don't like to generalize in terms of MBTI, but I have always known my ISTJ partner to be relatively withdrawn in communication and not too over the top. 

Some necessary context: We have been together now for 6 months. Met through online dating. Have for the most part had a pretty smooth running relationship. There was one incident where their ex was being possessive (passive aggressive) and they continued to allow them to do so, and I basically told them I wasn't going to compete and was fully prepared to walk. That was resolved. Aside from that, there have literally been no issues. I am an ENFJ, independent, have a lucrative job, financially stable, and all the things my ISTJ has said they admire. They are 29 and I am 28, we are both in our careers and established.

Lately, I've noticed a change in behaviour. Really in the last month or two. Some might welcome this. I won't lie, other ISTJ friends took around a year to get to open up. This is ... unprecedented and a bit in excess. Part of me wonders, how much of this is kissing my ass because my partner is afraid of me leaving them. Which I haven't had any intention to do, save for the drama they brought into my life with their ex. Which I assume is over. 

My ISTJ told me in November that they loved me. To which I said, ""That is so incredibly sweet of you...I really like you."", so I didn't return the weight of the sentiment they confessed. Because I thought it was too early (4 months in?).

Lately there has been a crazy amount of ""You're amazing."", ""You're so attractive."", ""You're cute!"", and other praises ... while they've not gone unnoticed and are appreciated, I wonder why this is suddenly coming out.

What is even happening? I've never known an ISTJ to behave this way. Is it a love bug that I'm overlooking and possibly not catching the hints on? Despite being Fe, I almost feel like they feel guilty for something ... and it almost doesn't feel genuine. :\

ISTJ,"Hello,

So, I am an INFP (male if that makes a difference) that has been romantically interested in an ISTJ female for the last few months. Recently, she has become single after leaving a nearly ten year relationship. She lived with him so I have been allowing to stay at my place when she needs to. 

It has been about three weeks and, as I have learned, she was interested in me too, even before the relationship was over (something I pretty much knew but couldn't exactly confirm). As of recently, when she is over, she is very intimate with me. We have already had sex, held hands, been sort of ""couple-like"", etc.

ISTJ,"Alright, this is kind of a hard question, with a lot of detail, so I'll include a TL;DR at the end.

So, I'm a 26 year old 37/40 ISTJ, and I have a LOT of trouble making new friends.  I have never really had many friends in particular, mostly work colleagues, but since I started my job on third shift (10pm-7am), I have struck out on all avenues of trying to make new friends.  I don't really have the option of making work colleagues friends anymore, because I work alone, in a sealed and locked office, without other human interaction.

Now, I do have a girlfriend, and I love her very much, but she works a different shift from me, and we don't get a lot of together and conversation time (additionally, she is an ESFP, so she doesn't really seem to relate in any way to the ""no friends"" issue).  I have tried Craigslist ads, meetups, even dating sites, trying to find others within reasonable driving distance that I can have a basic conversation with during my awake time.  The few times that I have gotten bites for conversations, they always seem to peter out, because I cant seem to ever find common interests to talk about, and the basic question and answer conversation dies out.  My girlfriend always says ""you don't like anything"", and I cant really fault that, because when I run into a text box asking about my interests, I end up freezing up, because, other than working, sleeping, and occasional single player video games, I cant find anything that I'm interested in either.  I don't drink, I don't smoke narcotics, I don't really do anything to have a conversation about at night.

I know, based on people's posts on here in the past, that a lot of you seem to be very much like me in personality.  So, what you all of you do to help find friends, especially those of you that don't get daily offline interaction via work or social activities?

Anyways, I was wondering if this might be a good way of distinguishing them: how good are you at recognizing movements in the environment, I.e. Not usually seeing an centipede in a sink and then suddenly seeing it when it moves; OR maybe something like: recognizing when someone walks in a room even if your head is down.

I've been working in advertising for the past 11 years, and after 6 years in media planning at an agency and another 5 years in client services on the sales / publisher side of the business, I no longer am interested in the industry and could honestly care less if a campaign has a strong results or not. It's all just blah for me at this point.

I'm VERY ISTJ and prefer to work alone once I have an understanding of the role / work that I'm doing. Below are a list of my skills and curious what others think would be a good transition in or outside of advertising:

*Very organized and efficient (i'm overseeing 3x the amount of sales accounts I should be but finish my work so early they've given me more to fill my days)

*High attention to detail

*Enjoy project management (cracking the whip on people to ensure everyone is doing their part to meet deadlines)
Really great in excel with budgets (i also have a big interest on where a company is receiving there money and how they're spending it - accounting future??)

I love what I do (consumer product development), but am worried about losing my job, especially since my company announced layoffs.  How do I ""fix"" things with him?

And I wasn't able to see her on her birthday yesterday because I am with my family some of which I only see at Christmas. She also lives in another city. And now she has been mad at me/depressed for the pass 3 days. I have tried to get her to talk about it because I know that tends to help but she wont.

ISTJ,"Any one else a 1w9 ISTJ?

When I read about this type it really rings true with me.  Objective, not natural to consider emotion, detached, value autonomy.  I personally like theory and think about big picture things and always thought I was different than the typical ISTJ description in this way.  I also find myself not compliant with rules if I don't see their value.  If they can be bent or broken without much consequence I will break the rules to achieve the best outcome.  However, if there is a large consequence I will follow the rules regardless because I never want to put myself in a spot I cannot maneuver out of.

An example of objective thinking:  the major company that I work for will make a decision to change some policy.  Everyone looks subjectively about the decision and how it impacts them negatively.  I most always take the side of the company because more often than not it is the correct &amp; logical decision. 

One time a co-worker of mine jokingly mentioned that everyone looks up in the sky and sees that it is blue but I will think its yellow.  Weirdly I take that as a compliment because I tend to believe that I think correctly.  But I'm not sure that I actually think correctly or its just my personality to think I'm thinking correctly.

One With a 9 Wing Description I found:

Ones with this wing can have an aura of 9-like calm although eruptions of temper are possible. Often have a detached quality and can be mistaken for Fives. Tendency to formulate and embrace principles that have little human content, but this is also their strength. When awakened, may be objective and balanced, cool and moderate in their evaluations. More entranced, might have perfectionistic expectations that are not humanly possible to meet. May hold social or political opinions that are supremely logical but ultimately heartless and draconian. The rules come first no matter what. Can be merciless or unwittingly cruel. Often a little colorless in their personal appearance. Many Ones with this wing are plain dressers, preferring functional clothing that is appropriate to context but not flashy. The emphasis on function may extend to their general lifestyle. Practicality is highly valued.",1482284835

-I often use past experiences to figure out what I should do

-I prefer to use lists rather than improvisation, though the lists act as reference

-I'm not a creative person. More often than not, I need outside inspiration

-Many rules in my life are for reference. I only follow them when they are convenient for me.

-I tend to draw connections with many entities

-I tend to daydream. I'm often in my own world

-I'm forgetful, though I remember some of the most crucial things about myself and other people

-Playing devil's advocate is common for me. To me, most things are often in gray areas

-It's easy for me to read subtle social cues and body language. It's easy for me to know how someone is feeling when I talk to them, though that ability stops at romantic stuff

-I tend to look at things as a whole. I hate nitpicking things

-Experience: After I ordered something at a McD's drive-thru, everybody in my car (coincidentally, they're sensors) noticed a woman crying while talking to her bf at the parking lot and I was only focusing on thought of the filet-o-fish burgers that I ordered for everyone.",1482084088

INTJ's mom though we can do small talk, but beyond that it always ends bad. 
   They are devout Christians, but she takes it to a whole other level. My husband and I respect all religions, and especially in their house we do things their way. She is very passive aggressive with her remarks towards others, and she trys to get me to play along. I will NOT play her reindeer games at all.

You guys, this is at church! I as an ENFP want to defend these people and educate her on a different perspective, and it truly breaks my soul to be around such negativity and judgement.

Background: I am a 35 year old INFP in a semi-long distance relationship of 1.5 years to a 38 year old always busy, always working ISTJ. We are 2.5 hrs away from each other.

I ostensibly have a good and stable relationship with my ISTJ boyfriend, but December is going to be a bit tough for me. 

--
1) He's moving from his current living situation to a new place alone so he's busy packing and won't have time to see me at all this month. I suggested coming down for a few hours and he was hesitant about that. 

--
2) I would help him pack/move as a good gf should, but he doesn't seem to think that's a possibility since he's not introduced me to his family or friends yet. We've talked about this before, and his reasons then were that his 90 year old grandmother who currently lives with him is bigoted/mean/suffering from the beginnings of dementia/OCD and would hate me (I'm not from his background). I'm sure I would get along with his hippie dad, but my ISTJ has not made any effort to have us meet yet either. Which kinda hurts since he's met my family over this past Thanksgiving. My 90 year old grandfather also has the beginnings of Alzheimer's/dementia but treated my bf with utter happiness (that I might get married finally).

--
3) We're not ""Facebook official"" but we are FB friends. Not sure if this means anything.

--
4) He calls me his girlfriend (but it took him awhile) and he says ""Love you"" ""Miss you"" sincerely I think. When we're together, he's very affectionate and loving. He's not sociopathic, I think he genuinely has a heart.

--
5) I was looking into a new job nearby to him so this distance wouldn't be such a pain, and he seemed fine with the idea of me moving closer to him. I forwarded him one ok-sounding job listing, and he said randomly: ""That new job is 50 minutes from my new place. 50 minutes is how long it takes for you to commute to your current job, isn't it? [from my current apt]"" so I think that means he was calculating that I could go to the possible new job from his place, maybe even living with him, or at least staying over on weeknights. So perhaps he's not actively trying to avoid integrating me into his life or hiding a double life.

--
6) With his living in his own place finally, he's said things will be different in 2017, meaning I'll finally be able to visit him at HIS place, and staying over, which I couldn't before, due to his grandma.

--
I just don't get why it's taking so long to introduce me to his family to the point where it's our 2nd Christmas, and we might not even spend it together because he's afraid of drama.

It's been a while since I have been paid, so I was only able to buy him a game we had both been looking at, he promptly bought one for me as well. He works more hours than I do, and does not spend money as freely, so he has more to throw around on days like these. To add to this, he absolutely loves buying me things. I do not like having people spend money on me, but I know it makes him happy so if I see something I like or something we both would enjoy I would pick it out. All in all, there was around 160$ spent on me collectively today, spread around in both of our interests (video games, sports, bath stuff for me) and I would like to put effort into repaying him, for lack of better word.

He's a stubborn man, he would not accept if I just pitched in and gave him the money back. My original plan was to take him up to the mall on another day and let him choose whatever he wants after I save up some paycheques, but seeing as he is as introverted as they come I am not sure if he would be 100% comfortable with it.

My other idea was to have him over and just set up a pampering day for him, his back aches quite a bit so he would get a nice massage, I would cook something for the two of us, he really likes pasta, and then we could relax and partake in whatever he chooses (most likely a nap)

ISTJ,"Hello fellow ISTJs,  

I am writing you with growing worries about one of yours. She is a long time friend, I met her 7 years ago.  
By the time, she was incredibly pretty, had all the cool guys at her feet, witty, smart, brilliant, ambitious, fun, full of life. Meeting her changed my life, she met a shy and insecure guy and gave him her trust. I eventually started to grow as a person, and she was the trigger.

But things changed. For 6 years now, I saw her fade away. The ambitions vanished, she stopped studying speech therapy, her dream job, after failing twice at the entry exam (said to be among the most difficult, but she was close to succeed and was hard-working toward her goal). Eventually, her father drove her to study something she didn't like so she'll have a job and won't just end as a cashier. Her dreams totally disappeared in the meantime.

Her very possible wish to live by the coast also disappeared and she settled in the middle of nowhere. She found a dull boyfriend who criticizes her job while being a builder worker.

The sporty and gorgeous petite redhead turned into a fat and lazy depressive woman. I don't recognize her. She is self destructing. And I don't know what to do to give her a hand and help her be happy. I try hard not to hurt her feelings, to show I care, to tell I want her to be happy. Our relationship has been chaotic these few years because while she was letting herself drown, I was going the opposite, and being a young ENTJ makes for arrogance and hurtful behaviors. I apologized countless times.  
But whatever, she becomes hysterical, says I am ridiculous, not honest, whatnot. I deeply feel she is very unhappy and frustrated, but way too proud to admit it to me, way too proud to open up, and then becomes almost agressive or ignores me.

What can I do? If she stays on the same line, she'll be buried before 40 (she's 25). I want to help her be happy again. Please, advise me.",1479991286

ISTJ,"Hi guys, I recently realized my boyfriend is most likely ISTJ even though he has his outgoing moments and can talk for longer than I can. He is, for the vast majority of the time, as loyal as can be -- he never gives me reason to distrust him. I know he loves me; he recently flew to meet my parents, and did his best to leave a good impression with them. He tells me I'm beautiful all the time; we adore each other.

However, he is an ISTJ, and I am an INFP, and we sometimes have moments where there is just silence -- him in his head, and me in mine. I don't think we mind it that much, but I get a little scared that he might find it understimulating (like what if he'd be happier with an Exxx?). Those fears come to a peak when we encounter an attractive person who is extroverted and naturally attention-drawing, and funny/witty like the waitress who was serving us the other day (she was an ESFP I think). Though he was wearing sunglasses and said nothing, I could tell he was riveted by her, and pretty much was slowly melting under her charms. I have no such charms and was struggling with jealousy but I never let him know how uneasy I felt. 

Though my ISTJ and I have chemistry and passion and mutually shared values, sometimes I notice he has a ""spark"" with other ES-types that I can't provide. How do I teach myself to be ok with that? As a perfectionist, I definitely struggle with not being ""the best"" for my partner.  ",1479742897

My leading female character is an ISTP and my leading male is an ISTJ. In the series they start out as 13 year olds, and they age several years as the series goes on. They have been best friends since they were 9, and since they are both quite isolated people they only hang out with each other (and they spend a large amount of their time together) unless they have a specific reason to be around others. These two are very close, and I want them to form a romantic relationship as the years go on.

So I have a few questions for you ISTJ's. Is this feasible? Do ISTP and ISTJ relationships, in general, work well? What are some unique interactions you have between the two personality types, some things that you specifically like or that bother you about ISTP's?

ISTJ,"I'm an INTJ who has unfortunately somehow fallen in love with an ISTJ. This has caused a host of great changes / brought out a completely different side of me, but that's besides the point.

I worked it up to confess (or rather, he kind of... got me to confess to him). He said it was requited, but that he didn't think that he could pursue a relationship yet and just remain close friends. I suppose this is due to his SJ nature coupled with the fact that we're both guys, even though he said he was bi (and that I basically confirmed that in him).

He's also incredibly dense. I consider myself oblivious, but he really is the definition of imperceptive (in the realm of interpersonal relationships at least... he's definitely much more perceptive than me in other things). Recently, I, being the weird INTJ I am, asked him for advice (on what I should do about a certain person), and he couldn't pick up that I was talking about him until I spelled it out.

Even though I was rejected (implicitly, I suppose), he hasn't really *changed* at all. I'm lucky enough to get him to agree to hugs, even though he's completely hug-averse (which I understand completely, because I usually really dislike hugs from anybody else), and he touches me / lets me touch him too when we hang out.

I just don't know how he could be perceiving the situation, and I'd like to try to figure it out, because otherwise, my mind will just keep on trying to figure it out. I text him often, but whenever he's busy, he usually just responds with ""shoo i'm busy"" or just ignores the message. I keep on trying to read into this as ""he secretly hates me but is too nice to tell it straight so he just avoids contact with me"". I can rationalize it as just him being busy, since we are both busy university students and he takes on very time-consuming extracurricular activities.

However, whenever it really matters, he comes through. I don't get much affection out of him, but every once in a while he says ""I love you"". When I ask for hugs, he usually reluctantly agrees and then makes fun of me for wanting one.

Now, I'm not going to ask how to win him over, but I'd like to get a glimpse what might be going on in his head or what he thinks of me.

**tl;dr:** I (male INTJ) confessed to a male ISTJ and was rejected. We're still close and he even tells me he loves me sometimes, but he ignores me via text often. What could he possibly be thinking?",1479408991

First off, I just wanted to thank everyone who commented, I expected lots of negative but I never got any at all and I appreciate that, thank you for sharing advice and experiences, it helped a lot!

So, he found the post. Not a bad thing, I think. Maybe I just wasn't communicating properly because since this things have become much better, even if he doesn't feel like giving me attention he will now kindly say why instead of just brushing it off, which makes it easier to understand with no feeling of neglect. 

I was really worried for a while, reddit. I thought we had lost all feeling, but now I know that we haven't. I've started feeling this thing that's never really happened before; my default for receiving things is to share with him. I'm an ENFP, I love gifts, I usually take them all to myself. But now, every time someone gives me something minor, like chocolate or a game, I immediately give some to him as well (not in front of who gave it to me, that seems sort of rude) and let him experience it too. I think it's nice, I've never felt it before. 

He's much more attentive now, I think he's starting to understand that sometimes I don't have a reason for being upset, so instead of getting frustrated and ignoring me he just asks if it's ""one of those days?"" to which I'll agree and then we have comfortable silence as I calm myself down. 

I miss him, reddit, we haven't had time to be alone together since August and that sometimes puts a strain on me, but now I feel like we can sit down and make plans together, instead of me asking over and over when I can see him. 

He initiates small contact much more now, which I adore, and he's more receptive to me reaching out to him as well. I know now that instead of waiting for him to take my hand, I should just reach over and ask to take his instead. 

We haven't had time to text when we aren't with each other, but it's easier to understand now, I barely even notice. It's not that we are ignoring each other, it's just so busy now.

Long story short, I love him more than I'll ever know, and he loves me too.",1478259772

When we played World of warcraft together for a long time he'd be the guy always going out of the way to make the guild better, constantly striving to support the community, keep conversations going, recruiting people, planning events, and so on.

My concern is he's gotten comfortable with just living a life of only gaming, and I want to help him do so much more with his life, because I know he's very capable, but he doesn't want to. If something isn't fun he doesn't want to do it. So he's not even willing to try new things, much less work on things for the betterment of his future. There are things he wants to do, but doesn't want to go through the effort to become, he likes to do things just enough until it's not really fun anymore.

Given these circumstances I'm baffled upon how to go about helping him, as he doesn't want help. He's even stated directly to me he's annoyed that I try to help him, and that ""if people don't want help you can't help them."" How can I motivate him or, idk something.. 

What can I do? I feel so helpless knowing he's devoting all of his time to things that won't help him in the future, when the real world hits him, He'll be stranded at a dead end job at this rate and be miserable, we've even discussed this and he says he's fine with that.

ISTJ,"Hey y'all I'll try to keep this quick with enough information to give a fair and balanced overview of the situation

So the title explains itself. I'm a junior in college and I'm interested in this freshman girl whose in my professional fraternity. We had some interesting back and forth, where we both kind said ""savage"" things to each other and faux insults, but all in good fun. I thought she was cute and in to me because she texted me all the time! So I went on two lunch dates with her and we talked at one of our fraternity parties for some time. But then things got complicated at our latest party last weekend. I was playing it cool, we had a good time, she started grinding on me pretty hard. Then I got hella drunk and I don't remember much of the rest of the evening save for these snippets. 

One, I asked her to come with me to Cookout the burger chain, I dont remember but I think she said no. I asked her to hang out with me the following day, she definitely said no. Then something something was said and then I remember ""We're friend. We're buddies"" or ""We're just buddies"" I don't recall but i'm not sure. I remember feeling rejected that evening and complaining about it so it may have been that. I don't really recall though. 

I was really embarassed the next day. But she texted me twice! Said I told her stuff. I asked her what. She just wrote ""hahaha"". 

Then I saw her at a chapter for our fraternity. It was awkward at first because I felt weird about the whole thing. But she wanted to play pool, eating dinner with me etc. Then after chapter she left and then came back and was waiting around. So I""m all like ""I thought you left"" and then she left with me. Followed me back to my place, past her place, like I mean she went out of her way to follow me. Then she gets weird, says ""bye"" awkwardly"" and shoves me and then runs away. 

I invited her to lunch two days later and she agreed and that was today. We talked nicely and laughed and had a good time. But she left after like 30 minutes because she had ""work to do"" and had to go to the ""chiropractor"". 

So I mean, the situation is pretty confusing and I hate to overthink. Of-course, I've received some of those ""vibes"" and also she always taking snapchats of me! Like literally during our lunch date she took three pictures of me! But I've been questioning the whole ""Friends"" comment at the party. Also, she said stuff like ""That's how I treat my friends"" and called me buddy twice during our lunch date. 

I don't know what this all means, but I'm wondering. Should I give up? I've heard ISTJ's are pretty direct with what they want and how they feel. So if she says we're just friends, should I take it at face value? Or is there something else going on? 

Should I pursue her? I definitely want to and I think taking my time would best suit my purposes. Playing this for the long haul. But if I've already been friend-zoned then what can you do? ",1476852271

He confuses me... and vice versa. 

Based on his reactions he doesn't seem to be bothered by my dark/morbid humor either. He appears rather fascinated by it and finds fictional characters such as Hannibal intriguing. He has a dry sense of humor and can be sarcastic which is a common denominator.

I'm surprised an ISTJ like him finds someone like me so interesting especially based on our differences . He likes how I can be adorable yet so dark. Mature but also know when to not be serious.

ISTJ,"Hi, my ISTJ older brother has been in a rocky marriage (and before that rocky relationship) for a few years now. I'll tell you their problems in brief - 

-they're very different people with low compatibility 
- she's clearly a narcissist and he's clearly a host in their dynamic (and he knows this) 
-every few months they keep trying to live together and make up, but inevitably they have a series of fights and she leaves 
- recently she got her father to threaten him ""or else"" (her dad's an ex cop) 
-he's aware of all the ways she's wrong for him (and generally not a very nice person) but he just can't seem to let go 

Context- We're Indians, and family and marriages are particularly sacred here. People do get divorced fairly commonly, but it's still slightly looked down upon. Him being an ISTJ is obviously all about the tradition. Though my parents don't care about traditions in this aspect and badly want them to get divorced and him to be happy. His wife's already got one divorce under her belt. And he feels very responsible and guilty towards her because of that and a few other things. He's in his mid 30s and she's in her late 30s. They don't have kids. 

My real question is this: he's finally about to serve her with divorce papers but keeps flip flopping on the whole thing all.the.time. This is very unlike him. And in the last 2-3 years I've seen him get increasingly more pathetic, needy, gullible, emotional, paranoid and stressed. 

This is NOT the super practical, seemingly detached, adventurous go getter I knew all my life. I really want to help him but don't know how. 

I'm an ENFP, so for me, getting out of a run means sorting through my feelings, going out with friends a lot, applying logic to a previously emotional situation and just moving the fuck on. 

My brother has a few good friends but doesn't meet them regularly. He only opens up to my parents. (Who just get further stressed. They have their own stuff to deal with so it makes me sad to see them all sucked in) 

What do I do? I'm planning to surprise him with a scuba diving open water course in Thailand, as a gift. He'd love the peace down there. Any and all suggestions welcome.

I don't easily get offended, and both us mutually enjoy having things proven off of concrete facts.

ISTJ,"Hello you ISTJ's here, 
an ENFP here worried about my ISTJ Friend who is having some self-esteem issues. This Friend is really precious to me, since shes always there to listen to my crazy blabla and emotional up and downs. I am really glad that she opens up to me aswell and lets me know when shes having a bad time. 

Thing right now is, that she feels stuck in her life and that she feels like not beeing enough. Things like men rejecting her or just not answering really hurt her deeply, questioning her all beeing. Dont get me wrong, she gets alot of attention from men. She is really beautiful and has style thats also where she gets her energy from. She has a clear idea of what feminity means and how a lady should behave. But yeah while its easy for her to get the attention of men, its hard to keep them interested, whereas she now worries about beeing an uninteresting person.

She also has a huuuuge problem with opening up to others (except me and her mom) especially when it comes to romantic matters. Like, she broke up with her ex 2 years ago, but still regrets that one love letter she sent him while they were in a relationship. She still thinks about it and feels reaaally embarassed by doing so. And me ENFP just dont get it. I have no idea how she can be so embarassed about real feelings she felt at a time. How she can be so deeply upset when cute strangers dont text her back and how it really ruins her day. Like, when i get rejected, i just think that its probably not meant to be and that i rock either way and that its his loss not mine. But everytime i tell my istj friend my viewpoint, she admires me, but cannot really apply this thinking for herself.

 So yeah we came to the conclusion that she doesnt really love herself enough to feel that way. I bombarded her with lots of self-love quotes after that and she thankfully takes in everything i tell her, but i dont know if the methods i use to feel that way also work on her.

So yeah, thats why i was wondering how other ISTJ's feel concerning that self-esteem issue. How did you overcome the lack of self-love and what could i tell her to make her realize that shes worth so much more than she thinks.",1474391028

ISTJ,"I have seen quite a few 'help my ISTJ!' things on here, because I thought I'd have a read of some of your responses to existing posts. I like the way you guys write; it has a crispness to it that I'm not used to.

Getting to the point, I have an ISTJ friend at work who was in a relationship with another colleague who is definitely on the loud end of ESFP. I've been on both sides of the relationship before, during and after they were together. I was wing-man to both of them before it started and then counselled them during and after. Bizarre. 

Anyway, they are deliberating over whether they should get back together or not. I can see that both of them are thinking about it in a more than speculative way. Common gripes seem to be about communication; I believe both of them are bad at verbalising their feelings - evidently, because they are telling me how they feel instead of each other.

I was wondering if any of you experienced ISTJ/ESFP relationships before. On the surface, the match-up is bloody awful, but they were together for quite a long time and clearly care for each other deeply. I believe that they could learn a lot from one another, but perhaps they are too strong-headed. I'm fairly certain the ISTJ wanted to marry the ESFP. We talk about MBTI a lot at work and frequently the ISTJ takes the theories home to read. I think I'm seen as a reliable source of information because I've predicted and correctly analysed the ESFP's behaviour patterns.

I've deliberately left the genders out!",1473398418

ISTJ,"They gave me a car for graduation. 
Okay? Cool. 

I had to buy a new tire and whatever,  but the car is good. 

Then one day,  my mom said ""It'll cost us $1,000 to get our tags on our new car renewed. We're going to borrow your plates til then. Just get a new bill of sale each month and you'll be fine.""

Me being a naive, my parents would do me no wrong, 18 year old,  I was okay with it. 

I got pulled over last night and now I have a ticket. 

My parents are acting like it's my fault just because I didn't get a new bill of sale. But I should have never been in that situation to begin with. 

But the bill of sale situation is fucked anyways. 

They want me to get one, say that I bought the car on the first of this month and forge my mom's signature. 

That's a federal document if I'm not mistaken and that's 5 years in prison and a $10,000 fine.

ISTJ,"Hi, I'd like some advice on what to do in my situation...

It is a very VERY complicated situation...I'll try to summarize it as best I can and answer comments/questions with anything I might've left out.

We'll call him Tom. Tom is 25, Taurus, ISTJ. Tom has had one hell of a year thus far. He was with his ex for 1.5 years, engaged as well. They were trying to have a baby towards the end of their relationship, she ended up breaking up with him mid-April. Beginning of May, she informed him she was pregnant. He was so happy. She never gave him a single bit of proof that the baby ever existed. She wouldn't let him go to the ultrasounds, wouldn't give him pics of the ultrasounds, wouldn't meet him for coffee or nothing. Beginning of June, she had the 8 week ultrasound (June 8th) and said the baby had no heartbeat. Miscarriage supposedly. Still no proof it ever existed either. I met Tom mid-May, we met on Tinder. Tom has always been honest with me from the beginning. He was not looking for a relationship, he honestly just got on Tinder to match with as many chicks as he could to have lots of sex...he was hurting. He told me, ""I never expected to find someone as awesome as you on Tinder."" He cancelled his Tinder subscription as well. (The one for 100 likes a day or something?) He'd always tell me things like I deserve a guy like him and he's a ""cookie cutter"" example of what I need, etc. Anyways, Tom had recently moved to my area with his friend/boss (never a good idea to live with your boss.) He ended up quitting/getting fire from his job mid-June (he gave his boss an ultimatum, give him the money he owes him or fire him. He fired him.) Due to his roommate being his boss...he moved back to his old apartment he was still paying rent on and had a another month left in the lease. Before moving, he asked me my thoughts on him moving back to the old apartment since it is an hour away and he was not sure if I'd be okay with it. I told him we'd manage and for him to do what he needed to do. So we moved him back there. His vehicle also broke down around this time and I lent him my spare car for the month it took him to fix his.

Tom and I hung out solid for 2.5 months. We practically lived with each other. In the 73 days we were seeing each other, we only spent 14 days apart mostly due to my dad flying into town every couple weeks and a 4 day gap during our initial meeting. He introduced me to his grandparents and I introduced him to my dad and friends. Every night we were together we would cook hour long meals from scratch together, watch tv together, play video games together, go to sleep and cuddle together (we rarely had sex, maybe once every two weeks if that), I'd wake up and make him coffee in the morning and we'd figure out what we wanted to do for breakfast and chill and watch tv together before I headed to work. We watched a lot of Dragon Ball Z and Dragon Ball Super, it was great! Not going to lie though, we did have our issues. June 6th was a big one when we talked about his future baby and that we needed to stop having sex and kissing but we'd still be friends. At that time, he really fought to keep me in his life because I wasn't sure I could handle it. I knew my emotions were already strong for him. June 8th, things changed when the baby had no heartbeat. We were a team that complimented each other. We would talk and work things out whenever we could. He did tell me though that he wasn't and isn't ready for an official relationship. We were however, exclusive with each other. He's the one that brought that up. At the end of July, we moved him into his grandparents house because he still had no job and didn't want to re-new his lease at his old apartment. Before deciding...he once again asked me my thoughts on him moving into his grandparents. I told him same thing again, do what you need to do and we'll manage.

Getting to when the current issues arised. When he found out about the baby, he was also dealing with an issue in the military. He'd been in the military for 4 years and had been out since January '16. He had to go in front of a board June 5th and ended up getting back into the military for another year. He wanted to do this to get insurance and benefits and such for the baby. July 30th, he left for the military Annual Training. He kept in contact well for a couple days, messaging me every night. Then missions started and his texting became less and less. Which was fine, I knew he'd be busy. I told him to text me whenever, night or day, didn't matter. Not to worry about waking me up or bothering me at all. I'm pretty flexible. He got back August 20th, didn't message me so I finally messaged him at 7pm

Me: How are you was doing
Him: Good to be home
Me: Glad to hear it

I was a bit hurt and mad that he didn't immediately let me know he was home. But I let it go.

Me: Any plans tonight?
Him: Yep dinner with my brother at his house.
Me: Sounds nice, better than MREs ;) Hit me up later if you like. It'd be nice to talk with you, but I don't want to be a bother when you've just come back and are being with family. 

Next day, I sent him a text on my way to work, 
Me: I hope you are doing well. Have a great day. 
Him: Doing well, what are you doing
Me: Driving to work.

We did some basic chit/chat that didn't feel too natural. He just seemed terse/aggressive moreso than normal. I tried to let it go but also wanted him to meet my mom while she was in town for the week. 

Me ""Idk where we're at currently or how you're feeling on things...kinda wanted you to meet my mom while she's in town...but Idk either."" My mom has been away for 7 months doing chemotherapy, she was only able to come home for 2 weeks before having to go back for surgery. He was only home during her final week. It was kinda a big deal to me.

Him: ""Yeah I feel what you're saying and we can talk about all of that. I mean in my mind nothing should have changed. I'd rather be simple than make things complicated. I want to figure out my living situation and career. And that is what takes up most of my mind. These last three weeks I worked really hard and reaped some rewards. I know you've been working hard too. But let's chill on the upgraded thoughts about bf gf stuff.""

Me: Could we meet up over the next few days and talk/walk?
Him: sure. 

That was always our way of 'serious' type of communication. Walking and talking. Walking is a very positive, forward moving experience and helps to get things out easier. We would always walk and talk. I left it at that...for 4 days...no contact...Then contacted him asking how the hunt for work was going. He said hunting atm. 

This is getting a lot longer than I thought it would but trying to be thorough.

Anyways, it was at this point I decided to try to figure things out a bit more. It felt like he was hiding something. INFJs follow their feelings a lot. 
Me: I get the feeling that I should just mail you your stuff back. (I had his ps4 while he was at Annual Training to play Doom and Fallout 4) 
Him: I would like my ps4 back at some point.
Me: I know you'd like your ps4 back, wouldn't keep it from you, that's why I suggested mailing it instead. I feel bad still having it. (Given he's been back for 6 days.)
Him: It's not a huge deal I'm just under motivated to get it atm. I've been working other things. You could mail it if that's easier. Idc
Me: Well, my parents fly out tomorrow and I got Saturday off still. I don't know what your plans look like...
Me: Ultimately, I don't know if you want to see me again.
Me: I'll wait until you're ready to talk. Have a goodnight.

The next day, he contacted me, asking if I wanted to come over after work. I said sure. I went over there and things were a bit awkward...caught up on our 3 weeks apart, talked about the pinworm story all over the news in Atterbury, Fort Knox, and MUTC, he played Doom on his ps4 I returned and I watched. We went to bed, he didn't move to cuddle at all. Hour or so later, I woke up to him jerking it in a half sleep state, took over for him, finished him ;) I know he likely hadn't gotten any good release in awhile. After a bit, he was still a rock, so I mounted up hoping that might get /something/ out of him, nope...dead fish...no fun so I just rolled over and tried to sleep. Next morning, I stayed in bed. He got up, played video games for a few hours, went outside and smoked with his grandad and I showered up. Then he came in, showered up, changed clothes, gave his grandma a hug and me a hug saying he was heading into town to get his phone fixed (data issues) and get some contacts. I walked out to his car with him

(this convo is based off memory, so don't quote these exactly unless it has quotes)

Me: Want to come over to my place tonight?
Him: No, I really need to get things taken care of here. I don't know what I'm doing.
*he paused and played with his keys, not looking at me*
Him: I don't want a relationship right now. I have nothing to offer you, I literally have nothing going in my life. I have nothing to my name. I can't promise anything down the road. I don't even see a road.
Me: It's not about what you have to offer...*sighs* 
Him: ""We should end this before we fuck each other up...""
Me: ""Can you clarify that?""
Him: ""I've already fucked up my life...I have nothing...I have no idea what I'm doing..."" (I took this as, he's ruined his life and doesn't want to ruin mine)
After a bit of similar things being said, he continued asking me what I want from him, I told him I don't want anything from him. I even brought up last night and he said I was trying to sleep...at least you got yours...I told him, dude, you were jacking off next to me...he said he was probably scratching his balls...I'm like, you were moaning!! -_-
Also told him,
Me: I don't think I can just be friends at this point
Him: I don't want to be friends. I don't want any friends right now. I want to be alone. I went out drinking with my cousin the other night, saw a bunch of friends at the bar and I just didn't want to be there. I didn't want to be around anyone.
Him: I don't know what you want...
And that's when I shut the door on him and walked into his grandparents house, got my things and came back out, he was gone. I left.
I sent him texts on my way home. 3 texts over the course of my hour drive in an upset state.
Me: I'd been trying to help you, always have been. Wasn't trying to fix you. The condo is 2 bedrooms, even thought about offering the 2nd to you by splitting rent. It'd get you around Indy for jobs and get you out of your grandparents and no lease to sign so you could always leave whenever you wanted to. But I know how it'd sound if I even tired to bring it up. I've merely wanted to support you in whatever you're doing.
Me: I figured if we did stop, after the 3 weeks would be a good time to do so. Be happy you don't have feelings...so many times you did lead me on, stupid of me to love someone so quickly...coworkers and friends were right, in the end I'd get hurt...Idk why I bother hoping
Me: Made it home. I really hope your life gets better Tom. I'm sorry for everything you've been through thus far. If ever you do need a friend. i would gladly be there to help you. Keep in touch. Hit me up in a few months or whatever if you like.

This was on Saturday, August 27th...Tuesday the 30th, I mailed him his fav Dark Chocolate Brownies with a note saying Hope you are doing well!

I want to fix things with him...but I know he needs time...but I'm not even sure what to do. Anyone on here that knows INFJs know that we want to do anything in our power to help...but you can't help an ISTJ lol they typically just don't want it! I've never told him what to do and what not to do. I've always been there to give him support and reassurance. He's always valued me greatly and has told me such. I worry he is depressed, that being at the annual training gave him too much time to think. He doesn't know if he wants to get a job, he doesn't know if he wants to go back to school to finish his /last/ semester up for his degree, he doesn't know what he wants to do. He knows he wants to move out of his grandparents asap. I'm buying a condo...2 bedrooms...wouldn't mind if he became a roomie, but he'd read a LOT into that if I asked lol


TL;DR: Read it lol I seriously cut this down from 12 pages in Microsoft word to 5 pages. I can't think what else to cut! Everything seems relevant since everything happened in 3 months time rather quickly.

To me (INFJ) what he needs to do, is trust in me a bit. Work on planning what he wants to do, work on shopping around for jobs in the Indy area, save his money from military duty and wait until I get the condo in October, move in with me (no deposit, no lease, no paying 2 months in advance, etc), get a job in the area, and go from there. Give it a /try/ and see how it goes. If he's still not happy with where he is in a few months, move out. No lease, nothing to tie him down. BUT his trust has been broken...badly...he's been hurt. Rejected by the person he's loved the most and rejected by his unborn child that may or may not have existed. He's told me before that he doesn't want to get hurt again. Nor do I. Yet here we are.

I'm planning on calling him tomorrow...see if he'll come over to my place Saturday and we can cook dinner, watch more DBZ Super, and walk/talk. INFJ and ISTJ...talking about emotional shit...never goes very well.

People tell me to move on, people tell me to wait a few weeks or a month or two, my therapist says to follow what I feel I should do, I worry about him in this state, what do you guys feel I should do? I've talked to one other ISTJ so far, he said message him a few times a week, let him know you are still there and around, don't try to talk about you or us or we, etc. So I haven't.

I'm trying to undo the damage I did to myself by being so negative and uninterested in life. Basically, I need to learn how to interact with people again, so my college experience is not the same as my high school one. One benefit here is that I don't hate everyone, so there's that.

I ended up crying and he became increasingly frustrated that I wouldn't (in my words, couldn't) talk it through with him. He ended up saying that he feels that everything has to be ""on my terms"" and he's tired of me not talking about it with him and that I'm ""shutting him out"".

I can't figure out if I don't like troubleshooting or if it's more the customer stressing me out. I just want to be trained on how to do my job, assigned tasks and left to do them. I love the boring admin tasks like raising calls, updating worksheets, installing new software, creating users, etc. Anything I know how to do/have done previously and requires little customer interaction. 
I am not sure if I have something wrong with me, ie a learning disability of some sort, but it is weird how stressed out I get at work. It does not help that for the company I work for sucks, and the first couple of months they killed my confidence. They dropped my wage, they made fun of some of the mistakes I made on my calls and made me very uncomfortable asking for any help ever since. 
Now I have always worked in IT support in some form, but I have never had a passion for it like most my colleagues I come across. They genuinely like new tech and solving problems, where I couldn‚Äôt care less. 
I have a couple of options I want some help/guidance on. It‚Äôs worth noting that I have a mortgage and have about 5 months‚Äô worth of savings. Every minute I am there I am constantly thinking about quitting (and most of the time outside of work is spent thinking about quitting too). The thing is, I don‚Äôt dread going, nor does it affect my sleep. But when I wake up on a workday I am like FUCK. Then I get there and I get one call that stresses me out and I am caught in an anxious loop for the day. 
I really, REALLY want to hand my notice in and have a month or so off to figure out what I want to do with my life. The only reason I haven‚Äôt is due to the fear of future employers looking down on my giving up on a job. 
Or I can try another IT support job, I even have 2 interviews scheduled in the coming weeks but I am not bothered at all about going. They are both with huge organisations with great pay and benefits, but I do not want to go, there is no interest what so ever. Plus I have no holidays left so would need to call in sick, which I don‚Äôt like doing. I feel with my personality I am more suited to an accounting environment, but I don‚Äôt feel intelligent enough. My doctor has also advised he can sign me off sick for a while, I am a little tempted by this. The only thing stopping me is what my co-workers will think. 


To summarise the 3 options:


‚Ä¢	Hand in notice, have some time off to figure out what I want to do with my life.

‚Ä¢	Try another IT support job.

‚Ä¢	Go on sick for up to a month.


Any input would be greatly appreciated.

ISTJ,"I'm an INFP married to an ISTJ and tend to pop up on your thread occasionally, entirely uninvited, with my thoughts on ISTJ related relationship stuff.  So this is my latest thought, borne through our recent marriage developmental stage.  

Do your relationships peter out and and feel unfulfilling?  Are you struggling to hang onto them even if you really like the person?  I hear a lot of ISTJ's complaining about these things, and it may connected in part to this one thing.  Bear in mind I'm possibly over-generalising to all of you here, but hear me out :)

I think ISTJ's may have a natural low capacity for nurturing others.  And every human being thrives on nurture.  This may be the reason you guys seek out nurturing other halves, like us NFPs or NFJs for example. My husband has had to slowly learn nurturance and it's benefited our marriage enormously.  

I found the list of high nuturance vs low nurturance traits (on this page, http://sfhelp.org/gwc/4_grouptraits.htm scroll down to the box) a helpful way to assess if your relationship/family/group etc is healthy in terms of nurturing other members.

Apparently nurture is defined as: the action or process of nurturing someone or something.
""the nurture of children""
synonyms:	encouragement, promotion, fostering, development, cultivation, boosting, furtherance, advancement
""the nurture of ideas""

And it appears to me to involve not just co-existing alongside someone, but actively looking into their personality, studying what they need to grow or improve, and pushing them towards getting that need fulfilled, or providing for it yourself.  

I wonder if your guys natural sense of independance, and the fact you don't necessarily value/need high levels of nurturance yourself (not sure if I'm right here) might mean you don't see your other half as needing it, but any other type except other STs and possibly SF's would probably need this.

Anyway, my sincere apologies if this is useless or in any way hurtful, it's not intended to be, it's just something my husb has had to work on, and it's strengthened us enormously, and I figured there may be one or two other ISTJ's out there who could benefit from it too.

Much love to your addictively gorgeous dark silent selves haha!",1471756869

ISTJ,"Title says it all. She's sweet but gets too upset over things she thinks I'm willing to change about myself. I'm not. Mainly because I'm not willing to change anything about myself. A relationship to her is ""work"" and it isn't for me, it's fun and a distraction from work. Our 2 year anniversary is September 1st but I'm just not into her anymore. She's looking to be wifed up and have kids within the next year and I'm not looking to get hubbied up until I'm 30 with a good job. I guess I'm looking for advice on a good way to approach this. She's nice so I want to do it in the best way possible. Any additional information you need let me know.

ISTJ,"I tend to go through the test multiple times, maybe once every few months. Since the answers always slightly depend on mood, they tend to fluctuate a bit, giving me roughly 50/50 with ISTJ and INTJ.

ISTJ,"I am an ENFP, and my whole entire life I've always thought the one I love would be like me, loud and excited. But my love is so wonderful, we are literally as opposite as we can be but I find that so fascinating, that I can learn things and mannerisms from him that I'd never find with anyone else.

I understand ISTJs have trouble expressing their emotions, which sometimes brings out a little insecurity from me because I am constantly expressing my emotions. He's sometimes very reserved, but he always makes sure to appreciate what I do for him. He knows he loves me, he knows I love him, and that is all that matters, no matter how expressive he is. He isn't romantic in the slightest sense, but many months ago he gave me a bracelet and I have not taken it off since, and it's easy to tell he is proud.

He is also very well mannered and polite, albeit a little old fashioned, but that is one of the things I love so dearly. He opens doors, always helps my parents clean up after dinner, he always uses common curtesy, and he is extremely respectful to the people he cares about. 

He is so shy, so timid sometimes that I'll have to order food or do anything of that nature. But, whenever I am having moments where I do not want to interact with any person other than him, he will step up without hesitation and do the things that make him uncomfortable. Even though he doesn't use them much, he has excellent people skills, because he is a realist and can tell it like it is, and people like that about him. 

He is fiercely protective and extremely competitive. Some people may find these traits undesirable, but he knows my fears and how to protect me from them. When I am feeling insecure, he blocks out the world and allows me to focus on the two of us, which calms me quicker than anything even could. He loves winning, and whenever we okay sports together sometimes he gets a little heated because I simply have no care for competition, but the issue is always resolved.

The last thing I love about him (and ISTJs in general) is that he is so kind. Genuinely kind, he's the brand of nice that you may only come across once in your life, the kind that only wants others to be happy without worrying about himself or getting something in return. He will drop everything just to make sure I am alright, and he says the sweetest things when I am upset, never blowing it out of proportion or getting upset himself, which makes it easy for me to calm down. He's levelheaded and sweet, always grounding me and reminding me that what we have, what we are, is beautiful.

I never thought I'd love an ISTJ. But turns out in my opinion, ISTJs have the most beautiful minds and hearts, so thank you. ",1471607046

Hi all. I'm interested in seeing what correlations exist between certain types and various random things, so I've created a big survey. Its a little bit long, it will probably take 10-30 min depending how fast you are at filling out surveys. I tried to mix fun questions with serious questions and so topics include pop culture, politics, art, lifestyle, etc.

I also posted this in /r/mbti, but I'd like some more varied responses (INxx types really like filling out surveys) The survey is at [this link to google forms](https://goo.gl/forms/fHSemrg0ey1EYfK63)

It is completely anonymous, handled by google forms. After you take it it will let you see the raw results, please don't spoil these results for others. Once I have enough responses, I will perform a statistical analysis on the results and share them on /r/mbti.

If you know anyone else interested in MBTI, feel free to share the survey, but please only fill it out once yourself.

**Please don't spoil** the survey questions for others, particularly the trivia questions, I want to see what types have knowledge/interest of certain things.

Also, sometimes when he's mad instead of resolving an argument, especially if it's late at night, he'd rather just leave it be and not mention it in the morning. This annoys me so much because I hate just letting arguments go unsolved.

ISTJ,"ENTP girl here, I've posted in the INTJ sub before about an INTJ/ maybe ISTJ fellow that I've been pursuing for the better part of a year. To make a long story short, there's been very slow but steady progress since end of last year when we first expressed our feelings. Lots of hills and valleys; the hills are wonderful times we spend together and can't stop talking, a lot of making out, some cuddling and a sleepover here or there...and the valleys almost always occur when I get impatient or feel like he is ignoring me/my feelings and go cold on him and he doesn't understand what's going on. But we have gotten better over time, more hills than valleys in our slow and steady march up since late November last year.

Last night I called him and while we were chatting on the phone and I broached the question of ""so...what are we doing?"". Normally I would hate to ask that question and like to let things progress naturally, but it was pertaining to our conversation and he didn't seem upset or scared off. His response? A very hesitant but courageous (for him in my mind) ""Well, we're at least dating right? We're seeing each other? That's what I thought."" Pretty much left me grinning ear to ear, and I responded, ""That's what I was thinking. I'd like that if you would too."" He affirmed. He visited me over lunch today. Kissed me goodbye. He's heading on a guy's only road trip this weekend and I have a wedding, but asked if he could text/call me over the weekend.

So! I just was hoping you r/ISTJ could maybe give me an insight into how you personally would feel this far along. It seems like things have been developing super slowly, as this has been in the works since November...but it is undeniable progress. (Note: this is his first relationship ever, and I am essentially his first everything. Him 34M, me 26F) I'm pretty much crazy about him but have really done my best to not overwhelm him with too much stimulation, give him a lot of recharge time, and still try to express my interest with lots of texting, talking, kissing, and snuggling. :)

How serious is ""dating/seeing each other"" to an ISTJ? What does that really mean to your logical brain?

Am I crazy for thinking this is going well with the pace being so slow, or is this pretty on par?

Any advice on how to handle going forward and next moves?
Thanks to any responses I get! I also posted this to r/INTJ, because while I do think he is very strongly I, T, and J, I see a lot of N and S tendencies in him, so I think that function might be more balanced. Just in case any of you lurk over there.

Cheers!",1470360956
ISTJ,"I consistently test ISTJ.  Under times of stress or depression I have tested INTJ and INTP.  That is not what I am asking.  Has anyone ever changed from an ENTP to say ISTJ?  Does time have any effect?  Does environment?

The reason I ask is because I was extremely extroverted at one time.  I thrived on being in a crowd.  I could speak publicly with no problem.  I was energized by being around people.  I had many friends.  I was highly flexible and didn't stress when plans changed.  Now, I have 2 friends (only one of whom gets ""let in"" to a point).  I occasionally must speak to groups and it is highly draining.  I can't stand gathering where I'm expected to mingle and interact.  I'm very structured and organized.  If plans change it actually ruins the entire event for me.  Not saying I'm not adaptable.  My job requires me to adapt and overcome.  But, I was trained to do that.  It's not natural to me anymore.  

I don't know if growing older changed me, or if it was my military service.  Maybe both.  I am quite happy and comfortable as an ISTJ.  I look back on the extroverted me and just don't understand how I can be the same person.  I remember how happy and comfortable I was then, too.  People that knew me back then say how I've changed (and they don't mean it in a good way).  With rare exception, all those from my past have disappeared.  Well, I guess I am the one that disappeared into myself.  People I meet now don't believe some of the stories I tell from my past because it is just so out of character to what they see.  

So, is this common or at least explainable?",1470000549

**Dominant for ISTJ and ISFJ**

**Auxiliary for ESTJ and ESFJ**

*We seek to present a picture of the ‚Äúpure‚Äù Introverted Sensing that we would see if we could carefully remove it from its natural state where it is influenced and colored by all the other elements of personality. Though no process actually exists separated from the rest of the personality, the portrait that follows reflects core characteristics that are in play whenever Introverted Sensing is engaged at a conscious level.*

*Introverted Sensing most clearly resembles the descriptions in the following pages when it is in the dominant (first) position. In fact, these descriptions are based on input from people for whom the process is dominant (1STJ and ISFJ). But even with Introverted Sensing in the first position, what you observe will vary noticeably depending on other factors - particularly whether it is paired up with Extraverted Thinking or Extraverted Feeling in the auxiliary (second) position.*

*In order to draw a complete picture of the ‚Äúessence‚Äù of Introverted Sensing, one must use bits and pieces that cannot individually demonstrate ‚Äúpure‚Äù Si. Like the splashes of color in an impressionist painting, however, the bullets in this chapter, when taken all together, reveal a vivid portrait that will enable you to recognize Introverted Sensing when you see it. Knowing what the process would look like if it could be separated from other influences is the foundation of process watching, the practice that will quickly take you as far as you want to go in understanding personality.*
 
Introverted Sensing is an information - gathering process. It focuses on the subjective, internal world of past experience by comparing current sensory experiences to similar past experiences through a vivid and detailed internal database of memories. Si wants to relive the past and selectively explore the impact and significance of current events, people, and experiences.

**KEY FEATURES**

**Introverted Sensing** 

* Experiences the present world through comparison with previous experiences.
* Re-experiences the past sequentially, in vivid sensory detail.
* Focuses on the memories and comparisons that are triggered by current objects, people, and events.
* Stores sensory references from the past in a subjective internal database.
* Has a high level of internal body awareness.
* Subjectively selects what gets noticed in the present and recalled from the past.
* Seeks to use previous experience as a guide for exploring the current experience.

**WHAT‚ÄôS GOING ON?**

**Introverted Sensing**


* Sees the current world through subjective internal filters.
* Uses an external stimulus in the present to stimulate an internal experience: the recall of the past.
* Asks: How does this event in the present compare to similar events in the past? What is different? What is the same? How can it be improved?
* Resembles a mental Rolodex file, video, or database for sorting through the internal images to find the right reference.
* Enable accurate recall of all steps or events in the exact order in which they happened.
* Looks at what happened and how it could be improved. Learns from past mistakes.
* ls energized through combining vivid past experiences with the present to relive special moments.

**When people are using their preferred Introverted Sensing**

* Their past experience provides the frame of reference for comparison with their present experience. Much attention is paid to the facts and details of personally significant past experiences and how they are similar to or different from the present experience.
* Their memories are clear and detailed but subjective, so they will not necessarily agree with someone else‚Äôs recollection of the same events.
* Their most vivid memories are those that were most impactful. These memories are replayed over and over again with all the associated details and emotions. It is like actually physically reliving the event and re-experiencing the same emotions.
* They prefer and trust their subjective recall. They may simply ignore someone else‚Äôs conflicting version of events and rigidly defend their own. Accepting a different version would require changing the memory itself. It would be like re-recording the whole event.
* They are usually closely attuned to the physical condition and energy of their bodies.
* The current experience that is triggering a recollection may be integrated with the memory, or it may be virtually ignored if found to be not relevant to the memory.
* They may form associations with people or things in the present, based on someone or something similar from the past.
* The intensity of a previous experience determines what will be remembered. Watching a sunset does not bring to mind every sunset ever seen, just the significant ones. These could include the best sunset ever or ones associated with significant events like falling in love or the death of a loved one.
* They are referencing an internal database that is filled with an enormous amount of detail. The detail, however, is not 100 percent reliable as an objective record of the experience or event.
* Familiarity has a great impact on making a current event more comfortable because the more similar the event is to past ones, the more easily it can be compared to them internally.
* No one can change the internal references except the individual.
* The current data and experience are not real until they have been validated by comparison with a similar circumstance or experience.
* The recollection of a past event is automatically and immediately overlaid on the current experience.
* They interpret the current situation through association with previous experiences. Sometimes this produces brilliant insights. Often it gives them a surprisingly complete grasp of the current situation. Occasionally it leads to misinterpretation and erroneous assumptions.
* A smell or sound can trigger a flood of vivid memories, with all of the related emotions.
* The present stimulus can be disregarded and reliving the past can become the current experience.
* Their internal experience is about the most memorable one of its kind, whether good or bad, happy or sad.
* They may appear quiet and composed, while internally they are very active, perhaps even in turmoil.
* When something happens that is different from anything that they have personally experienced before, they need to find something that is similar in some way so it can be used for comparison.
* What is important to them is the subjective experience, not the present external event.
* They tend to do familiar activities well. Their internalized experiences, along with their ability to evaluate and compare them, serve as a reference library of best practices.
* They cannot be pressured into changing a memory. Creating it was very personal and vivid. Recreating it must be done independently as well.
* Remembered information is reality to them. Revising a memory is not just a matter of altering a record of an experience. It is like changing the experience itself.

**FROM THE OUTSIDE, LOOKING IN**

**When we experience people who are engaging their preferred Introverted Sensing, they**

* Do not always seem to be with us in the present. Sometimes, when they return from their reverie, they tell a story from their past that seems especially important to them.
* Seem to recall past events from a unique perspective. The specific details and emphasis are strongly colored by how they personally experienced the event.
* Tell about an event as a sequential, personal story. It is not like a ‚Äúreport,‚Äù in which one seeks to summarize the key objective facts of what happened and may make a point or reach a conclusion. Their reason for telling the story seems to be in the telling itself.
* Sometimes reject new information that might cause them to change their course of action.
* Are often predictable in their actions.
* Usually are well organized and neat.
* Are clear and confident about knowing what to do in any given setting or situation based on their prior experience.
* May show emotional behavior even when there is nothing in the current external environment to support or explain that emotion.
* May approach a task with statements such as ‚ÄúWe did something like this before and it was not successful. This part worked but that part didn‚Äôt. Here is how we can make it work better this time.‚Äù
* Often describe tangible items by comparison to other objects. They frequently use phrases that start with ‚Äúlooks like,‚Äù ‚Äúseems like,‚Äù ‚Äúfeels like,‚Äù and ‚Äútastes like.‚Äù
* Often compare events and situations to ones from the past. You may hear ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen this before‚Äù or ‚Äúthat reminds me of the time.‚Äù
* Understand concrete descriptions and stories that make a point through comparisons.  
* Can get side tracked into talking about topics that are related to the subject at hand rather than talking about the subject itself
* May seem to wander aimlessly through stories of questionable relevance as they search their internal database for the correct one to use for comparison. Sometimes it is difficult for others to listen patiently to them while they sort it out.
* May recount previous events in great detail. Sometimes only the storytellers themselves can see how those events are relevant to what is going on now.
* Can bring great insight to a situation through their past experiences.
* May go back and forth between two extremes of energy during a conversation. They could become animated and energetic if the subject evokes either happy or sad memories. On the other hand, they could show no interest at all if the subject is not something they have personally experienced.
* May not provide much input or feedback during group decision making unless allowed time to access their internal world.
* Can usually tell you exactly what you said at a specific time. If you disagree with them about what you said, they may become rigid in defending their recollection or totally shut down and not communicate at all
* May be difficult to get to know.
* Often have great confidence and certainty about the right way to do tasks.
* Tend to be dependable and stable.
* Have a learning style that is like rolling a carpet forward: linear, with each new learning an extension of the previous one.
* Usually cannot be convinced that they are not recalling facts accurately. The more they are pressured or coerced, the more resistant they become. They need to be allowed to decide for themselves whether their internal data is incorrect and given space to re-form their memory.
* Tend to accept change more easily when they can look to a similar transition in the past and find support for making the change in order to correct mistakes or improve a situation.

**CONTRIBUTIONS**

**Specific perspectives and approaches of Introverted Sensing**

* Internal structure and organization for any task, project or group
* Development of effective solutions based on past experience at lessons learned from previous mistakes
* Institutional memory and a sense of organizational continuity through a history of past successes and failures
* An internal template for how familiar tasks are done and how to build from experience to approach new tasks
* A high level of precise internal body awareness
* A calm and professional manner
* Insightfulness, usually without unnecessary assertiveness

**FROM THE INSIDE**

**Paraphrased descriptions of what it is like to gather information through one‚Äôs preferred Introverted Sensing**

* Experience is like constant de ja vu. Everyone occasionally has the experience of some sight or smell instantly transporting them to a vivid recollection of a past event, but for me it‚Äôs almost constant. It is where I live.
* My internal data is a lot like having detailed photographic plates that are available to me as a clear series of sequential pictures. It‚Äôs like a movie or video in my head that replays all the details over and over. It‚Äôs like a slide show or a mental Rolodex. The images always come to me in a certain order. These images are superimposed over what is going on in the present environment, which allows me to see all the similarities and differences.
* I relive the experience. I feel exactly what I felt before, just as intensely.
* I never use a camera because my internal pictures are so much more vivid and rich. Photographs are too flat and lifeless. The pictures inside are what really bring me back to a time and place.
* I know the day‚Äôs weather by looking at the sky and comparing it to the pictures of skies in my memory and remembering the weather we had on those days.
* Once I identify something, there‚Äôs usually no need to personally experience it any further. I get only what I need to trigger the relevant Images.
* I‚Äôm hesitant to embark on totally new ventures. I am much more comfortable when I have already experienced something similar.
* I am the only one who can revise a memory. Changing a memory is like destroying a valued object, like shattering a glass picture. It is done only when new additions to my internal database absolutely require revising the old material. Then I have to rebuild the memory from scratch.
* I am very good at knowing when something is not right with my body. Without thinking about it I constantly and automatically compare my internal readings, like heart rate, pain, and energy level, with their normal state. I can usually tell if something is wrong with me long before any doctor or medical test can pick it up.
* I don‚Äôt like a lot of change.
* If you talk to me about something I have not personally experienced, I may just blank out. I do not have a clue what you‚Äôre talking about because I don‚Äôt have a reference.
* I can recall in extreme detail the room layouts of places I have been. In department stores, my friends are amazed by how I can go to the exact location where we saw an item several weeks before.
* I enjoy shocking people by describing what they wore and what they said in a meeting ten years ago.
* I can describe, in great detail, several scenes and events that happened‚Äô when I was very young. I remember a lot about when I was sick as a child, even the clothes that my parents were wearing. I was nine months old when I was sick, and I can still recall the experience fifty years later.
* I really hate driving somewhere I‚Äôve never been before. When I do get directions, I prefer to get specific details such as mileage or landmarks to go by. Maps don‚Äôt work well for me. Once I‚Äôve been somewhere, I normally stick with the same route that I know.
* In choosing a career, I needed to reflect upon what had worked and not worked for me before and what I had liked and not liked in previous jobs.
* Whenever I drink a beer, I‚Äôm comparing it to my memory of the best ‚Äúperfect‚Äù beer. Every beer I ever taste is compared to that beer. If I ever taste one that‚Äôs better, I‚Äôll know it with certainty, and that will become my new standard of the perfect beer.
* I can remember every teacher I ever had. I can hear their voices, picture the classrooms, and remember most of my classmates and what we did.

**Scenes from the world of Introverted Sensing**

* A participant in a four-day workshop was able to describe in exact detail what each of the thirty-four participants had worn each day. She could also cross-reference those internal images and knew which people had worn the same articles twice.
* I experience a tree by overlaying that tree with memories of significant trees from the past. When I am looking at a tree, it could bring up pleasant childhood memories of a tree with a swing or maybe unpleasant memories of getting stuck in a tree. I‚Äôm sure that no one else would experience that same tree in the same way that I do because my past associations with trees are mine alone.
* If you bump into an old acquaintance with a preference for Introverted Sensing, your acquaintance may well proceed to tell you the details of your last encounter: where you were, what you were wearing, the weather, and what you talked about. He or she may make comparisons between the two meetings, such as noting changes in your hairstyle.
* In a restaurant, I‚Äôll remember what I ate there before or what I had at a similar restaurant. My menu selection will be based on this previous experience. If the menu choices are so completely strange to me that useful internal comparisons cannot be found, the waiter can be helpful by giving me something familiar to work with: by talking about the spices or the method of preparation or by comparing the menu items to the dishes that I know.
* In a scene with friends on a boat, I‚Äôll probably be drifting off in my mind to another boat ride. I‚Äôll be reliving what was happening, whom I was with, where we went, and what we saw.
* In a ‚Äútype-alike‚Äù group exercise that focuses on talking about an object, our group always includes memories triggered by, and usually closely associated with, the object. For example, when a bag of eight markers was provided for the exercise, we remembered working with sets of markers in the past. Of course, we also knew that there should have been ten markers in the set and which colors were missing.
* While planning with some business associates where to go for dinner, one young man said he wanted to go somewhere that served spareribs. He proceeded to tell us about a place in his hometown that served ‚Äúthe best ribs in the world.‚Äù As he was describing them, he came alive. His face became animated and he even began salivating. He said that he could actually taste the ribs. The others in the group were pulled into his experience by his vivid descriptions and his energy. But when he was done reliving the memory of those ribs, he no longer wanted ribs for dinner. He said that he had just experienced the best ribs in the world and any others would be a disappointment.
* My young nephew walked through the door and immediately wanted to know what happened to the rug in front of the door. Since I had removed the old rug a while ago, I didn‚Äôt immediately understand the question, so I asked, ‚ÄúWhat rug?‚Äù Taking my question as my not valuing his memory, he got angry, put his hands on his hips, stomped his foot, and said, ‚ÄúYou know, the green rug that was right here!‚Äù After I apologized and explained what had happened to it, he felt validated. He proceeded to compare the new rug with the old rug.
* A woman described her vacation to Cancun. As she talked, her facial expression changed. She was talking about how much she had enjoyed herself. She said she could smell the Cancun air, see the fish in the clear water, feel the breeze on her face, and hear the birds. She said she immediately had the same sense of relaxation she had while in Cancun.

**GIFTS**

**Unique strengths of Introverted Sensing**

* Awareness of when something is out of place, whether it is an object in a room or a step in a process.
* By comparison to a remembered internal image of the same environment or procedure
* Learn from past experience, to rarely make the same mistake twice
* A reliable knowledge of the steps, in sequence, involved in most events or projects
* Lend substance to the current situation by providing historical context
* Bring structure to the current task or situation based upon what has or has not worked before
* Careful attention to detail
* Detailed, vivid memory
* Stability",1469781537

Each year I usually find myself having a crush on someone and become infatuated. I stalk their Facebook, learn everything I can about them, fanticize our lives together, and end up barely ever talking to them. They have always been healthy crushes at a safe distance. 

this year though, I liked a guy who I thought liked me back so I allowed myself to fall for him. We became close, I told him things I never tell anyone, I fantasized our lives together, tried to make it obvious I liked him which I never do. He turned out to have a girlfriend. blehh But I stayed his friend, still secretly obsessed with him and it was just so unhealthy and embarrassing.

They dress more feminine than me sometimes!

It makes sense, you being Dom-Si. While they like wearing jewellery, glitter, false nails, frills, and makeup, I would describe their style as still modest, plain, and relatively unexperimental. I notice they tend to opt for matchy-matching (over-doing their one favourite colour rather than mixing it up with a complimentary palette), block colours, simple lines and shapes, popular brands... things I have a tendency to label as ""safe"" and boring.

No offence meant. Everyone is entitled to their own style, and I know I am usually opposite to ISTJs. It's just a surprising observation.

Romance and connection is what you need to create to keep that lil INFP coming back for more :D wait....where are you going? Oh just vomited on yourself....it's ok, I'll wait for you to come back....
*whistles*


How does one simulate connection?

-it's in the eyes: slightly lingering glances with a slight smile. Try to notice your INFPs eyes when they are flirting with you: notice their eyes are more alive and sparkling (?watery even?!??) when they talk with the person they admire. If you can pick up on this and return it with a slightly shy smile, INFP will feel connected.

-letting them know you're checking them out, but subtly not like 'casualhourglass I stared at her chest ALL NIGHT and she punched me you liar'

-use a softer tone of voice with them than with others - INFP will notice this

-doing little things that show you were thinking about them when they were out of sight
 - a tiny inexpensive thing achieves as much as costly stuff. Eg, you know INFP likes chocolate bar X, so you buy it and leave it in her bag or on his desk.

-this is important: shared private jokes. Make a reference to something in a group that only the two of you fully understand - execute with classic ISTJ dry style and you've got one INFP laughing or staring at you with big round eyes that are sparkling. And do this without giving a crap about including others - the trick is to make your INFP feel special above the other people in the room.

-tell your INFP stuff about yourself, once you trust them of course (BUT DONT FRIKKIN WAIT 1000 YEARS UNTIL THERES JUST A SKELETON REMAINING NEXT TO YOU WHERE THE FRIKKIN INFP ONCE WAS. YOU HAVE TO RISK STUFF TO CONNECT. like, waiting till INFP dies will, to be fair, reduce the chances of your secrets being retold...I admit your logic is strong BUT I DONT LIKE IT). Tell INFP stuff about the inner you that no-one else knows. This is the currency of connection for an INFP, if we're telling you secrets we are extremely close to you, or are trying to become so. Tell stuff that counts, like the times you realised you didn't want to become your dad, or what rejection did to make you who you are, why you stay in your job even though you don't love it, what your first pet meant to you. 


Romance: 
Having a connection is the daily bread n butter for a happy INFP - if you can for that stuff every day or at least a few times a week, I expect INFP will tick along without complaints.  Don't leave it more than a week without connecting on some level.

Other things (we're pretty cheap dates ha!)

-take us for a walk somewhere pretty - cool cityscape, beach, forest, or just round the block with you will ,are us happy; why? You're holding our hands for one :p. We get your full attention. We both will chat and connect. There's no other goal for the activity (from your perspective) other than to be with us = INFP HAPPY.

-we love books apparently...soooo (DONT VOMIT AGAIN) you know that scene in Beauty and the Beast....(stay with me here) when he tskes her to the library? Well, kinda like that but a bit less cheesy...*casualhourglass sprints away being pelted with ISTJ slippers and insults* or museums will do instead of libraries, or art galleries. Just take us there and show us a couple of cool bits you think are relevant to us (oh look, it's Kurt Cobains autobiography on this shelf...or here is the ancient Egypt display...)

-take us out one night to a place you can see the stars amazing without too much light pollution, have a couple of blankets packed and a thermos, and just go sit silently with your INFP watching them for a while. In your brain you may be like, that's pretty sweet to look at, but your INFPs mind will be traversing galaxies, imagining other worlds, cresting plot lines and poetry in a world of wonder next to you...and thinking how did she ever deserve this sex-on-legs-man-beast of an ISTJ next to her. Same applies for ISTJ girls with their INFP bloke, just hopefully without the beast part in his head...*date not going so well otherwise*


Right, too much writing. Hope this is of interest to someone out there and you don't ban me from your otherwise rational and brief subreddit. Feel free to ask and questions &lt;3 yes, I'll come to your weddings, thanks for asking.....*shucks*",1467628387

I'm kinda madly in love with this ISTJ dude.

Having a mom with neurosis who is also ISTJ used to leave me with a somewhat bad impression of the type (sorry!). I worried the paranoia was a trait.

But omg this guy is just the best!

I'm incredibly attracted to him, which stuns me. I haven't felt this way about anyone, and honestly never expected to fall in love like this with anybody beyond like, an INFJ.

However, we've had some rocky starts due to misunderstandings. Before we were just dating and had fights because I didn't realize he wanted to be intimate on our first date. I was naive and thought he was allowing me to sleep over because it was late.


I then had another fight with him when he found out I was speaking to another guy (he told me he spoke to other girls in the past while dating (while unofficial)). Turns out I'm the exception and he wanted me to commit to him only


Now we're actually official


And I intend to be faithful - ENTPs are amazingly loyal to our partners, and I've heard you guys are as well.

However, we've already had two big fights due to misunderstandings

I don't think the faithfulness bit will be a trouble at all anymore as we're committed now

But what else can I expect so I can avoid fighting accidentally?


I know being on time is huge to him, and I'm working hard on that


Thanks in advance for the advice, loves!

ISTJ,"Hi ISTJs,

I am INTP male who was recently cut out by a friend, an ISTJ female. I really like her and  I would like to get back to being friends with her and do not want to let go so easily.

To give you guys a background :

We knew each other for almost two years. We became friends and went out (as friends) for the last two months. During this time we both enjoyed each others company. When asked whether she liked me, she said she is cool with me and that is why she made time to spend with me. 

During this time I did bother her occasionally with my N and my T and my drill down questions. Typical INTP curiosity I guess.

After the two months time we had to move to different places. We still kept in touch via skype. during this period, I was alone at my new place and managed to piss her off with frequent messages and pushy questions. My immaturity did its part too.

She didn't like any of these. I failed to realize that I was being too pushy and was being too naggy. So one day she tells me that I am constantly obnoxious and she has had enough of me. She says Bye and ended all contact.

It has been three weeks now since we had any contact with each other. 

In the mean time I have realized many of the stupid things I did to her and I have decided to change my ways. Not just towards her, but towards everyone.

The problem is that, I want to let her know that I have realized the problems I had. I am trying to be better and am changing. Above all this, I want us to be back to being friends. Right now I do not trust my self enough to go back to her because I haven't changed enough. I am waiting for a time to tell her all this and want her to know that I will come back.

I am afraid that as time goes by, she will become more distant and by the time I think I am ready to get back to her, it might be a little too late. I do not want to rush this and piss her off again.

How can I put these to words that an ISTJ would understand? How long should I wait to contact her before she forgets me?

ISTJ,"I'm strikingly uncompetitive.  If I feel like I've done my best, and everyone has had a decently good time, then I'm generally happy, even if I lose.  I've noticed that this applies to board games, sports, whatever.  In fact, I'll often help out opponents (say, in a board game) if I feel like it would make the game more fun or interesting.

In fact, I actively dislike playing with people who are super-competitive, the people who get angry or downcast when things are going badly for them, or seem thrilled with victory.

ISTJ,"I've been dating my ISTJ boyfriend for over 5 years now (I'm an ISFJ). He's generally less willing to outwardly express his emotions, so he's always a solid rock when I get overwhelmed. 

However, he's never been able to ""graciously"" accept a compliment from me. Even if I say I like the way he styled his hair, or if a shirt/pair of jeans looks good on him, he only says ""sorry,"" or ""okay."" I have to remind him that he can just say ""thanks"" and that his responses make him sound a little ungrateful, or like he doesn't appreciate the compliment.

ISTJ,"Hi all. Male INTP here. I have a female ISTJ co-worker who I've been working with for the past month, and I have trouble figuring out if she's interested in me romantically. 

When its just the two of us speaking alone, we get along great. We joke around and have great conversations where we'll both actively contribute to the discussion. If she passes me in the hall she'll make an effort to say hi. But whenever we are in a group, she almost seems to ignore me. For example, if a group of co-workers are going to eat lunch together, it almost seems like she deliberately sits a few spaces away from me, or that sort of thing. 
I'm thinking of asking her out, but I do not want to make things weird as we will be working together for the rest of the summer.

ISTJ,"My fellow ~NT~ friend and I are throwing around an idea for a podcast. People write in and we dispense rational, scientific based advice, divorced of feeling or sympathy, a la Data / Spock from Star Trek.

It would require research on our part for some questions. For example, if someone writes in about a contentious relationship, we'd have to look up the different styles of amygdala  hijack (fight or flight response to stress) and how to deescalate the situation. 

There would be NO ""tell the person how you feel"" or ""just be yourself"" or ""love yourself at your size"", feeler advice. 

Just cold hard, science based, advice and an action plan attached to it. And of course some ~NT~ snark. 

So I'm taking a survey. 

How many of you think this could make an entertaining podcast? 

Additionally....

We are currently taking advice requests from people 18+ to make a dummy run of the podcast (to gauge how long it should be, editing, style etc)

Our test run will not be put out to the general public, but if your letter is selected we will send you the audio file of our test run. 

Of course, your identity would remain anonymous. 

You can send a letter here.

ISTJ,"ISTJs, I need some advice about work place professionalism.  I'm pretty young, 21, and have been working for this small company for 2 and a half years, starting as an intern and being officially employed 6 months ago.  Since they hired me officially, I've had to work under this one project manager who proves to me again and again his level of incompetence.  I have an incredibly low tolerance for incompetent leadership.  I realize he's been with the company for many years, so he *must* be doing his job right, but as far as I can tell, he's an idiot.

I'm the youngest, least experienced person on the team, yet often times he comes to me asking me questions about the project (because, -sheepish smile- he should know this, but he doesn't remember) or things I have no clue about because 1) Did not go to school for this area. 2) My internship did not cover this.  3) This is the first project I've worked on like this.  I don't understand how he expects me to answer questions or form opinions about things I know jack shit about.  Yes, I am unofficially the ""jack of all trades"" at work so I do a lot of jobs that I haven't gone to school for or done before, but the things he's asking me about are *way* out of my field of familiarity or realm of knowledge. When I ask for guidance or try to ask questions, he pretty much turns it around on me and leaves me with no answers because ""I'm a smart cookie.  I'll figure it out.""  

Yada, yada, rant, rant... the more I work with him, the more I dislike him.  He seems very disorganized and insecure about his decisions and in need of constant affirmation and reassurance.  I am to the point where I realize I am acting passive aggressive/hostile toward him.  I realize this whole post and situation reflect my own immaturity and impatience, but I just can't even feign pleasantness anymore.  I'm looking for a new job, but I can't be sure how soon I'll find something in my area.  Honestly, it would be better if I could just find a way to work with this guy--especially since there are always going to be people in every job who annoy me, so might as well learn how to cope, right?

I realize it essentially boils down to ""grow up and deal with it"" but I'm really hoping you guys have some tips for how to do that.  This job isn't the greatest, but it's definitely not the worst and it seems like a dumb reason to leave because I had an issue working with someone.

Recently I found out that he is ISTJ 37 y.o. (or an ambi-STJ) and that we are polar opposites. This explains a lot as he kept saying 'you are too abstract', whenever I spoke about anything that interested me, which really made me wonder what he meant, and what I am doing wrong. I love being with him, as he notices things I don't and sees the world in such a different way, I LOVE it. And also, I really value the honesty he brings to table. Such a gem!

I have a few questions:

1) He is very reliable at texting back when I send him chatty texts (at least once a day so far). He doesn't play games, but I wonder if he is just being polite. He has never yet initiated a conversation but is so enthusiastic in his replies. He is also quite a busy person.

2) Last night I texted him about meeting up when his current work project was done, and although he read the message he hasn't got back to me. Finding this very confusing! He has been very enthusiastic about planning things so far. (We even have a date fixed ten days from now, but I just wanted to see him before that too as it's a while away).

3) Our chemistry is crazy, and he is very physical! But I find it hard to know how to connect with him in bed. I mean...I don't even know him and we haven't even talked about it, etc. He thinks that I should just observe his reactions and KNOW. I think he treats it like a science project, which he agrees is sort of true. I love that we can laugh about our differences.

4) He said that I shouldn't 'fill up space' by talking, and that silence is communicative. So when I stay silent he thinks that I am just withdrawing into myself. I am so confused. What can I do with silence? It's...silence! Especially since we haven't known each other long, how can it be anything else?

Anyway, advice please. This has just been a week and a half going, and I just want to know what is going on in his head and how I can communicate with him better.

But any insight anyone can give would be greatly appreciated. I'll try to answer any questions as fast as I can as well. Thanks for your time :)

Needless to say, I feel absolutely terrible. My life for the past 6 years has been destroyed. Then 3 weeks later someone decided to drop a huge nuke the remains. I don't know how to process this... I don't know how to keep going. I'm sorry in advance if this post is way too long or breaks any rules or anything. I just need to say things... I'll try not to ramble about my feelings too much...


I don't know where to begin with this... We met in high school. We were each others' first super serious relationship. She was one of the most beautiful girls I'd ever had the good fortune to meet. We had so much in common, our sense of humor was so in sync, we had so many of the same interests. She was my absolute best friend and I was hers. We told each other everything. We were perfect for each other.


As I'd said before, we were each others' first serious relationship. I was a stupid teenager the first couple years. I made my fair share of mistakes. The first, and worst, of which being that I made friends with a girl (100% platonic) and my girlfriend, being a very jealous type, didn't take too kindly to how close we were getting and told me she didn't want me talking to her anymore. I fought with her about it. I knew deep down there was nothing wrong with being friends with a girl, so I lied and said I'd end the friendship. When in reality I continued to be friends with her. I, of course, eventually came clean on my own a few months later. And she forgave me. And I never forgot that.


I loved her. I still love her. But She had her faults as well. But unlike mine, though they improved a bit as time went on, they continued on for the whole 6 years. She was jealous. Very jealous. I wasn't allowed to be friends with girls she didn't approve of for the first 2 or 3 years of our relationship. Until one day she made a male friend and they became close and she changed her mind. But I had to tell her if I get their number or if I ever hung out with them. She was controlling. Didn't like me going to raging parties, would get mad if I didn't text her back, especially if she knew I was with friends, she didn't like me looking at porn for the first 2 years, among other things. This may sound harsh... But She was also emotionally manipulative, every argument about something I do that she doesn't like would end in an ultimatum. ""Your behavior hurts me, and If you don't fix your behavior, you don't care about my feelings"". I'm paraphrasing, of course, But that's basically what it always boiled down to. It made me feel like a terrible boyfriend every time I had an opposing opinion on an issue. And for a long time, I believed I was. So I tried so hard, so very hard to prove to her just how much I loved her. And it came naturally to me, because I truly did love her. So much. But every new argument made me feel like everything i had done and was still doing didn't matter. Only what she wanted me to do now.


On top of all that, sex was a major problem... At least for me. But I never let on just how much of a problem it was for me. We were each others' first. And since then, in the 6 years we've had sex a total of 6 times. We've talked about it multiple times and each time she's said she doesn't know what's wrong with her, she just had a low sex drive for some reason. And I was as understanding as I could possibly be about it. I never pressured her into anything. On the rare occasion I would somehow make her feel pressured, I'd feel absolutely terrible. We, of course, did other sexual things. And by we, I mean I would do things for her, and ALMOST never the other way around. It was honestly like pulling teeth to get her to reciprocate. Ever. But I always there for her needs. Because I just wanted to make her happy. It legitimately made me happy to know I made her happy...


I know that last paragraph sounded like me just ranting and venting about what a terrible person she was. And I know that all this stuff must be like HUGE red flags that I should have noticed and left her a long time ago. And I think I'm finally realizing that aching feeling I kept feeling that last year was resentment towards her. And it kills me. I hate that I allowed myself to feel that way about her while I was with her. Because even with all this, I saw the truly good person that she truly was underneath all of that. And I loved that part of her the most. And I held on to the hope that that part of her would eventually come to the forefront and shed finally treat me better. Because as time went on, she seemed to get a little better. Slowly but surely.


And then we broke up... At the end, we had been living together for a few months. I was paying rent for both of us. The day before our 6 year anniversary I knew stuff was going sour between us for about a month or so and I wanted to talk to her before our anniversary to make sure we were ok. Long story short, over the course of 20 minutes, she said she pretty much didn't love me anymore and was done trying. That alone was devastating. But then she refused to talk to me again about it. There was so much more I needed to say at least for closure. But She refused to humor me for just a few minutes. And that hurt me a lot, it made me feel like she was willing to deny me much needed closure just to save herself from a few minutes of awkwardness. And that angered me. A lot. I, much to my regret, went full ENFP bitch slap. Just to preface, after the break up, I was sleeping in a separate room, on the floor, with nothing but a blanket, while she kept our room since her stuff was big and the bed was hers. So in my rage storm, I told her to get out of MY room, since I was still payingrent at the time. I even went as far as to CAREFULLY move a good portion of her stuff out of the room while she was at work. It was a dick move, I know. But I was just so mad.


Then... I found out from a friend a couple weeks later that she is already dating another guy... At that moment I heard something break inside me. It was only 3 weeks. Is that how much our 6 year long relationship meant to her? Everything I had done in all that time. All the pain I felt directly because of her, meant 3 weeks to her... A million waves of different emotions crashed down on me at once. And sadness, betrayal and anger remained. I THEN found out WHO it was. It was a guy she knew about 8 months before we broke up... She met him on an online game. Destiny to be exact. As far as I know they had never previously met in person. Is this fucked up or am I just crazy?


I just don't know what to feel... How to feel. I already felt so lost without her. And now this... I just can't. I'm just wondering What the hell I did to deserve this. I must have done something. right?",1458710609
ISTJ,"I've always had a real love for wordplay (I think it's one of the most clever forms of wit out there, and I also just think it's stupidly funny), and I've seen a few places associate ISTJ humour with puns. So I'm interested in how other ISTJs view puns. Do you love them? Hate them? Don't really care? 

If you don't like wordplay, what is your sense of humour?",1458632759

ISTJ,"Not sure if the above are ISTJ traits but I usually experience those traits a lot and I will explain further.

When it comes to being emotional, I just can't fake it. In situations where one is supposed express emotions, I usually come off as neutral or disinterested which isn't always the case deep down.

This leads to lack of excitement for other people or stuff. When I set goals for a specific time frame and accomplish them, I feel excited but when someone tells me about their own accomplishments, I struggle to feel excited for them. I'm not jealous or anything but its just natural for me not to feel so hyped for them.

Finally when it comes to expressing feelings, I usually have no clue. I'm just like ""ok"" and that's it. Inside, I get these feelings but can't transfer them outside or to body language which can seem awkward sometimes.

I'm not a sadist or anything along that line but I just wanna know if it's normal for ISTJs to feel this way.

Even though I enjoy my evening in, I feel overly regretful/upset when I see everyone post photos of the event or talk about how much fun it was.

ISTJ

ISTJs at their best are dedicated and pragmatic individuals who understand what it takes to get the job done and always put their best effort into the tasks they choose to undertake.  They are extremely knowledgeable about the inner workings of all the systems and physical relationships in the world, in large part because they have spent the time to learn how to do things right and observed how everything works and fits together.  They seem to others to have an amazing memory and are often skilled at making connections between present and past experiences or events that others miss.  That said, they often find themselves uncomfortable with change and new situations where they‚Äôre unable to draw on past experiences for clues as to how to act or interpret the situation.  Their primary interest is in developing a mental ‚Äúowner‚Äôs manual‚Äù for the world, cataloging every necessary piece of information in order to become as efficient and effective as possible.

ISTJs believe that the best way to understand the world is to observe the collection of objective facts and analyses that humanity has accumulated over the millennia, trusting that ages of experience have whittled down methods and understanding into only the most valuable and trustworthy pieces of information.  They do not trust first impressions or subjective logic, and prefer instead to find out what works and what‚Äôs true based on the body of scientific and practical knowledge in the world.  It is important, however, for ISTJs to reflect on their own desires and beliefs about themselves and the values they hold dear, as the information you get from the outside world is not sufficient to answer every question.  ISTJs who allow themselves to explore their own feelings and values without rejecting them too quickly for being unverifiable objectively will discover, with pleasure, that doing so allows them to focus their energy and effort on ventures that bring them personal fulfillment and allow them to find meaning in their work.

A young or immature ISTJ will not seek out new opportunities or adapt easily to change, and will often feel as though life is changing too fast, or the world has moved on without them.  They do not take kindly to any suggestion that the way they‚Äôre used to doing things may not be the best way, or that the perspective they‚Äôve come to accept as fact is actually merely an erroneous opinion based on misinterpreted or inadequate evidence.

However, as the ISTJ grows and matures, they will begin to find a balance between understanding the implications of all the experience they have accumulated in the past, and being able to see the wealth of opportunities and new perspectives that open up before them in the future.  They will become more flexible in considering their options, understanding the world not merely as a fixed object with a rigid set of rules, but also as a manipulable entity that can be shifted and adjusted at will.  They will find themselves seeking out opportunities to experience new perspectives, and will become more comfortable at listening or watching with an open mind to see if they can learn something new.  That said, ISTJs will always be more reliable and effective than most other types, making sure that things get done the right way and that they and other people are making judgments and decisions based on the best information possible, rarely allowing passing whims to sidetrack them from the essential task at hand.

Mature ISTJs are very good at taking objectively accepted facts and analyzing or evaluating them to judge whether they are logically consistent and accurate - whether they actually ‚Äòmake sense‚Äô to them - given the other propositions that they hold to be true, but they often do not find much pleasure or gratification in engaging with this ability unless it‚Äôs in service of some larger goal or in order to help someone they care about.  Because they are so focused on noticing patterns and forming conclusions based on how things have worked in the past for them, they resist efforts to interpret each individual situation anew, drinking in the details of the world around them and watching for changes or novel stimuli without immediately comparing them to similar situations from their past.  However, when they are sufficiently motivated, they are very skilled at performing this kind of observation, and those who allow themselves to practice this skill will find it to be very useful when they are faced with new situations or required to act quickly and reflexively.

ISTJs do not enjoy navigating the complex world of human interaction, and will often find themselves confused or annoyed with other people‚Äôs emotional expression and social expectations.  They often prefer to ask for advice or information from someone whose skills in these areas they trust to help them process and solve these sorts of issues.  That said, they are capable of doing it - begrudgingly - when no help is available.  ISTJs find it very difficult to make predictions about which possible outcome of a situation is most *likely* and which perspective is most *correct* when they do not have relevant experience or objective information to refer to.  Although they may, with much determination, be capable of developing a grand, ambitious vision for an unknown future endeavor, it is not where they thrive.  They prefer to work hard at improving and developing concrete goals where success or failure are measurable and predictable.

To summarize, ISTJs are grounded and effective individuals who seek to understand the inner workings of the world in order to achieve their goals and keep their lives and the lives of those they care about running smoothly.  They do so by observing the consequences of their past actions and activities as well as by seeking out and absorbing the wealth of knowledge available to them from the outside world.  When they balance these skills with a nod toward their own personal values and desires as well as an awareness of the new possibilities and perspectives that can be discovered, they can be extraordinarily successful and effective individuals, performing great feats of accomplishment through hard work and sheer determination that leave the rest of the world marveling in awe.",1457711345
ISTJ,"INFJ here, very casually internally speculating on the enneagram type of an ISTJ in my life (who I think is quite wonderful, BTW). Got to wondering how someone might differentiate between the ""doing things as a way to show care"" ISTJ approach on one hand, and the service orientation of an enneagram 2 on the other. If that makes any sense.

Thoughts, anyone?

*PS Based on my experience so far, I really really like how ISTJs do things from that Si-Te-Fi-Ne stack of yours. I don't want to overgeneralize, but just so you know, I have tons of respect for ISTJs at this point.*",1457595076
